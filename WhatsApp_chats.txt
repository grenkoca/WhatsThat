8/18/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: I never had one!
8/18/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: I was undoubtedly the uncoolest kid in middle school
8/18/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: And yay!  Send pictures of you can!
8/18/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: We walked over closer to my campus today but not quite that far
8/18/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: It's raining a bit, so it's not super pretty
8/18/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: I'll take some pictures anyway so you have an idea of what it looks like
8/18/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: I don't actually live in Copenhagen though, I live in Frederiksburg
8/18/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: So we're taking the metro in

8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Marianna: And let me tell you is that gonna make me late some days
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: The metro system is awesome here
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: You don't even swipe in
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: It's honor system
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Marianna: And also when it gets to be cold I‚Äôm not gonna be happy
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Marianna: Yeah it looks like that here too
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: And they check maybe 1 in 10 times
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Marianna: I was told don‚Äôt but a pass because no one checks
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna
8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Oh it's already sweater weather here

8/18/19, 4:50 PM - Marianna: Yay!  Happy sweater Caleb!
8/18/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: I'll send you tons of pictures as soon as there's nice weather
8/18/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: But holy moly this place is cool
8/18/19, 4:56 PM - Marianna: Yeah I saw on Margaux‚Äôs story it looks cloudy and foggy
8/18/19, 4:56 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so good I‚Äôm glad you like your new little home
8/18/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: What have you been up to in Budapest?
8/18/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: How's your last day with your family going?
8/18/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Also update: we've now made it into the classrooms
8/18/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: We went across the river into buda today
8/18/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Went up the hill
8/18/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Saw the city
8/18/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Had lunch
8/18/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Came down the hill
8/18/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Got on the metro
8/18/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Saw the iconic parliament building
8/18/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Then went home
8/18/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: And now we‚Äôre getting ready for dinner/just chilling but it‚Äôs impossible to nap because it‚Äôs impossible for these people to be quiet. It‚Äôs genuinely not a them thing it‚Äôs just you can‚Äôt have 3 people in a room with you who are up and doing things and have it quiet enough to sleep in my opinion
8/18/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: How are the classrooms/campus!
8/18/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: If was a lot of fun! It's in the middle of the city
8/18/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: So it's all pretty much localized
8/18/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: And so we found a really hole in the wall place for crepes and cider
8/18/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: And it's a muggy, cool day
8/18/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: I read that as hole in the wall for creeps
8/18/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: And was like Caleb no
8/18/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Did you go with Reid?
8/18/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah and a handful of other people
8/18/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: We've got a solid group going
8/18/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: But it's orientation so we'll see how it goes
8/18/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: Groups don't tend to survive orientation
8/18/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: So oh LORD no
8/18/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm going WILD in Copenhagen Marianna
8/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: How many people are in your program?
8/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: How many people have you met yet?
8/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: My orientation doesn‚Äôt start until WEDNESDAY
8/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: So maybe I‚Äôll just make friends with the one guy I‚Äôll meet tomorrow at the airport and hang with him
8/18/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: Most people have other people in their apartments also doing the program but because I requested Sarah, I don‚Äôt so I hope I‚Äôm not behind socially
8/18/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: I've met maybe like 30? I've only been hanging out with about 7 though
8/18/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: The one guy you'll meet at the airport? Is it a sign up thing?
8/18/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Also apparently Marion wants to go out tonight
8/18/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: And Reid just told everyone how he met Marion
8/18/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: And I don't think you will! It's going to be a lot easier once class and other activities get started
8/18/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: Are you getting nervous?
8/18/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/18/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/18/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: So someone from AIT is picking all of us up at the airport and some guy is landing around when I‚Äôll get there to drop my parents off so AIT is getting both of us at the same tome
8/18/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm sorry...
8/18/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Maybe talk to Reid if you don‚Äôt want everyone to know?
8/18/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Hahaha no it's totally fine
8/18/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: I honestly don't mind
8/18/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Oh woah nice digs
8/18/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: At least your apartment looks big
8/18/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: It's pretty large! Good space for hosting
8/18/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: Really well decorated
8/18/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
8/18/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: Did you guys do the decorating?
8/18/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: My day was good!  Very ready for it to be tomorrow so I can move in
8/18/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very ready to not live out of a suitcase
8/18/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: We just got back from dinner
8/18/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: I had phenomenal rose wine and it was less than $2 a glass
8/18/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Love Budapest
8/18/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Idk if I told you or Sarah but we went over to buda today (so across the river and the side that my school is on) and i liked how quiet and town-like it was over there where this side is much more city
8/18/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: But I like the city
8/18/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see how loud the apartment is
8/18/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: It seemed to be in a happening area in the party district
8/18/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh no we most certainly did not decorate
8/18/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: And that's great! I love some peace and quiet in a city! It's always so surprising
8/18/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Copenhagen will definitely have on of those
8/18/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Wait then who did
8/18/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm excited to do some more exploring this week
8/18/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Find places near and far
8/18/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: All with my trusty andiamo by my side
8/18/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: It was already decorated! There are permanent residents here
8/18/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: We live with two of them, they're native Danes and made it home
8/18/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Good ol andiamo
8/18/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Veev hasn't seen much action today
8/18/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: It was raining so I didn't want to risk it
8/18/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Also
8/18/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I'm with my friends, and we've drank 3 bottles of prosecco, and are playing cards against humanity
8/18/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs cool
8/18/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Not really sure what permanent residents mean like I thought you were in a dorm but I think I kind of get it
8/18/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: You need a hue de plui
8/18/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll tell you that story sometime
8/18/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds like such a fun Sunday night!!!
8/18/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt wait to make friends and do that
8/18/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Have you played any radically good hands so far?
8/18/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Oh christ you know if
8/18/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: It
8/18/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: We should put "play cards against humanity" on the list
8/18/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: I am down with that
8/18/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt have the game
8/18/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sure we can figure out a way to play it
8/18/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs it online or something?
8/18/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: Oh I should get Joey a game of it for Christmas this year
8/18/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Have you ever seen a picture of people and you just KNOW that will be one that is uncovered when looking through old pictures and take that person back and make them say to whoever is with them ‚Äúoh look. This was me when I was x years old in x place‚Äù?
8/18/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Have fun tonight!  Goodnight!
8/18/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah! I've definitely seen pictures like that! It sounds like you've got a story for me tomorrow!
8/18/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: And I'm sure Joey would love that, and it would ABSOLUTELY be used in college
8/18/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: Just don't let him open it in front of your parents
8/18/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: Unless they're fine with that
8/18/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: But goodnight! I'm about ready to go to bed too
8/18/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you tomorrow!
8/19/19, 7:34 AM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt really have one of those from yesterday
8/19/19, 7:35 AM - Marianna: My dad did send me the last picture he took of me in front of chambers right before davidson kicked all the parents out the Friday of orientation because that was 2 years ago yesterday
8/19/19, 7:36 AM - Marianna: My parents know about it because everyone played it at speech and debate tournaments
8/19/19, 7:36 AM - Marianna: Exciting day today!
8/19/19, 7:37 AM - Caleb: Oh hey good morning!
8/19/19, 7:38 AM - Caleb: Man, orientation was wild
8/19/19, 7:39 AM - Caleb: I feel like it must have been hard for our parents for very different reasons because you're the first and I'm the last
8/19/19, 7:39 AM - Caleb: Must have felt very different
8/19/19, 7:39 AM - Caleb: It's funny because my mom was totally fine for the whole thing, and when they dropped me off she was trying to get my dad out before he got emotional
8/19/19, 8:00 AM - Marianna: Orientation freshman year?  Or like this past weekend?
8/19/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: My mom didn‚Äôt cry I do t thinkand we were all AMAZED at that
8/19/19, 8:02 AM - Marianna: Now she‚Äôs hugging me and like oh I can‚Äôt wait for December

8/19/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: That's so sweet
8/19/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: My parents just stood awkwardly by security and watched me go through
8/19/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: How are you doing?
8/19/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Hello!
8/19/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Sorry!  It‚Äôs been a whirlwind of a day!
8/19/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: And I haven‚Äôt eaten anything!
8/19/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: But left my parents at the airport and met two students there and then went to my apartment and then went on a walk with my mentor and am now back
8/19/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: And I need to do laundry and also food shopping
8/19/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: And I should eat

8/19/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: It's been a busy day for me too
8/19/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: How do you like the other students? Are they nice?
8/19/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: I had coffee
8/19/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: They were nice!
8/19/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: One was from SoCal and the other from Mongolia
8/19/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: WOAH that's quite the spread
8/19/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: I'm picking up textbooks right now
8/19/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: Ah fun
8/19/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: Are they more or less expensive than us textbooks
8/19/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
8/19/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Lemme tell ya
8/19/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Idk because they're free for us to loan
8/19/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Or I guess included in tuition would be a more accurate statement
8/19/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs nice
8/19/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: Idk if I‚Äôm gonna need textbooks or what
8/19/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: I guess I will find out
8/19/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: You said orientation starts Wednesday right? What do you think you'll do in the meantime?
8/19/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: Who knows
8/19/19, 1:44 PM - Marianna: Probably explore and adjust
8/19/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: And Sarah gets there when?
8/19/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: September 3rd I think
8/19/19, 1:53 PM - Caleb: Oh man
8/19/19, 1:53 PM - Caleb: You'll probably have your own friend group by the time she gets here then
8/19/19, 1:53 PM - Caleb: Just schoop her into it
8/19/19, 2:00 PM - Marianna: AH
8/19/19, 2:00 PM - Marianna: THAT SCARES ME
8/19/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: You'll be great! You're a wonderful, very likeable person and you'll have no issue making friends!
8/19/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Just put yourself out there
8/19/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Be willing to look silly
8/19/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: It's worked out for me, ish
8/19/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Ah but still I don‚Äôt want to make them without her like
8/19/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: The people I like are not necessarily the people she likes
8/19/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: Oooh
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: Remember how I said I was hungry
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: I need to go buy food
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: What do I want to cook this week?
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Well
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Depends
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: I'd say start with something familiar and easy
8/19/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: And work your way to more local food
8/19/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: So pick up some chicken, pick up some cream and tarragon, and make chicken in tarragon cream sauce!
8/19/19, 2:04 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/19/19, 2:04 PM - Marianna: That is good
8/19/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been trying chicken paprikash at restaurants because that‚Äôs the trademark dish
8/19/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: I think I might just do pasta tonight at least I‚Äôm kind of tired and don‚Äôt want to spend 2 hours in the kitchen
8/19/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôll do that and make a basil cream sauce
8/19/19, 2:10 PM - Caleb: Do it!
8/19/19, 2:11 PM - Caleb: My parents' Swedish background and visiting Sweden is definitely paying off right now
8/19/19, 2:11 PM - Caleb: I'm already kinda familiar with what Danes eat now
8/19/19, 2:12 PM - Caleb: There's this thing called l√•ngfil, and it's like a thick, fermented yogurt
8/19/19, 2:12 PM - Caleb: And so I'm having that, museli, and slided banana for a snack
8/19/19, 2:12 PM - Caleb: Oh! And the chocolate
8/19/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Ah I‚Äôm so hungry
8/19/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: But I said I‚Äôd go grocery shopping with one of the guys I met today in an HOUR
8/19/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll just run downstairs to the coffee shop and get like a croissant
8/19/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Black Coffee Morning by Bluebiird

8/19/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: Do it! It's the first few days
8/19/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: Give yourself some room to get on your feet
8/19/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: Even if that means dropping some money
8/19/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: And woah! Sounds like you've already made your first friend
8/19/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: Got a chocolate cinnamon roll thing
8/19/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: Idk if friend or literally only person I‚Äôve met is the categories
8/19/19, 2:32 PM - Caleb: Why not both!
8/19/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: Okay I've been conditioned to type bolth
8/19/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: It's bad
8/19/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Ah
8/19/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Bolth
8/19/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: And idk there‚Äôs kind of a separation for me between someone I know and someone I‚Äôve met
8/19/19, 2:35 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôm very friendly to everyone I meet
8/19/19, 2:35 PM - Marianna: But wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call everyone I‚Äôm friendly to my friend
8/19/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôm watching stranger things
8/19/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: That's totally fair
8/19/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: I think I fall on the other end of that though
8/19/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: I'm more likely to call someone my friend than not
8/19/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: But at the same time I have a small group of "good friends"
8/19/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: Also
8/19/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: Marion is now going to try to get me to take profile pictures for her
8/19/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: I know your pain of having a nice camera now
8/19/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: Hey tell her that‚Äôs my job!!!
8/19/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: Her current profile pictures are Marianna‚Äôs originals
8/19/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: And I can call people my friends but only when I kind of know them
8/19/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: But new people are not friends yet
8/19/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: Totally fair
8/19/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: I suppose my definition is pretty loose
8/19/19, 2:48 PM - Marianna: Also that was a bomb ass chocolate cinnamon thing
8/19/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: And suuuuure I'll let her know you'll take her pictures
8/19/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: I'm sure she'll book you a flight to Copenhagen ASAP
8/19/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah! Can you also send your address as how I'd write mail to it? I don't know how postage works here but by God I'll fry
8/19/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Try
8/19/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  So they told us to get mail sent to AIT
8/19/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send the address give me a minute
8/19/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: I also need yours!

8/19/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: So is your plan to just sorta camp out until more people arrive?
8/19/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: All 56ish people in your program?
8/19/19, 6:02 PM - Marianna: Sorry I‚Äôve been on the phone with Sarah for like 2 hours
8/19/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: But pretty much
8/19/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: And yeah I like how it‚Äôs a kind of small program
8/19/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Okay but I have to cook so I‚Äôm hanging up with her whenever you are free

8/19/19, 8:22 PM - Marianna: Also yeah I really don‚Äôt like being alone in this apartment I can‚Äôt wait for sarah to get here
8/19/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Update now we're all hanging out in our lounge together
8/19/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Also the eggs were good
8/19/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: There's also a berry over here called the lingonberry and it's AMAZING jam
8/19/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Yay!
8/19/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: And yay!
8/19/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: And yay!
8/19/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: What is the berry like?
8/19/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: I think I accidentally just restarted my laundry cycle which means now I have to stay awake LONGER ah :(
8/19/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: :(((
8/19/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: And yeah! I've been talking to our one roommate, Hana
8/19/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: She's SUPER cool, shes psych grad student and is incredibly smart
8/19/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: So we were talking about philosophy and psychology for a whole
8/19/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: While
8/19/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: How many people are your ‚Äúroommates‚Äù?
8/19/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: And DIS has grad students too?  Is she studying abroad or does she go there full time?
8/19/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: Oh and I'm not sure how to describe it
8/19/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: It's just sorta another berry
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Slightly less sweet I guess?
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Okay I have 6 roommates
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: 4 are from DIS
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: 2 are actual Danes
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Or maybe it's 3 and 3
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: But it's really fun getting to know them! We're starting to plan things as a flat
8/19/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: But those sound like very fun after dinner conversations
8/19/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Ah yeah I‚Äôm not sure I could describe a blackberry to someone if they asked
8/19/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: And oh that‚Äôs cool!  It must be kind of nice to have that many people
8/19/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Almost like a pod at davidson
8/19/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I might have to refer to my apartment here as a flat
8/19/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: I feel like that‚Äôs a very European name for it
8/19/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Or well British and they‚Äôre brexit-ing but whatever
8/19/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Okay now I'm at a get together and Sydney Swearington is here
8/19/19, 9:40 PM - Marianna: Woah I didn‚Äôt know she was doing DIS
8/19/19, 9:40 PM - Marianna: I know so much about her from other people but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually spoken to her
8/19/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: Oh maybe except the first weekend when she did the fake tooth trick trying to freak everyone out and I was like uh no she obviously didn‚Äôt just lose her tooth there‚Äôs no blood
8/19/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah I didn't either
8/19/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: She's sort of an oddball
8/19/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: We had Chem 115 together
8/19/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: But anyway
8/19/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Yeah! It's sort of like a pod at Davidson! Except nice, and Scandinavian
8/19/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah oddball is a good way of describing her
8/19/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Is Denmark technically Scandinavia?
8/19/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: I guess I always just considered Scandinavia the three countries above it
8/19/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Oh!  I meant to mention it earlier but my dad has a ton of students at DIS because everyone at Goucher has to study abroad and that‚Äôs a big psych program (as you probably knew or have figured out) so keep an eye out for any Goucher students!
8/19/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: No way! Should I ask if they know your dad if I run into them?
8/19/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Also yep! Denmark is part of Scandinavia
8/19/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Like the southern, kinda sophisticated but kinda redneck part
8/19/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: They're the butt of a lot of Scandinavian jokes
8/19/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Sure!  It‚Äôs a small college so if they‚Äôre psych students, they probably will
8/19/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: He goes by Dr. G on campus though
8/19/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: And woah I kind of love that
8/19/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: The more you know
8/19/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: So like florida?
8/19/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Okay I know your dad owns a consulting firm, but I had no idea what he was in academia
8/19/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: What does he actually do?
8/19/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah! Sorta like Florida!
8/19/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/s-mOy8VUEBk
8/19/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Like watch that
8/19/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: ...no you must be thinking for be other marianna you know
8/19/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Dad just does academia
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: wait WHAT
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk man
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: I swear to God you have a hat
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: ... With goucher on it
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: ... Which is a college
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm genuinely curious where the consulting firm came from
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Oh and I have a Ghirardelli associates hat
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: I think I just inferred that from the hat?
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: THAT'S IT
8/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: THAT'S IT THAT'S IT
8/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Well Ghirardelli associates is my aunt‚Äôs company and she does civil engineering out in the bar area
8/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Bay**
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Okay that's definitely what I was thinking of
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: They had one of the contracts for BART out there
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Super cool stuff
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: How did I know that but not that your dad works in academics
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Because that was something I legitimately did not know
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: But I think she might actually be selling it or trying to get out so she can retire
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Haha you
8/19/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Yup**
8/19/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs be a prof at Goucher for something like 15 years?
8/19/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: And you said Psych?
8/19/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: When he got tenure a while back, I was young enough I didn‚Äôt ever see it spelled, I just heard him talk about it because I used to go into work with him a lot in the summer
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: No way that sounds kinda like me and my dad
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: And after the news came out that he got it, I asked when he would be up for ‚Äútwenty-ure ‚Äú
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Fun fact he also used to be in academia
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Awwwwww
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: That's adorable
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah Joey and I would hang out in his lab and play legos or on the old dells he had in there
8/19/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah at penn right?
8/19/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Nope
8/19/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Penn state Hershey
8/19/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: He hated it though
8/19/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Oh wait that makes sense you went to his office after school
8/19/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Why?
8/19/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: He wanted to interact with actual patients
8/19/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: And they kept loading research into him
8/19/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Also I'm kinda getting bored of this party
8/19/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Would you be up to me going home and calling again? This time with just voice so my phone doesn't go nuclear?
8/19/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Oh those are good reasons to not want to be in academia
8/19/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: And sure!  I‚Äôm lying in bed in the dark so video wouldn‚Äôt do much anyway
8/19/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Ok im heading back now then
8/19/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Back!
8/19/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: And I'm glad the good boi found the bad guys
8/19/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Good on him
8/20/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: Missed voice call
8/20/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: Lesson #12 of languages: never just repeat what someone tells you to say
8/20/19, 12:46 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve called way too many people bitches in Spanish without knowing it
8/20/19, 12:46 AM - Marianna: Because one middle schooler would know the word and be like oh say this!
8/20/19, 12:46 AM - Marianna: But goodnight!
8/20/19, 1:02 AM - Caleb: I don't think I have a clever way of responding to this, my bad
8/20/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: Maybe I should have payed attention to Spanish in second grade ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/20/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: Anyway yep, sorry about that, hope it wasn't awkward
8/20/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: Goodnight!
8/20/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: Oh man do I not want to get out of bed
8/20/19, 10:10 AM - Marianna: But I slept wonderfully which rarely happens in a new place so there‚Äôs that
8/20/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah I'm incredibly cozy too
8/20/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: This blanket is doing wonders
8/20/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: Do you have ac or is it just already cold enough for a blanket up there?
8/20/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: No ac
8/20/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: Like I said
8/20/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: It's just sweater weather here
8/20/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: Okay now hear me out
8/20/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: But also I've been told it's unseasonably cold
8/20/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: I think since you love sweater weather so much
8/20/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: And you want to do all the danish things and embrace being in Denmark
8/20/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: You should just call it danish magic that it is already so nice and cool
8/20/19, 10:24 AM - Marianna: Danish magic weather
8/20/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: It truly is Danish magic
8/20/19, 10:24 AM - Marianna: Some danish wizard was like ah Caleb is coming let me just put together a wee spell and make it welcoming and COLD
8/20/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: And boooooy am I excited
8/20/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: thank u mr danish wizard
8/20/19, 10:24 AM - Marianna: Now don‚Äôt confuse any of this with a MAGIC DANISH
8/20/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: ... Oh?
8/20/19, 10:25 AM - Marianna: those just do funky things to your perceptions when you eat them
8/20/19, 10:25 AM - Marianna: Wizards usually just make them and put them random places I heard
8/20/19, 10:25 AM - Marianna: And watch as the morals are like ‚Äúyo, dude!  It‚Äôs a danish!  In Denmark!‚Äù
8/20/19, 10:25 AM - Marianna: And then make fools of themselves with the side affects
8/20/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: Ah those fools feel victim to the classic Danish blunder! Magic danishes!
8/20/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: Wanna know some real Danish magic though?
8/20/19, 10:26 AM - Marianna: Some say the taste of the danish alone is actually work the psychedelic after effects
8/20/19, 10:26 AM - Marianna: But those people are never the same so do we trust their judgement?
8/20/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: Yeah I think those are actually just called drugs now that I think about it
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs all I got yeah hit me with some danish magic
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: Well Marianna
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: NO ITS A MAGIC DANSIH
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: I had an interesting discovery last night
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: OH OK
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: Sorry sorry
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: don‚Äôt know what the wizards put in it though so maybe
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: Well actually this morning I had the discovery
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: Okay okay go on
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: It's not Amsterdam

8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: ANYWAY
8/20/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: So

8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: I bought some Danish shampoo last night, and it looks totally normal right?
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Well little did I know
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: LITTLE DID I KNOW
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: That SOME Danish companies put dye in their shampoo
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Is it making your hair silver
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Oh dear
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: No
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Better
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Purple?
8/20/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: Purple is generally what blonde hair dye looks like though
8/20/19, 10:29 AM - Caleb: Oh thank God I was scared to look in a mirror
8/20/19, 10:30 AM - Marianna: Pretty sure anyway
8/20/19, 10:30 AM - Caleb: I put it in, started washing it out, and was like "OHHHHHHHH NO"
8/20/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: And that articles says EVERYONE should use purple shampoo
8/20/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: So look at you go
8/20/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre ahead of the trend
8/20/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: YAY
8/20/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: I don't need a repeat of freshman hair
8/20/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: I've had my fill of whacky hair colors
8/20/19, 10:36 AM - Marianna: Oh yes right when you bleached your hair!
8/20/19, 10:36 AM - Marianna: That was hardly whacky
8/20/19, 10:36 AM - Marianna: Unless you dyed the bleached hair?
8/20/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: I will refer to my lawyer for all further questions
8/20/19, 10:39 AM - Marianna: I thought I ate your lawyer
8/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Okay I vaguely remember this
8/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Which means by the law of the land, you're my lawyer or something
8/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: So that's a question only YOU can answer!
8/20/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Ah no I am not licensed to give legal advice
8/20/19, 10:41 AM - Marianna: And law of the land says if your lawyer wants to stop being your lawyer, they are supposed to refer you to another lawyer and not just leave you hanging
8/20/19, 10:41 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm guessing your lawyer did not do that
8/20/19, 10:41 AM - Marianna: So you‚Äôre kind of stuck here and without counsel, have no choice but to answer the question yourself
8/20/19, 10:42 AM - Marianna: (Also I‚Äôm gonna change that so I KNOW your lawyer did not do that because he was not EXPECTING to be eaten)
8/20/19, 10:43 AM - Caleb: You sprung being eaten on him? That's brutal
8/20/19, 10:43 AM - Caleb: He probably wanted to say his goodbyes
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: I had no choice
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: Uhhhhhhuh
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember the context for me eating him
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: Oh hey on a tangential note
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: But I had no choice
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: Danish chocolate milk is delicious
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: Sin/cos
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: Ooooooh that‚Äôs good
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: Wait
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: Hmmm
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: Have you ever seen that picture
8/20/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: What picture
8/20/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: That's like "oh so I went to the beach and got a tan" and it's some girls arm with "sin/cos" written on it
8/20/19, 10:45 AM - Marianna: Yes
8/20/19, 10:45 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs some me level stuff rn
8/20/19, 10:45 AM - Marianna: Right there**
8/20/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: That's basically you
8/20/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: Except you'd also be sunburnt
8/20/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: Hey
8/20/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt been burnt since formal
8/20/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: But oooh that looks good
8/20/19, 10:51 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/20/19, 10:51 AM - Caleb: It's üëåüëåüëåüíØüíØüá©üá∞üá©üá∞üá©üá∞
8/20/19, 10:51 AM - Caleb: Obvi
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: I cringed
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Good
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna make eggs as my breakfast
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: But not yet
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Id be concerned if you didn't cringe at that
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna read in bed for a bit and then get up and be productive
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: That's fair
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: It's only 11
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: You've got PLENTY of time
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: I mean I like my fair share of emojis
8/20/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: But that was too much
8/20/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: 2much4u
8/20/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: 2MUCH4ME!
8/20/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: Yeah I was like "hmmmm maybe this is overkill. Yeah definitely overkill. Sent."
8/20/19, 10:54 AM - Caleb: So ANYWAY asides from being in bed, critiquing my emoji usage, and reading, what's your plan? You want to do anything today?
8/20/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd like to go and get some more groceries but I‚Äôm pretty sure everything will be closed for the holiday
8/20/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: But I have another load of laundry to do
8/20/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: And then will probably just walk around
8/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: And try to find some place to do the fireworks tonight
8/20/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/20/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: I saw this this morning
8/20/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: And apparently it's in Budapest
8/20/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: Fisherman's Bastion?
8/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: YES!
8/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I was there two days ago!
8/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Fisherman bastion!
8/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a killer perspective
8/20/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: I may try to take one like it if I end up going back
8/20/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Like just past the pointy thing in the photo
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Okay
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: How do I get cool abroad pictures
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Hmm what do you mean?
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Because my friends don't know how to take good ones
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Oh haha
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: I can get cool shots as long as I'm taking them
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Hang out with me?
8/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: (Kind of kidding)
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: My mom took that one
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna make Sarah know how to use my camera
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Oof
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Well
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: I'm glad your mom is also good at photography
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: Maybe find someone else who also likes photography?  I‚Äôm sure that there‚Äôs someone
8/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: But I might just end up posting 0 pictures of me unfortunately
8/20/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: Or learn to selfie with a dslr
8/20/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure someone should be able to take your picture places!
8/20/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Oh there's 0 chance I can do that
8/20/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: I'm terrible at selfies
8/20/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Idk how people do them
8/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Step 1: open camera
8/20/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Step 2: flip camera so you can see yourself
8/20/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: (Skip that step of using dslr)
8/20/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Step 3: point camera at self
8/20/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Step 4: smile and click!
8/20/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Okay but sounds fake
8/20/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Also here
8/20/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Since you aren't in the Facebook meme page, I'll just relay them
8/20/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: LOVE THAT
8/20/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: YES PLEASE
8/20/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: I miss it but I don‚Äôt miss the sheer amount of work you know
8/20/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/20/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: But I'm really looking forward to going back next semester
8/20/19, 11:09 AM - Marianna: Yeah me too
8/20/19, 11:09 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna be weird/maybe hard to see people at davidson having fun like on Instagram and Snapchat
8/20/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/20/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: FOMO will start hitting hard
8/20/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: Wait a second
8/20/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: Am I homesick for Davidson
8/20/19, 11:11 AM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôll be more homesick for davidson than Maryland
8/20/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also gonna be weird not seeing my parents and Joey
8/20/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôve always gone home at least once a semester
8/20/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: :(
8/20/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: :((((
8/20/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: I think everything will be better once classes start
8/20/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Also
8/20/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: You'll get pleeeenty of Joey when you're back
8/20/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm lowkey excited to have some structure and something to do
8/20/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: And oh yeah idk how that‚Äôs gonna be
8/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: Well
8/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: I don't think I could have gone to the same place as either of my siblings
8/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: But also eh I did for a bit in high school and it wasn't awful
8/20/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: I just didn't like that it was such a small place that their reputations followed me
8/20/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: For better or for worse
8/20/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm curious how Joey will deal with that
8/20/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: Like he‚Äôll have the same professors
8/20/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: And he‚Äôs not the same kind of students
8/20/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: But I think he‚Äôll like the environment
8/20/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: I hope he doesn‚Äôt hate when I come back
8/20/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Yeah
8/20/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: That's a fair
8/20/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: I think it works better for you guys than it did for me
8/20/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Because I was following not great reputations
8/20/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: And so I kinda got pigeonholed into groups
8/20/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: An some of them were okay
8/20/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: But others were people that I probably should have avoided
8/20/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: What kind of groups did you get pigeonholed into?
8/20/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Oh boy
8/20/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Well
8/20/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Nate wasn't very popular, but he graduated before I was in high school
8/20/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: So I didn't mix with him and his friends a lot
8/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Josh was a bit of a womanizer, and also sort of hung out with people that didn't care a lot
8/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: But they were really really nice people
8/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: And some of them were also really good people
8/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: They just didn't have a whole lot of direction or motivation in their lives
8/20/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: So it was fun to hang around them for a while, but also I shouldn't have been around them too much
8/20/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: They also introduced me to drinking, and a lot of them smoked a lot
8/20/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: But like cigarettes
8/20/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: And one of them was like "hey Caleb, you don't smoke weed. You're gonna help me out, I'm trying to figure out how much tobacco to mix into this spliff so I can smoke it in public without people knowing"
8/20/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: And that was sort of the crowd
8/20/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: And the reputation preceding me
8/20/19, 12:16 PM - Marianna: Yeah I can see how that‚Äôd be hard to break from
8/20/19, 12:16 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve know many people like that in my life
8/20/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: I guess i knew some girls in high school who were more occupied with who they were hooking up with next than doing any school work or anything
8/20/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: But not many people who didn‚Äôt really care about anything
8/20/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: But you liked middle school right?
8/20/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: Do you have any public middle school horror stories?  I feel like people always brag about those
8/20/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: I liked middle school? Oh heeeelllllllllll no
8/20/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Does anyone like middle school?
8/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Someone surprising liked middle school
8/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Oh wait max rollfinke maybe
8/20/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah that sounds about right
8/20/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: I'm sure I have a couple horror stories around
8/20/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Especially since I was perpetually the new kid
8/20/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: OH YEAH I had an arch enemy
8/20/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: In 6th grade
8/20/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: His name was Jack LaChance
8/20/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: OH
8/20/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: as they say in Greece
8/20/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: Grease**
8/20/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Tell me more, tell me more!
8/20/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: Well
8/20/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: First off
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Just look at his name
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: Uh yeah?
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: LaChance
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Say it out loud
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: Yeah?
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: In case you didn't think it was possible for a 6th grader to be a douche
8/20/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: He was
8/20/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: We just to just be antagonistic a lot
8/20/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: There was one time that I think he was poking fun of me because I was taller than him.
8/20/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: And he was like "hows the weather up there"
8/20/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: So I said "Raining" and acted like I was going to spit on him, and then he tried to fight me on the playground
8/20/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Fun times
8/20/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: Lol
8/20/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt even know people flipped the weather height thing for tall people
8/20/19, 12:40 PM - Marianna: You might have kind of deserves the fight if you actually spat on him so I could see why he‚Äôd be upset
8/20/19, 12:40 PM - Marianna: But it was clever
8/20/19, 12:40 PM - Marianna: Have you always been tall?
8/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Not really
8/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: I mean I've never been like SUPER tall
8/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: But I've usually been like 70th-80th percentile
8/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: And yeah wasn't my proudest moment but oh well
8/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: At least I didn't actually spit on him
8/20/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: That would have been a little too much
8/20/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: Oh woah
8/20/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve always been like 5th-15th
8/20/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Yeah but it‚Äôs a bold move even pretending to
8/20/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôm not sure I would have ever had the quick response time to come back with that to his joke
8/20/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: What can I say
8/20/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: I've always been this clever ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/20/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: And I've always overused that emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/20/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: Okay the second text is a lie
8/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: I started doing it like a month ago and I can't stop
8/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: And Marianna! If you sit on my shoulders we can be the 100th percentile!
8/20/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good emoji
8/20/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Not one of my frequent ones but good
8/20/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Yay!  Teamwork!
8/20/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: üíØüíØüíØüíØ
8/20/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: But I think I‚Äôd have to stand on your shoulders if we‚Äôre talking about height
8/20/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm not sure I have the balance for that
8/20/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/20/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: It'd be quite the sight
8/20/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: And you did dance
8/20/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/20/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: It's bound to happen at some point
8/20/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: Oh God
8/20/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: I just ran into Jack Dowell
8/20/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: What is he doing here
8/20/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: Warning I do tend to jump on people and assume they‚Äôll catch me when I‚Äôm drunk
8/20/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: And um he goes there?
8/20/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: Like that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing for abroad
8/20/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: Yeah I figured
8/20/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: I'm just surprised
8/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: His hair is a bunch of new colors
8/20/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah he does seem to like to do that
8/20/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: Really odd kid
8/20/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs 92 here
8/20/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like that
8/20/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs not like I can just stay inside
8/20/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: Especially because my dumb ass opened a window
8/20/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Because it got smoky from frying eggs and I wanted to get that out
8/20/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: ... You fried eggs until they got smokey? Mariannaaaaaaa
8/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: What?  Is that a no no?
8/20/19, 1:52 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/20/19, 1:52 PM - Caleb: Probably not
8/20/19, 1:52 PM - Caleb: I prefer my eggs uncharred
8/20/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: The eggs aren‚Äôt smoky
8/20/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: The air is
8/20/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: The eggs were wonderful is I do say so myself
8/20/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh
8/20/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Well that's unfortunate the air is smokey
8/20/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Did Hungary have a different smell when you got there? Or was it the same because you didn't fly in
8/20/19, 2:29 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think so
8/20/19, 2:29 PM - Marianna: Did Copenhagen?
8/20/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: You know I don't think so either
8/20/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Maybe a little cleaner considering I was coming from Philly
8/20/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: But it was also late
8/20/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: This place doesn't smell too distinct
8/20/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Which is probably good and bad
8/20/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: So how's your independence day going?
8/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt left my apartment yet
8/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: I keep wanting to but I don‚Äôt know what to do
8/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: I know I‚Äôm gonna try to go out to see the fireworks on the bridge tonight
8/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm using that as an excuse so I can stay inside and read
8/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: And I started looking at Sarah and my fall break trip
8/20/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: Ooooooo that's a lot of fun
8/20/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: I just got out of a talk about food and cooking
8/20/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: So I'm pumped
8/20/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: OH that sounds fun
8/20/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: My kindle says I‚Äôm 80% done my book so maybe when I finish I‚Äôll go outside
8/20/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs so gosh darn hot
8/20/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: So maybe I‚Äôll turn on Netflix instead
8/20/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: Which book? I haven't had much time to read
8/20/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: And gosh darn that IS hot
8/20/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: Still watching stranger things
8/20/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: The two Lila Bennett‚Äôs
8/20/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the same story line of a criminal defense attorney but with two different variations but through both, she goes and apologizes to everyone she‚Äôs wronged and has a change of heart and all the bad stuff comes out
8/20/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Very interesting
8/20/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôm one variation, she‚Äôs been kidnapped and forced to write letters or things to people to say sorry and the other one, she avoids the kidnapping by making one little different choice but then still ends up having to apologize to the same people
8/20/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: But yes, stranger things
8/20/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Have you seen the third season why?
8/20/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Yet?
8/20/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Nope! Sorry I'm lame
8/20/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: I don't watch a whole lot of Netflix
8/20/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: And that sounds like a really interesting book
8/20/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Ive got to pick a good next one
8/20/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: I think I might have it though
8/20/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: It's called "Roadside Picnic"
8/20/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: I've wanted to read it for a long while
8/20/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: But I could never find it
8/20/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: And now I have it on kindle! I just need some free time to read
8/20/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs it about?
8/20/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: So
8/20/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: It's loosely inspired by Chernobyl
8/20/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: But it's this event called "the visitation" where the plant goes to shambles
8/20/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: And there are these weird zones called "visitation zones"
8/20/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: And they have these strange phenomenona that happen in them that no one understands
8/20/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: But there's this group of people called "stalkers" that their job is to basically escort people into the zone
8/20/19, 4:27 PM - Caleb: And they hunt these things called anomalies
8/20/19, 4:27 PM - Caleb: But anyway, there's this room that will grant your deepest desire in the zone, and a stalker gets hired to escort a group into the zone to find it
8/20/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: I think
8/20/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds really interesting
8/20/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Is it future world but still on earth or no?
8/20/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Yep! It's on earth
8/20/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: It's a Russian novel that got translated a while ago
8/20/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: But usually Russian novels translate pretty well I think
8/20/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: There's not a whole lot of nuance lost
8/20/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: Oh that makes sense why it was hard to find then
8/20/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: Question
8/20/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Am I sitting in bed eating tortilla chips while watch I get yet another episode of stranger things even though I keep telling myself I‚Äôll leave and explore this new city of mine?
8/20/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Yes...
8/20/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/20/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: The question
8/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: Is rosemary an acceptable substitute for tarragon
8/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: Also that's fine! Explore more when people are there!
8/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: It'll be more fun and less dangerous with friends
8/20/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: And then you all can explore it all for the first time together!
8/20/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: Yes for some things
8/20/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: Tarragon is more of a soft leaf
8/20/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: Rosemary isn‚Äôt as soft
8/20/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs what I keep telling myself
8/20/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: But episode just ended so I may go walk for a little bit
8/20/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: If you do, send lots of pictures
8/20/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: You doubt me
8/20/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: Have you still not been able to find tarragon?
8/20/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Nah they had a shelf for it but coriander was stocked instead
8/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: In my experience that doesn‚Äôt happen I frequently
8/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: They don‚Äôt always have a ton of each herb
8/20/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: I think they were just out
8/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: And because those have to look fresh and nice, sometimes they just run out
8/20/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: I even asked an old Danish lady who looked like she knew her herbs
8/20/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Awww
8/20/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think rosemary cream chicken would be bad
8/20/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: You might just need to crush the rosemary or use more because it‚Äôs a little subtler of a flavor
8/20/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm going exploring so you may not hear from me for a bit
8/20/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Well keep updated on where you are so I know you aren't dead!
8/20/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: That'd be kinda uncool if you died before your program started
8/20/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not dead
8/20/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Had a nice little walkabout
8/20/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Want to hear about it?
8/20/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Absolutely
8/20/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Not
8/20/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Absolutely not
8/20/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: :(
8/20/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Jk jk tell me all about it!
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: :(
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: What did you see!
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Well now maybe I won‚Äôt
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Actually I will because I really want to tell someone
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: SO I set out walking towards st Stevens church
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Because today is st Stevens tay
8/20/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Day**
8/20/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the national holiday
8/20/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Just like ah maybe there‚Äôll be something going on
8/20/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: And there was a mass going on outside!
8/20/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Pretty singing
8/20/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Wish I‚Äôd known and maybe I‚Äôd have gone
8/20/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt want to invade and gawk
8/20/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: And then I walked a little farther
8/20/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: And found a little courtyard to sit in
8/20/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: And wrote some more in my travel journal
8/20/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôm like days behind
8/20/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very bad at actually keeping up journaling
8/20/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: One reason I like photos!
8/20/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Pictures and a thousand words and all that
8/20/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: And then I heard singing and I got up and there was a little parade of what had to be parishes or some group going to the church
8/20/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: And then I walked back and as I passed, there were three shop keepers at a little food place just CRACKING up because one of them had exploded like whipped cream or something in their face
8/20/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Hello!
8/20/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Sorry my phone died and then I had a flat meeting
8/20/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Do you have any pictures? That sounds like a very eventful walkb
8/20/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: I cooked dinner with 3 people from my flat and BOY was it good
8/20/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Lots of fun too
8/20/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Cooking is a great bonding experience
8/20/19, 8:40 PM - Caleb: And also, I didn't know you kept a travel journal
8/20/19, 8:40 PM - Caleb: I know you keep a like one-sentence-a-day one, but I didn't know you kept one for travel
8/20/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: How long have you had that? Any notable entries?
8/20/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Some on my camera but I haven‚Äôt gotten them off yet
8/20/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you cooked with people!
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Well have you heard of moleskin notebooks?
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I love them
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I always get one as my planner
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: But they are a Milano company
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: So I bought a new one in Milan this trip
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Just for my abroad adventures
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Because I left the one a day at home :(
8/20/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Semi consciously because it was kind of thick and this one is nice and thin
8/20/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: ALSO
8/20/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: How busy are you right now?
8/20/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: From 1 (marianna please call and tell me about the rest of your day) to 10 (just text me and I will read it when I can because I‚Äôm hanging with people or doing something rn)
8/20/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Or if you‚Äôd rather I can just text it as well
8/20/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: I'd love to hear about the rest of your day!
8/20/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: It's American night at a local bar
8/20/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: So a bunch of Danes and Americans get free/cheap drinks
8/20/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: But other than that I'm not doing much
8/20/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Ive got a little time
8/20/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And I want to be in bed before things start tomorrow
8/20/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Is American night like a normal thing
8/20/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Or do they just know a bunch of American students just came in?
8/20/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: Oh they tooooooooootally know a bunch of US kids just showed up
8/20/19, 10:48 PM - Marianna: Clever Danes
8/20/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
8/20/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Those clever, clever Danes
8/20/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Getting all my money
8/20/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Also, I've realized I'm the most sober one here
8/20/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: So guess who's group dad!
8/20/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Your dad powers are leveling up
8/20/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Your now an INTERNATIONAL dad
8/20/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Okay it‚Äôs sleep time for marianna
8/20/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Goodnight and have fun being the dad friend or not but just have fun!!
8/20/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: INTERNATIONAL DAD
8/20/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: I'll take it
8/20/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Best award I've ever gotten
8/20/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: We're at a club now
8/20/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: It isn't very pubby
8/20/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: And I'm wearing like a sweatshirt and comfy pants
8/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Christ there are so many Davidson people here it's basically f
8/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: But also actually fun
8/21/19, 12:49 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/21/19, 12:49 AM - Caleb: And with that, I'm back in bed
8/21/19, 12:50 AM - Caleb: Goodnight!
8/21/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: How was the club/party/ bar??
8/21/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: I saw on Marion‚Äôs story she was with a ton of girls at what looked to be a club
8/21/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: I also like the comic
8/21/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: Ah!  Classes today!
8/21/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: I woke up at like 3 and could not fall back asleep so I don‚Äôt feel great this morning
8/21/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Ooooooo things starting todaaaay
8/21/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: For both of us
8/21/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Exciting!
8/21/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: And I'm sorry, that's never fun :(
8/21/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: You think you were nervous?
8/21/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: Oh and the club/party/bar was fun
8/21/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: I wasn't a fan of a lot of the locals actually
8/21/19, 9:46 AM - Caleb: Because they seemed to pick up on the fact that a lot of college age American students are coming into town, so a couple of them were just kinda sleezy
8/21/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: Yeah I think so
8/21/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm here on campus?
8/21/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: !**
8/21/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: Is been good so far
8/21/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Oh no bad locals
8/21/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs no fun
8/21/19, 11:13 AM - Marianna: They‚Äôve so far been telling us about cultural things
8/21/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: Yay for being on campus!
8/21/19, 11:14 AM - Caleb: Anything giving you culture shock so far?
8/21/19, 11:15 AM - Marianna: Not really
8/21/19, 11:15 AM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs mostly general European stuff
8/21/19, 11:15 AM - Marianna: Some special thing
8/21/19, 11:16 AM - Marianna: Things**
8/21/19, 11:16 AM - Marianna: Like apparently it is only polite to give an odd number of flowers?
8/21/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the only thing that has seemed really strange so far
8/21/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Ah so a dozen roses is DEFINITELY out
8/21/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Sorry Sharifa
8/21/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: That's pretty nice that the transition will be so smooth though
8/21/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: There's such a lack of culture shock here that I'm kinda sad
8/21/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Like, there are little things like mannerisms and wearing shoes in a room, but it's so western it's almost indistinguishable
8/21/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah sharifa thats a no go in Hungary
8/21/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Wearing shoes in a room?
8/21/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/21/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: We made marshmallow towers!
8/21/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: It was a pretty fun orientation, all things considered
8/21/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Definitely didn't need to be 2 hours
8/21/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: But actually fun
8/21/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Our professor is SUPER nice
8/21/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: He's 29 and a PhD student finishing his thesis
8/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Wow that‚Äôs such an orientation activity
8/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: We haven‚Äôt done that
8/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: And woah that‚Äôs such a young professor
8/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Is he just one of your professors or?
8/21/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: He's just the one for the main class
8/21/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: But it's amazing, it's like he's so relatable and actually understands student life
8/21/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: And even like our generations inside jokes
8/21/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: His name is Ulf
8/21/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: OH and also I'm amazed at who's in my class
8/21/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: It's like a 50/50 split of guys and girls
8/21/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: And only one of them seemed kinda awkward
8/21/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: But he was included anyway
8/21/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: And they all seem really cool, which I hate to admit wasn't what I was expecting
8/21/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: I was totally expecting like a billion guys who can't talk to other people
8/21/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: WHAT THE FUCK
8/21/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
8/21/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: YOU KNOW HOW I WAS SAYING THAT I HAD LIKE TWO CHURCH FRIENDS WHO WANTED TO GET ENGAGED
8/21/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/21/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: I found eduroam in the middle of the city
8/21/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs so cool
8/21/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve met sooooo many people today!
8/21/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: One girl love key reminds me of Sydney
8/21/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: And we‚Äôve been hanging with both AIT and Budapest school of mathematics
8/21/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Yay! I wanna hear all about it
8/21/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: I'll have to ask my friend what her boyfriends name is
8/21/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Maybe you know him now
8/21/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve loved some of the nerdy conversations I‚Äôve had so far
8/21/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Sorry I was on a bus so I lost the WiFi
8/21/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Mid conversation
8/21/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Not many of mine seem traditionally cool but some seem nerdy cool which I‚Äôm good with
8/21/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: And OH GOODNESS WELL IM HAPPY FOR THEM BUT AHHHHHH WHAT THE HECK
8/21/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: I think this is how my 25 year old cousin feels
8/21/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Like she‚Äôs going to so many weddings
8/21/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs got med school so she don‚Äôt got time for that
8/21/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: But yeah, send his name when you get a chance!
8/21/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Haha no worries, I figured you're still setting up data/SIM cards and whatnot
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah still don‚Äôt have a SIM card
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Figured I‚Äôd go tomorrow morning
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Yeaaaah you've got time I think
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Because I just got back to my apartment
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: It's not a big deal if you're consistently around internet
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt have class until 11 am tomorrow
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: It just makes wandering around a little more risky
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah yeah
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Niiiiiiice
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: I thought about that
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: I wanna hear about your friends!
8/21/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Like if I‚Äôm lost or get in trouble I‚Äôm not in great shape
8/21/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's understandable
8/21/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Oh also
8/21/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: ```Caleb Grenko
Room 32, 1-1
Nimbusparken 32
2000 Frederiksberg
Denmark
```
8/21/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: That should do it
8/21/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: Maaaaaybe add ```Nimbus Kollegium``` on a new line before "Room 32"
8/21/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Got it!
8/21/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Should you get any postcards, you should read them in the order listed above the first line of the body
8/21/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: If by chance that is
8/21/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Ooooo
8/21/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Now I'm curious
8/21/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Anyway!  New friends!
8/21/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: There are too many to count
8/21/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: (I‚Äôm just that popular)
8/21/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: But two girls who is guess I‚Äôm gonna end up hanging out with are rose and robin
8/21/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre roommates and they also have a third roommate
8/21/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Seemed really cool
8/21/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: And the group of guys I hung out with last night at the fireworks too
8/21/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Some of them are really nerdy and it‚Äôs so fun and their names are jamba, Hans, and the last one I can‚Äôt spell but it kind of sounds like Aaron but also aemon so I don‚Äôt know
8/21/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Oh it‚Äôs aurnov
8/21/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: But I talked to a lot of people and I love just being able to be like hi I‚Äôm marianna tell me your life story
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Woah
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: That's quite the assortment
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Okay Marianna
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Give me your name
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Your major
8/21/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: What are the odds that using packing tape to hang pictures wrecks the wall?
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Where you're from
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: And a fun fact about yourself
8/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: And depends
8/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: How is the wall painted
8/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Wallpaper? Concrete?
8/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Because if it's anything other than a solid material, packing tape will deeeestroy it
8/21/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Paint
8/21/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: For the wall
8/21/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: You...you just said my name
8/21/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: So I don‚Äôt need to say it
8/21/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: But there‚Äôs also like a wood side of the room that I may try to just put stuff up there
8/21/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: But I like my photos above my bed where they always are
8/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: ALSO SO APPARENTLY ONE OF MARIONS COPENHAGEN FRIENDS IS HOOKING UP WITH THIS KID HERE THAT I MET YESTERDAY
8/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: such a small world
8/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Marion really does make connections by divulging people‚Äôs hookups though
8/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: This is definitely a matter
8/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Pattern**
8/21/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah just get some painters tape
8/21/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: You can find it everywhere, and it's designed to not rip off paint or wallpaper
8/21/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: And whaaaaat that's wild
8/21/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: Ok im trying to wrap my brain around the Marion thing
8/21/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: So her friend is in Budapest and is hooking up with a Budapest guy?
8/21/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: Or he's from Budapest?
8/21/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOD IS HIS NAME VICTOR
8/21/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: No
8/21/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: Her friend is in Copenhagen
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: Basically opposite of us
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs here
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs there
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: I guess she also goes to Pomona and they were hooking up before abroad?
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: Not entirely sure but she said ‚Äúthe guy my friend from here is hooking up with‚Äù
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: That's wild
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Very wild
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Maybe we can visit Copenhagen together
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Oooo
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Sounds fun
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: I've heard it's a lovely city
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: I hear it‚Äôs got lovely people
8/21/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Also how you doing?
8/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Both marion and Margaux are having a little bit of a rough time rn
8/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: And I want to make sure it‚Äôs not a universal Copenhagen thing
8/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Maybe it‚Äôs not a lovely city
8/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Maybe it‚Äôs a dreary city
8/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Oh!  And do your classes start tomorrow?
8/21/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: I'm good! It's been a fun day
8/21/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: I'm glad things are starting to pick up
8/21/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: I really like my professor, and I like the kids in my class
8/21/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: I think it's just a lot less wondrous than people were expecting
8/21/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: And now I'm settling in and watching bachelor's in paradise with some friends
8/21/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: Class starts at 1 tomorrow
8/21/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: Idk, I think I'm just missing the people from Davidson
8/21/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: I miss my friends, but don't want it to stop me from making new ones
8/21/19, 8:56 PM - Caleb: Also, something about me is that I adjust very easily
8/21/19, 8:56 PM - Caleb: I guess it's the result of moving around so much
8/21/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: What are they feeling right now?
8/21/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs good!  Tell me about your friends or classmates!
8/21/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: Also please don‚Äôt become someone who watches the bachelor
8/21/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure I can deal with that
8/21/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: Tbh I don‚Äôt adjust very easily
8/21/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: Like I fake it till I make it
8/21/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: But change is hard on me
8/21/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: Because I kind of tend to have doubts if I can do it
8/21/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: I also don‚Äôt think living alone is good for me
8/21/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: Gives me too much time that I don‚Äôt have human contact and lets my brain think too much
8/21/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: Marion‚Äôs having boy issues because he‚Äôs a dumb ass but has every right and reason to have his reservations about what they‚Äôre doing rn
8/21/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: And Margaux is homesick and feels like she‚Äôs missing out on all the kids living in dorms
8/21/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: So maybe be glad you‚Äôre not in a homestay because I don‚Äôt know how much exposure to the other kids she has or how much she can hang out with them
8/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: I've got a sort of an eclectic group of friends
8/21/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: A lot of them are from the US
8/21/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Most of them are from the US actually
8/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Okay sorry
8/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Back
8/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: They were trying to get me to get it up
8/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Because they couldn't get the US access and ya boy has a VPN
8/21/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: Oh christ this is terrible
8/21/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: So so terrible
8/21/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: But so so good
8/21/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: Anyway
8/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Who's Margaux's boy? I don't think I've heard anything about this
8/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: But I totally get if you don't want to say
8/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry she's having a hard time though
8/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh wait I misread, Marion's boy
8/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I'm still sorry about that
8/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: That can't be fun
8/21/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: I'll invite Margaux out this weekend if you think that'll help
8/21/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: I can imagine that she feels like she's missing out a little hit
8/21/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: And honestly she probably is a little bit
8/21/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: But I'll try to include her this weekend
8/21/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: How are you doing? If transition is hard for you, I'd imagine this is a pretty big one
8/21/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: What are you feeling right now?
8/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: She might like that!  You really don‚Äôt have to but if you and your friends want another person to hang, she might want to
8/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Just if you go out, watch out for her?
8/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre v protective of her
8/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Or well I am
8/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt say I said anything
8/21/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Ok I won't
8/21/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: What does she like to do?
8/21/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Is she a partier?
8/21/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôd probably be down to go out
8/21/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs also probably be good hanging with people at the dorms too
8/21/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Or doing cool stuff in cope
8/21/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: Oh also I‚Äôm feeling okay
8/21/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: I want to hang with people a little more
8/21/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt want to invite people over because I don‚Äôt know these people and don‚Äôt necessarily trust people with my place yet you know
8/21/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking maybe seeing if people want to go to a ruin bar tomorrow or Friday night
8/21/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Ok, well if she's around I'll see if she wants to tag along and make some friends
8/21/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Also Marianna I'm not gonna lie this show is hilarious
8/21/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: It's funny watching with Danes and then having all the girls explain the plot to them
8/21/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Haha
8/21/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Sorry to say this to you
8/21/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: But we need to watch an episode
8/21/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Is paradise the one where past contenders are on an island together?
8/21/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: No
8/21/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: It's apparently good background noise though, so maybe we'll find something to do while it's on
8/21/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/21/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: Oh you you you
8/21/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: And yeeeeeeep that's the one
8/21/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: And there‚Äôs the emoji!
8/21/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: It's the "shrugging jokingly but implying implications" emoji
8/21/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: It's a good one
8/21/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: You do that a lot in person too I feel like
8/21/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Hey I'd say it's worked out so far
8/21/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/21/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Hey hey hey don‚Äôt overuse your signature move
8/21/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
8/21/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: I'd risk losing my charm
8/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: But what if that's not my signature move? Aha
8/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Also okay I think I've figured out why the girls like this so much
8/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: First, it's absolutely rediculous
8/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And actually hilarious how awful it is
8/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And it's honestly fun because I'm with a group that is just relentlessly making fun of it
8/21/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: But second
8/21/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Everyone is SO AWFUL at relationships, they enjoy being like "YOU NEED TO LEAVE HIM" or "YOU NEED TO PICK ONE" or some variant
8/21/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: And it's like a lobbed ball for relationship advice
8/21/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: It's so easy to feel like a guru
8/21/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Wait what then would you consider your signature move?
8/21/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Yeah no the people on it need some self respect or something
8/21/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Grace always joked I‚Äôd make a great bachelorette
8/21/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: But I feel like I have better thangs to do with my life
8/21/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: Although I‚Äôm watching gossip girl and it‚Äôs also trash
8/21/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: But 2000s trash
8/21/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: I take it back this show has some hilariously wonderful moments
8/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: My signature move is something I don't think I can answer
8/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: I've been told I have a couple of them
8/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: "don't worry about it" is definitely one of them
8/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: But also a borderline defense mechanism so idk if it counts
8/21/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Which ones do you think I have?
8/21/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Shrugging is definitely one
8/21/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Also I don't think I've ever seen Gossip Giro
8/21/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Girl
8/21/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Gossip girl
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Oh now I‚Äôm curious have you pulled any of these so called signature moves on me?
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: Well
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Idk idk
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: Define signature move
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just use
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just you**
8/21/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs your signature move
8/21/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it
8/21/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: But I needed something not scary to watch before bed
8/21/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Hmm
8/21/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Well
8/21/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: I've definitely pulled them on you then
8/21/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: Because I'd say I'm remarkably me around you
8/21/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: And totally understandable
8/21/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Haha I‚Äôm glad
8/21/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Wouldn‚Äôt want you any other way
8/21/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Oh no chaos just erupted in the show
8/21/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Chaos?
8/21/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: What's up?
8/21/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Cheating best friends
8/21/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Just wandering into each other
8/21/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: THERES SO MUCH DRAMA
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh IN the show
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: yes
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: No god not in real life
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: I thought Budapest friends
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: And was like
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Bruh
8/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: That was fast
8/21/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: There's lots of cheating in this show too
8/21/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: It's very very entertaining but also I feel kinda bad for some of them
8/21/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Haha that would be phenomenal
8/21/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Oh no shot is HITTING THE FAN
8/21/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: I feel bad for these characters too
8/21/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Some people are wildly mean
8/21/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna eat some potato chips and it will all be better
8/21/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Hungarian potato chips make everything better
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Actually they‚Äôre tortilla chips
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: And weirdly good
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Oh well that's not okay
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Everything's ruined!
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like potato chips
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Unless you have sauce
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Only tortilla
8/21/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: No
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: :(
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: The only potato chips I like are the baked ones
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: No sauce is fine
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Those are quuaaaaaaality
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: ... Just like straight up potato chips?
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Nope only tortilla
8/21/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: TORTILLA
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Tooooortilla
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: My bad
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Jet lag
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Or something
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: come on dude
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Get with the program
8/21/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Oh how is the jet lag?
8/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Oh it's totally fine
8/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I was good on the second or third day
8/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I'm just a doofus
8/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: And I like having an excuse to be a dufus
8/21/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt need no excuse to be a dufus
8/21/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: Although I think doofus is not spelled dufus
8/21/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Well I'm glad to hear that
8/21/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Because in a month or so I think people will stop buying that it's jetlag...
8/21/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Uh then you can blame school
8/21/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: And stress
8/21/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Always works
8/21/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Nah thats lame, I should probably just embrace it
8/21/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs also expected
8/21/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/21/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Well
8/21/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Glad to hear I have a doofus pass
8/21/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
8/21/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: There are limits
8/21/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Bear that in mind
8/21/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Oh lord I'm not sure how to interpret that but now I'm nervous
8/21/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: I swear I'm a harmless doofus
8/21/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Haha I don‚Äôt know aht it was supposed to be but it‚Äôs not supposed to be nervous invoking
8/21/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: I believe you‚Äôre a harmless doofus
8/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good thing to be
8/21/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Thaaaaaaaank goodness
8/21/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: I think I play it off most the time anyway
8/21/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Like, our building keeper was walking out with a couple people at 3pm today, and I walked by him and said "Good morning!"
8/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: And he was like "Morning? It's well into the afternoon!"
8/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: And I was like "ahahaha time flies when you're in class I guess!"
8/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: And the moment still haunts me
8/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Haha
8/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a good one
8/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs true
8/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Today flew for me
8/21/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: I was like WHAT it‚Äôs 6pm?
8/21/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/21/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Eventful day I guess
8/21/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: I still honestly keep getting distracted by my friends getting engaged
8/21/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: And then classes, cooking, and bachelor in paradise
8/21/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: And just homework
8/21/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: I forgot that's a thing
8/21/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Oh I don‚Äôt want to think of homework yet
8/21/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: We literally only learned the letters of the alphabet
8/21/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: And only SOME of them
8/21/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs a ton
8/21/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: We all had dinner as a group through the school
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Oh! Did I tell you I met someone from Budapest today? He's in my class, his name is Victor
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: So I didn‚Äôt have to cook tonight
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Awwwwww
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: Oh cool!!!
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: FRIENDSHIP
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: Well it was kind of not optional
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: (mandatory) FRIENDSHIP
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Still counts
8/21/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: Forced interaction is still good
8/21/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Like you said
8/21/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: A surprising amount of people are very social
8/21/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Oh? Were you expecting a bunch of socially awkward CS kids?
8/21/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Yes!
8/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Well
8/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: I'll be honest
8/21/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: And there are some socially awkward
8/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: I don't think socially awkward CS kids would be willing to move to a foreign country for 4 months
8/21/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: It's somewhat self selecting
8/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: But honestly the cs kids are less socially awkward than the math kids
8/21/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: And I'm not just saying that for the alliteration
8/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: Some look and act like textbook math nerds
8/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a good point
8/21/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: But sarah is a little bit socially awkward
8/21/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: But I guess I‚Äôm her safety blanket
8/21/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Not a bad role for me I got to say
8/21/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Heeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy look at us
8/21/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Being the social ones for others to mooch off of
8/21/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: It's fun
8/21/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: And reassuring because it also means you'll always have a friend
8/21/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: Yeah but the others I‚Äôve met seem pretty social
8/21/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: I hope sarah doesn‚Äôt get scared by the social ness
8/21/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôll like the neediness though
8/21/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: I know!  I can‚Äôt wait for her to get here and like spent literally 24/7 with her!
8/21/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: Remind me when she gets there?
8/21/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: September 3
8/21/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: SARAH JUST MADE TWO PLAYLISTS FOR US
8/21/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: ONE NAMED BUDA THATS CHILL AND TOWNLIKE (I told her it was more chill over there) FOR STUDYING
8/21/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: AND ONE NAMED PEST THATS FOR PARTIES
8/21/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so great
8/21/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Update the cheating best friends are making up
8/21/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: AWWWWWW YEAH
8/21/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: That's a good way to get hype
8/21/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: You guys are gonna have such a great time
8/21/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: I hope they don't work you too hard at AIT
8/21/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: (and also you get a break to come say hi)
8/21/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: But idk if Budapest is ready for yall
8/21/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: And also I'm glad they're making up, but also sorta sounds toxic so idk
8/21/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: IM SO PUMPED
8/21/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: I hope they don‚Äôt work us too hard either
8/21/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve been saying this city ain‚Äôt ready for us for like months
8/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Although if you asked me a few months ago, I‚Äôd probably have pictured myself ready and preparing for a little bit wilder of a semester but I‚Äôm gonna try to behave
8/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: But sarah and I always have a good time I can‚Äôt wait to party with her
8/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Also study with her
8/21/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: But sometimes we‚Äôre not the most productive together
8/21/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs fine
8/21/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: From what I‚Äôve heard, this semester should be manageable work load wise
8/21/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah no again the characters are the worst
8/21/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve never come across these people in real life
8/21/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Pssh well suit yourself
8/21/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna go WILD in copenhagen and become a Danish legend
8/21/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: You'll hear stories of me from locals
8/21/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: It'll be great
8/21/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: I'll do some real viking stuff or something
8/21/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Okay that was all a joke but actually it did remind me of an actual viking thing
8/21/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: For the Nordic Mythology class, I get to sail a replica viking ship
8/21/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Also
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: My flat wants to take a trip to Gothenburg
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: To go to this one amusement park
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Or at least Hana and Emil do
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: It's my job to convince the others
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Oh! And apparently I am pretty decent at having a Danish accent
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll one up you then and became a budapest legend
8/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Actually I don‚Äôt want that for myself
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Which is somewhere between flattering because it's cool, and insulting becauss it's an awful sound
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Apparently this city parties until 6am
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs so cool about the ship and also the accent
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Half of language is just imitating
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Sorry that was a lot of tangentially related thoughts thrown together
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Okay so how are you planning on convincing them
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking either PowerPoint
8/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Or brandy
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Do Danes drink brandy?
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay that‚Äôs lowkey how my brain works
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: I was just gonna go "hey you guys wanna go to a famous Scandinavian amusement park in a city four hours away" and hope they say yes
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Lame
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: But whatever
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: FINE geez
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: (Kidding I support you)
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: I'll do interpritave dance
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: And hope they understand
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Me: **gives you support**
8/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Oh god
8/21/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Me: **takes away support**

8/21/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: ```beep boop```
8/21/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: We have a sandwich making contest towards the end of language thing where we have to use our Hungarian at the market and then make a sandwich

8/21/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: Idk

8/22/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: Happy Thursday
8/22/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: I think you're just feeling a little antsy without anyone around
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: I don't think antsy is the right word
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: But still you know what I mean
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Easily entertained when given attention
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: You or me?
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Me
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Maybe you
8/22/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Maybe?

8/22/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: I think my thumb is getting carpal tunnel
8/22/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Carpal thummel?
8/22/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Fun fact, when I was a freshman in high school, did that to my friend Erin, but it was so long that her phone kept crashing
8/22/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: So she had to get her mom's phone and text me from there, just so that she could tell me I'm an asshole
8/22/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: OH I HAD FRIENDS DO THAT TO ME

8/22/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: And Joey knew them
8/22/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: It was probably from his phone to mine
8/22/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs a dipshit!
8/22/19, 12:07 AM - Caleb: You're telling me you got harassed by your little brother's friends
8/22/19, 12:07 AM - Caleb: Wow you have a new favorite word don't you
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: And did I just get equated with your brother
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: No stop
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt do that anymore
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: And yes
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: It happened more often than not
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: But grace and I also tortured him
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: But he likes grace too
8/22/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: But we‚Äôd ask him about GIRLS
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: and he‚Äôd be like ew cookies
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: Cooties**
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôd never say ew cookies
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: I'd hope not
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Cookies are prime
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Also yeah ew girls
8/22/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Definition of gross

8/22/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Me!
8/22/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Actually idk I burp a lot
8/22/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Apparently that‚Äôs gross to some people
8/22/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Hmmmm what about you
8/22/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Besides quality burps
8/22/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Which I honestly don't mind by the way

8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Hungarian is messing with my brain
8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: Tzar Marianna
8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: A leader we can all get behind
8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Is that me when I drink vodka
8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd captain marianna is rum
8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: If**
8/22/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: Well
8/22/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: I've never seen you drink vodka
8/22/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: So I'll let you know
8/22/19, 12:14 AM - Marianna: Oh dear
8/22/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre in for a treat
8/22/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm actually serious I actually behave with vodka
8/22/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Daily reminder you haven't seen me drunk
8/22/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs led me to just some good nights
8/22/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: YOU'RE in for a treat
8/22/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Yay!
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: I mean wine in philly?
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Frolics?
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: I was tipsy at most
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: Frolics too
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll take that
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: That wine was not very strong
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: I've got a fairly high tolerance
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: No no it wasn't
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: I should have been much drunker
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: It was a good level though
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Like a warm comfy level
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: Oh don't get me wrong
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: I had lots of fun in Philly
8/22/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: :)))
8/22/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Yay
8/22/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Me too
8/22/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Good way to end the summer
8/22/19, 12:17 AM - Caleb: It certainly was
8/22/19, 12:17 AM - Caleb: So
8/22/19, 12:18 AM - Caleb: How do I get Sarah to not hog you for an entire semester
8/22/19, 12:18 AM - Caleb: That's the question
8/22/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: She won‚Äôt
8/22/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: We got to plan stuff though
8/22/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: I kind of have the weekends with Sarah already blocked off
8/22/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Any other one, I‚Äôm good
8/22/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a weird convo planning trips to see each other though idk maybe that‚Äôs just me
8/22/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Well I definitely want to travel anyway
8/22/19, 12:20 AM - Caleb: And it seems like we've been pretty successful at exploring cities together
8/22/19, 12:20 AM - Caleb: So I figured if there was somewhere in between, plane tickets are cheap
8/22/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: That is a very good point
8/22/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: Both are
8/22/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: Bolth
8/22/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: ;)
8/22/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: I always would like to see Copenhagen
8/22/19, 12:22 AM - Marianna: But it seems inconvenient that they don‚Äôt let people sleep over
8/22/19, 12:22 AM - Marianna: I was lowkey worried that would be in MY lease
8/22/19, 12:22 AM - Caleb: Yeah

8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: First off
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: That's the song
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: ...or do?
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: Too bad
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: :(
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll listen to it
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: It's not that good
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: But it's to such an iconic movie that I don't care
8/22/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/oKNy-MWjkcU
8/22/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Just watch that instead
8/22/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôve never seen the movie
8/22/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Went to the rusk sisterhood though does that count
8/22/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: No
8/22/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: And going to the sisterhood doesn't count if you haven't seen the movie
8/22/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: But anyway it's the highlight of Michael Jordan's film career, and also Bugs Bunny's
8/22/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: It was my least favorite of all the sosternhoods
8/22/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: But when we got back to watts afterward, the guys had all gone to ihop and had pancakes for us
8/22/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: So the night wasn‚Äôt a total loss
8/22/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: DAMN that's a good night
8/22/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: Only a little jealous
8/22/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: IHOP is a total move
8/22/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: I've had many many hungover Sundays at IHOP
8/22/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: Pancakes fix all
8/22/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never gone there are a normal time
8/22/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôve done dinner
8/22/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: But never breakfast
8/22/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: Usually because my mantra is commons brunch fixes all
8/22/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Both are good mantras
8/22/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Oh man
8/22/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Know what I'm excited for when I get back to campus?
8/22/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Those cinnamon rolls
8/22/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh lord those sweet sweet artery clogging cinnamon rolls
8/22/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Oh wait a second
8/22/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Important question
8/22/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: What's potato cubes, coins, or hashbrowns
8/22/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: What's your pick
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: Oh the cinnamon rolls are good
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: I can only ever take like a bit ethough
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll miss the scoopie most
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: And coins
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt ever get them for myself
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: I only ever steal them off of other people splayed
8/22/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: Peoples plates**
8/22/19, 10:30 AM - Marianna: Idk why but that‚Äôs the only way I can eat them
8/22/19, 10:31 AM - Caleb: Coins are acceptable I guess
8/22/19, 10:31 AM - Caleb: And yeah I always have to split a cinnamon roll with someone
8/22/19, 10:31 AM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your take?
8/22/19, 10:31 AM - Caleb: Because if I eat the whole thing, I know 0 work will be done and I'll just want to nap
8/22/19, 10:32 AM - Caleb: Ooo my take?
8/22/19, 10:32 AM - Caleb: Cubes
8/22/19, 10:32 AM - Caleb: Coins are just too fried for me
8/22/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Okay well this is no longer compatible the
8/22/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to steal YOUR coins
8/22/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Cubes are too dense for me I feel like coins are lighter
8/22/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: Cubes are too dense? YOU'RE too dense! IT'S OVER!!
8/22/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: Honestly fried potatoes in general are kinda overrated
8/22/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: They just make me feel not great afterwards
8/22/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: Oh boo
8/22/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: I think they‚Äôre stellar
8/22/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: But you are entirely to your own potato pinion
8/22/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: Opinion**
8/22/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: Nope sorry your opinion is wrong
8/22/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: That's how it goes in this potato fight
8/22/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: Also, ya boy is gonna shave soon
8/22/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: And idk if I should do it now and let people meet me with a naked face
8/22/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: Or if I should let people get used to it, then ditch it and see how many people do double takes
8/22/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: Because I remember when it was like the second week of school, and I shaved and put on glasses
8/22/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: And some of my residents reintroduced themselves to me
8/22/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: And that was hilarious
8/22/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Update your opinion about this no longer matters
8/22/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: What is done is done

8/22/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: Oh I shaved the rest of it don't worry
8/22/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: I lowkey liked it
8/22/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: But also I'm not going to the first classes like that
8/22/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Too bold

8/22/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: Okay
8/22/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: I can share my google doc...
8/22/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: But you have to promise to use it wisely and can‚Äôt share with others
8/22/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: I mean I remember that you said you did freshmen year and it was a little awkward because you didn‚Äôt know many people
8/22/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

8/22/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: I'd imagine if you use the language, the letter will follow
8/22/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: So the language
8/22/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: I mean I hope to use it a lot
8/22/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: I feel very rude coming into a country and expecting them to speak MY language
8/22/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Meanwhile, in the us people speak perfect English but get yelled at for not even expecting others to speak their other language but just for using any other language
8/22/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: The world does not revolve around Americans and I want to seem like I know that
8/22/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: So like wherever I go, I try to learn at least a few words beforehand such as pleasantries
8/22/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Well
8/22/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: That's a great idea
8/22/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: I think I may give my best shot at Danish
8/22/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Mostly for the same reasons
8/22/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: And partly because if I do, I'll be passable as a Dane
8/22/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: But also this shit is REALLY HARD
8/22/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: I don't even know how the Danes understand each other
8/22/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Which reminds me of that video
8/22/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/1139699/the-languages-that-take-the-most-and-least-time-to-learn-per-the-us-foreign-service/amp/
8/22/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/ykj3Kpm3O0g
8/22/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: I mean I don‚Äôt think everyone sees it as rude it‚Äôs just a personal thing
8/22/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: I just also feel bad making people switch over
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: OKAY THAT VIDEO IS SO FUNNY
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: They do it so easily
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: But also if they approach me in Danish I don't want to look like a deer in the headlights
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah I can see how that would be hard
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: And I KNOW
8/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: It's SO ACCURATE
8/22/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Today, we were waiting for a bus and a lady just spoke Hungarian at us
8/22/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: And I was like k√∂zs√∂n√∂m!
8/22/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: (Which means thank you)
8/22/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: And walked towards where she had been pointing
8/22/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: Because I figured she was telling us the bus was going to pull up behind the broken bus we were standing next too
8/22/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: Yay! Do you think you fit in fairly well?
8/22/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: That's such an exciting moment
8/22/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Idk
8/22/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: I have andi so I doubt it
8/22/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how exactly to fit in yet
8/22/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: Was told today that Hungarians don‚Äôt smile at random people
8/22/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: And like if you do, you get looked at funny
8/22/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: And they know you‚Äôre a foreigner
8/22/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: Most likely American
8/22/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Hey
8/22/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: If that's the price for smiling at people
8/22/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: I'll take it
8/22/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Really
8/22/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not gonna smile at people
8/22/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Well I will at people I know and like
8/22/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: But not strangers
8/22/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Did you do that before?
8/22/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Or are you an anti-smiling at strangers person in general
8/22/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: No I smile at anyone
8/22/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a smiler
8/22/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: And a laugher
8/22/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve laughed so much with meeting new people
8/22/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I genuinely don‚Äôt think I did it enough this summer
8/22/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: Like at work I did a little but not like side splitting and certainly not at my apartment
8/22/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I did when I went home
8/22/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: My family and I do funny very well together because we all have the same sense of humor except Joey but he‚Äôs funny to us but we‚Äôre not funny to him
8/22/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs one of the best things about being a Ghirardelli (close and extended) I think
8/22/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: AWWWWWWWW
8/22/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Im glad you laugh a lot
8/22/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: You've got a quality one
8/22/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Family and laugh
8/22/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Thats such a good quality to have
8/22/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Being willing and loving to laugh
8/22/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Ha I really don‚Äôt think I have that quality of a laugh
8/22/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Like I don‚Äôt really even know what my laugh sounds like I couldn‚Äôt fake it
8/22/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: But no it‚Äôs the best feeling to laugh
8/22/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Definitely one of my favorites
8/22/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Okay I do still want to hear about your day
8/22/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: But I need to sleep
8/22/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: So feel free to text me and I‚Äôll read them when I wake up!
8/22/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
8/22/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Aha
8/22/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: I was actually just about to send that I need to go to bed too
8/22/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: I need to be up at 7
8/22/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: NEVERMIND BECAUSE HE'S DOING HIS DISSERATION SO CLASS IS CANCELLED FOR A WEEK
8/22/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: ... Which I'm honestly kinda sad about
8/22/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: I was really looking forward to this one
8/22/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: And well I think you have a quality laugh
8/22/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: You've got a laugh that shares the joy
8/22/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: When I hear you laugh, I can't help but laugh myself
8/22/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: But I'm not sure if that's your laugh, or just you
8/22/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: And my day was pretty decent
8/22/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: First day of classes
8/22/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: I did homework for Friday in the morning, sat and ate breakfast
8/22/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: And then had a class at 1, which was kinda chaotic because there was construction so I couldn't get to the room directly
8/22/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: So I had to go through a maze of stairwells and hallways to get to it
8/22/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Not fun, especially since they were freshly painted so I was fighting the fumes
8/22/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: But I got to class, it was okay, then I went to a cafe with some friends for about the next hour until Hannah and I went to our next class
8/22/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: It was complexity of cancer
8/22/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: The professor brought cake! AND THEN I WON AT KAHOOT!
8/22/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: I won a bag of liquorish, but it's Danish, so it was SUPER salty
8/22/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: And the whole class watched me struggle to eat one
8/22/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: It was pretty funny
8/22/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: But then I went back, relaxed for a bit, made dinner for some people, they did dishes and I started homework
8/22/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: And I finished a little bit aho
8/22/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Okay I think I'm gonna go to bed too now
8/22/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: Class at 10 and whatnot
8/22/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: But hey! It's Friday (by the time you read this)
8/22/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
8/23/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: Which classes have you already had/which was the one that got cancelled?
8/23/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: And let me get this straight you chose early classes during your abroad semester aren‚Äôt you like not supposed to do that
8/23/19, 8:16 AM - Marianna: Well in the past you‚Äôve made me laugh a lot so you‚Äôll probably get to hear it again
8/23/19, 8:16 AM - Marianna: Oh we got so lost walking to AIT on Wednesday
8/23/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs in a giant business/tech park outside of the city so we had to take a train and then walk from there and there were no signs so we just wandered
8/23/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: CONGRATS ON KAHOOT
8/23/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: And for trying new local sweets
8/23/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs Friday!  I have two classes, a trip to the mall to get my SIM card (can I text your de number when I get it?), and then Wien tasting tonight
8/23/19, 8:51 AM - Caleb: My Artificial Neural Networks one
8/23/19, 8:51 AM - Caleb: Which is my 8:30
8/23/19, 8:51 AM - Caleb: And I'm kinda bummed because it seemed like a fun class
8/23/19, 8:51 AM - Caleb: But it'll be back so ehh
8/23/19, 8:51 AM - Caleb: Also yeaaaaaaah I guess you can text me again...
8/23/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: Seriously though I don't really enjoy using whatsapp that much
8/23/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: I don't like read receipts
8/23/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: It puts waaaaaay too much pressure on texting
8/23/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: And wine tasting! That'll be so much fun! There's a club like that here, and I'm debating joining
8/23/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: Oh that does sound cool
8/23/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: Couldn‚Äôt tell you what you‚Äôll learn in it
8/23/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: But sounds cool
8/23/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: :)
8/23/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt have to pay attention to the read receipt
8/23/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt hold it against you I promise
8/23/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: Okay
8/23/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: Now I'm in my class on the History of Copenhagen
8/23/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: And it's been an eternity since I've been in a very specialized non-stem class
8/23/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: Its definitely a different crowd
8/23/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: Class is starting in a few minutes
8/23/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: But I'm like "YOU'RE NOT MY PEOPLE", but they're all nice and cool so I'll live
8/23/19, 10:42 AM - Marianna: Haha I‚Äôm in the language class but we‚Äôre all comp sci people and it SHOWS
8/23/19, 10:43 AM - Marianna: like yesterday, we were supposed to come up with random 3 digit numbers and quiz our partners and the guy I was working with and I came up with the EXACT SAME NUMBER and it was both of our FOURTH numbers in the list of random
8/23/19, 10:43 AM - Marianna: So we were like whoa
8/23/19, 10:44 AM - Marianna: And calculated the probability that that would happen
8/23/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: Let me know how the class goes!  That still seems cool
8/23/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Haaaaaaaaa
8/23/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: You comp sci people
8/23/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: And it wasn't as jarring as I thought
8/23/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: It was just funny because everyone was like "oh hahaha I'm not a history major, I'm actually (insert other social science)"
8/23/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Ans then I was like "bioinformatics"
8/23/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Which was just a curveball but still the class shouldn't be brutal
8/23/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Just not quite what I'm used to
8/23/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Lots of writing
8/23/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Oh! And can you send me your mailing address again? I can't find it
8/23/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Also my friend's boyfriend's name is Max
8/23/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: The one is Budapest
8/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: I thought dis was mostly science program?
8/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: Also what‚Äôs Reid‚Äôs major?
8/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: Also bioinformatics is just a curveball anywhere someone at davidson just made it up
8/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: (Mostly kidding)
8/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: I will have to find it again but yes I can send it to you again
8/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: And is he doing bsm or AIT?
8/23/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: Also!  Got my SIM card but I‚Äôm still waiting for at&t to unlock my phone. But even when that happens, I‚Äôve paid for data on the phone but texting and calling still costs like per message and we send each other a lot of messages so instead of telling you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt text‚Äù can we just keep WhatsApp-I guess?
8/23/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: I promise I don‚Äôt care about the read receipts I get we both have stuff to do in our own country
8/23/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Oh no it's totally basically just a made up major
8/23/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: DIS is a lot of different things
8/23/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: It's not really one program, or one focus
8/23/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: And Reid is an econ major
8/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: He's doing BSM, I just figured you knew a few people in that program
8/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Also yeah! Whatsapp is totally fine if thats what works best for you
8/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: I didn't realize you had to pay by the text
8/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Data and texting is STUPIDLY cheap here
8/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: For like $15 a month you can get 100 GB data and unlimited texting
8/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: But I'm paying about $6 for 4 GB and still unlimited texting
8/23/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs cool that there‚Äôs a lot of different people
8/23/19, 3:09 PM - Marianna: But on the flip side I kind of enjoy everyone is a comp sci person I am with
8/23/19, 3:09 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like $16 for 5GB but that doesn‚Äôt include any talk or text
8/23/19, 3:09 PM - Marianna: But woah yours is crazy
8/23/19, 3:11 PM - Marianna: How has your day been so far!
8/23/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: My days been good!
8/23/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: I just got back a bit ago
8/23/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Now I'm cooking with Reid and our flatmate Hana
8/23/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: We've got such a cute flat man
8/23/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: We all come back and ask each other how each other's days were
8/23/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: And they're friendly and social and hang out in the kitchen while people are cooking
8/23/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt it early to be cooking?
8/23/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so cute
8/23/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: You deserved a good roommate break
8/23/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: also now I‚Äôm gonna nap because I woke up early and have wine tasting in like 3 hours
8/23/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
8/23/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: It's not too early to be cooking if I haven't eaten since 8
8/23/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: But yes! I'm glad I have good roommates too
8/23/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: And goodnight/afternoon! I'll let you sleep then
8/23/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Ok I took the BDSM quiz again with my apartment
8/23/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: We're getting to know each other reeeaaaaalll well
8/23/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Oh yes eat then!
8/23/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Uuuugh I shouldn‚Äôt have napped because now I have to get up and shower and clean my kitchen
8/23/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: But I want to stay in bed
8/23/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: AH!  They know but I don‚Äôt!
8/23/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: :(
8/23/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs so fun
8/23/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Best taken as a group
8/23/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Actually as a group and drunk
8/23/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how I took mine
8/23/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll get sarah to do it she wasn‚Äôt there last time and I‚Äôm curious
8/23/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Okay I'll definitely tell you
8/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: But in person
8/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: It'll definitely be an in person thing
8/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Also I'm considering a nap right now too
8/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: I don't want to do much
8/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: And I'm sleepy
8/23/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah! Speaking of lists, can you send me that Google doc you were telling me about? Of your favorite recipes?
8/23/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Yes I think I‚Äôd like to hear about it in person too
8/23/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Nap! Nap! Nap!
8/23/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah give me a minute!
8/23/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: It should go to your school email
8/23/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh it is 87 out
8/23/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Too hot
8/23/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs too hot in my apartment too
8/23/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt like this
8/23/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Got it! Wow it's quite extensive
8/23/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Lots of good ones in here
8/23/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: I should probably ask my mom for some of hers, she's got looooads of good Dutch recipes
8/23/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: And would you say... Too hot? Hot damn
8/23/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: It's toasty here too
8/23/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: ... Aaaaand it's 76
8/23/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Anyway
8/23/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: I'll take your advice
8/23/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Thicc nap here I come
8/23/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Oh wait! How was your day?
8/23/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah man
8/23/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôll probably add some Hungarian or just other recipe that‚Äôs I find this semester
8/23/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Oh that is not toasty
8/23/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what it was this morning and it felt wonderful
8/23/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: My day was good!
8/23/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: It doesn‚Äôt feel like Friday
8/23/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: Update dishes are not getting done I don‚Äôt want to do them but idk if I‚Äôll want to do them after wine tasting
8/23/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Update from Denmark
8/23/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Nap was üëåüëåüëåüëå
8/23/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Have you ever powernapped so hard that you wake up with drool on your chin and think it's the next morning
8/23/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: Oh I am soooo happy to hear that
8/23/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: I wish I had had you for my nap
8/23/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: Wasn‚Äôt the best nap in the world
8/23/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: And now the back of my head hurts and I have no idea why
8/23/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: And no I don‚Äôt drool I‚Äôm a princess
8/23/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve definitely been like wHaT TiMe Is it
8/23/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: Well
8/23/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: I wish you had me for a nap too :)
8/23/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: Also
8/23/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: I've just been sitting on my bed for like 4 minutes now just trying to wake up enough
8/23/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: And idk about the drool thing
8/23/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: It sounds to me like your naps just haven't been good enough
8/23/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: What time is your wine tasting?
8/23/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Oh I also don‚Äôt like waking up like that
8/23/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: I like waking up and either falling back asleep or being able to get up immediately not any in between
8/23/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: PRIN
8/23/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: CEDS
8/23/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: CESS**
8/23/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Oh darn that wasn‚Äôt as powerful as it was supposed to be
8/23/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm leaving my place in like 2 min

8/23/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: So I couldn't taste the vodka
8/23/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Which is good and bad
8/23/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: And you can imagine why
8/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not trying to be confusing I promise!
8/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I also enjoy being hella flirty but I like it in person so much better which is why I‚Äôm like AH MARIANNA SAY THIS but sober marianna would think it‚Äôs too bold over text
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll take it into consideration and try to be bold
8/23/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: The one thing I can promise is when I see you it will be fun

8/24/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: My body just isn't happy with me for the 1am Borgor King
8/24/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: What about you?
8/24/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Ohhhh bad borgor king
8/24/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Wait was it really spelled like that?
8/24/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good I was shocked when I looked at my phone and it said 11am but then again I did stay up until 2
8/24/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Although that phone call felt like 2 minutes but it was like an hour
8/24/19, 11:33 AM - Marianna: But now I‚Äôm in the mood for some commons brunch ;(
8/24/19, 11:33 AM - Marianna: :(
8/24/19, 11:40 AM - Marianna: Update my phone unlock got denied so now I‚Äôm gonna have to call customer service and ask why and for them to pretty please unlock it it‚Äôs for my safety
8/24/19, 11:40 AM - Marianna: Also the error message of why they didn‚Äôt unlock it isn‚Äôt true so I‚Äôm hoping talking with someone will work
8/24/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: First off no it's just what our drunk asses decided to loudly call it
8/24/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: So now long live borgor king
8/24/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: I think I got up around 9
8/24/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: My body doesn't like me sleeping past then
8/24/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: And it doesn't really matter how late I stay up
8/24/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: And MONS
8/24/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: :(
8/24/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: I'd kill for ANY form of mons potato
8/24/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: OR THE PARFAIT BAR
8/24/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: Even if Will is working
8/24/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: And ooooooo that's not fun
8/24/19, 11:46 AM - Caleb: You have Verizon? I've heard they're real hard asses, but you should be able to negotiate with them if you're like "PLEASE I'LL DIE OTHERWISE"
8/24/19, 11:46 AM - Caleb: Usually that's a pretty good excuse
8/24/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Okay I support borgor kind then
8/24/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: But booo for getting up early
8/24/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Oh the parfait bar would be so nice rn
8/24/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Is the will the kind of middle aged guy who comes off military?  No one seems to like him but I think he‚Äôs always very nice
8/24/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: And no AT&T
8/24/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Alright here's the bit
8/24/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Yeah that's will
8/24/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: He's very nice, but only sometimes
8/24/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: And it's always SUPER formal
8/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Never let's down the wall
8/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Even if he's talking about his kids or something
8/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: And then the next day he'll act like you've never talked
8/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: He's very flip flop
8/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: My favorite is Bobby
8/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: The Filipino guy with the tattoos, he's really nice
8/24/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: You see I just see that as military
8/24/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I do too
8/24/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: But I don't want to be served by military
8/24/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been around those kind of adults more often than normal
8/24/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mind
8/24/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: I also don‚Äôt talk a lot with them and never really get their names
8/24/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: There is one guy I‚Äôd always talk football with when I wore my eagles jersey to commons
8/24/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Ah yeah that makes sense then
8/24/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: I always chat them up a little bit
8/24/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: It just makes everyone's day better
8/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: I guess I‚Äôd rather just get my food and go and they‚Äôre never cold to me but it‚Äôs a little pleasantries and then I get my food and go I don‚Äôt really linger to talk
8/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Maybe I should
8/24/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Working in the service industry is so boring and awful that someone just treating you like a real person fan make their day
8/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: That does seem the polite thing to do
8/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Well I hope I‚Äôm still treating them like a real person I just don‚Äôt always ask about their life story
8/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Ah what‚Äôs the word I‚Äôm looking for
8/24/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: You have a proclivity for asking people about their life story
8/24/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: You would have like the bus driver going to warner formal this year
8/24/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: Eh I don't ask for their life story
8/24/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I just try to interact with them
8/24/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: Break the script
8/24/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Oh? The bus driver?
8/24/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: I RAN back to new dorm at the last minute to drop off andiamo and so James and I were the last few to get on the bus and there were no seats left so while Owen bezick offered either Sarah and I could sit on his lap and the other could sit next to him, we opted just to stand but the bus driver called us up and we sat up with him
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: So I literally sat on the like engine of the bus the whole way but we just talked with him about his life and stuff
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: UhhhhhhhhhhhhokayOwen
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah got to love Owen bezick
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: See! Thats fun! You can meet so many interesting people
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Pretty sure sarah did end up in his lap that bus ride
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Or certainly the ride home
8/24/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Not a fan of him
8/24/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah it was fun
8/24/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: Not what I expected to be doing on the way to warner formal but good times
8/24/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: Well you know what they say
8/24/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: WaPpA HaPpA
8/24/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: That is what we say yes
8/24/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: Good saying
8/24/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: Not really sure it applies here
8/24/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: Oh man I am thirsty
8/24/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: And hungry
8/24/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: buT I STiLl DIdNT Do dISHeS SO I haVE TO dO theM Now
8/24/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Chug some wooter
8/24/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: And ooo that's rough about the dishes
8/24/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: Hungover dishes is literally cleaning up last night's mistakes
8/24/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: A good time for reflection
8/24/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: Also go out and get some cheap Hungarian breakfast
8/24/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: Nah I want to cook
8/24/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: I may get a coffee from downstairs though that sounds like a good idea
8/24/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah I know all about hungover dishes we had house cleanup at warner Sunday mornings
8/24/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: They were always like we don‚Äôt care how you show up but you have to show up
8/24/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: And some people definitely came in clothes from the night before
8/24/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: Marion never went
8/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: I routinely went with my makeup from the night before
8/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm absolutely awful at taking it off at night
8/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: Whoops
8/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: Although in defense of rn I don‚Äôt have any makeup remover
8/24/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: Ah I have a bruise on my knee so I‚Äôm really fitting into the stereotype that drunk girls just get bruises and don‚Äôt every know where they came from
8/24/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: Lovely
8/24/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: Fun Danish fact
8/24/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: 7/11 is MASSIVE here
8/24/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: And they're really nice
8/24/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Like, I'm eating fresh focaccia with cheese and sauce
8/24/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: And it's delicious
8/24/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: It's no local Hungarian coffee shop
8/24/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: But it'll do for now
8/24/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Also, sounds right for Marion
8/24/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: On brand
8/24/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: And not having makeup remover sounds bad for your skin
8/24/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: But I don't wear makeup (gasp) so idk
8/24/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Also yeah I always wondered why drunk girls always have brusies all over their legs
8/24/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: I feel like I just don't bruise easily in general
8/24/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: Oooooh I haven‚Äôt seen any focaccia here
8/24/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll make some
8/24/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Well the coffee shop below me we think is run by Australia ex pats
8/24/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Yeah it won‚Äôt be great but I‚Äôm planning on running to the drug store around the corner today for a few things
8/24/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: And if it makes you feel better we have no idea either
8/24/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: My legs usually don‚Äôt bruise easily
8/24/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôm usually not one of the guys who is like what is this
8/24/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Actually I am but it‚Äôs almost exclusively cuts not bruises that I can‚Äôt explain
8/24/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Also quirky thing about Hungary is I could only find brown eggs
8/24/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: BrOwN EgGs? ChOcoLAtE???
8/24/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Also that's super cool
8/24/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: About the aussie coffee shop owners
8/24/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Australia seems really cool
8/24/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Except for the middle of it
8/24/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: And everything that can kill you
8/24/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Because that's most of Australian wildlife
8/24/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Yeah?  Like the shell cover is brown
8/24/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Not CHOCOLATE Caleb
8/24/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm surprised
8/24/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: I thought you were the egg expert
8/24/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think I‚Äôd like to visit Australia when it‚Äôs colder in the northern hemisphere
8/24/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: I mean I may ever try surfing if I made it out there
8/24/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: That seems like the thing to do
8/24/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: But yeah Australia can kill anyone pretty easily
8/24/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: But mArIaNnA!
8/24/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Brown milk is chocolate milk, thus brown eggs are chocolate eggs
8/24/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: It's irrefutable
8/24/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: That's just how the world works
8/24/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: And re: the Australia thing
8/24/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: My friends keep sending pictures of New Zealand
8/24/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: And I'm starting to get a lil jealous
8/24/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I feel cooped up in a city
8/24/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I need to leave and see some mountains
8/24/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Denmark is too flat though, so I need to travel a bit for them
8/24/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: It's just sorta confirming for me that I could never settle down in a big city without a car
8/24/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: I love the city, but need breaks from it all
8/24/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: But CaLEB
8/24/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: No
8/24/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Doesn‚Äôt work like that
8/24/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: I kind of feel cooped up here to
8/24/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: Too**
8/24/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: But buda has a few hills
8/24/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: But I want to travel to see the different sights and landscapes of Europe
8/24/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's fair
8/24/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: The only issue is moooooooney
8/24/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: I'm wondering if I should just get Olof and Anna to take me places
8/24/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Hiking in northern Sweden sounds fun
8/24/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: It's probably gorgeous
8/24/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: So, you got any plans for the day?
8/24/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Oh that doesn‚Äôt sound like a half bad idea
8/24/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking walking and trying to get a yoga pass
8/24/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want to leave my bed!
8/24/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: Yes I just had breakfast
8/24/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm thinking about eating some ice cream
8/24/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: For sure actually
8/24/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: What about you?
8/24/19, 1:58 PM - Marianna: I feel like I can‚Äôt really go off and adventure without a working phone
8/24/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Well
8/24/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: There's currently a festival called Culturehavn
8/24/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: And I'm at a farmers market
8/24/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: And it's super fun
8/24/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: I'll send pictures when I have internet
8/24/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Ohh there‚Äôs a farmers market tomorrow at szimpla (yes it‚Äôs a bar at night and a market on Sunday)
8/24/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs called szimpla Kert which means garden and it‚Äôs basically a ruined hollowed our building with trees and plants all over the place in the
8/24/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: In the center**
8/24/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: Idk if I already described it to you last night
8/24/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna try to go to that tomorrow I think
8/24/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Wooo! Farmers markets!
8/24/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: They're like my guilty pleasure
8/24/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: That's so much fun
8/24/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: If you do, grab some pictures for me so I have a better visual
8/24/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Because I'm imagining like an old underground bar with ancient stone, and a tree in the middle bathed in a skylight
8/24/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Which sounds hella cool
8/24/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Well I cannot eat much at them
8/24/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not far off?
8/24/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: It feels very underground
8/24/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: But with TONS of people
8/24/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: :(
8/24/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: There's lots of edible things for you here
8/24/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: I got ice cream
8/24/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: And fresh bread
8/24/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Oi I fucking love fresh bread
8/24/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: It was still warm
8/24/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: AND HAD HONEY!
8/24/19, 2:55 PM - Caleb: FRESH HONEY!
8/24/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Ohhhhhh
8/24/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre TORTURING me Caleb
8/24/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/24/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: This place is really cool
8/24/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: It's an old shipping yard
8/24/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: But the shipping containers are all converted
8/24/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: And they have glass blowing and other stuff
8/24/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: And all sorts of ethnic foods
8/24/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: And now I'm in an old boat hanger, which is a restaurant
8/24/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: So ima get a cool beer because it's a T O A S T Y day
8/24/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: I know how you love a good glass blowing shop in an old shipping container
8/24/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs sounds like you have found all sorts of cool places
8/24/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll get up and leave my apartment
8/24/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: I gotta say
8/24/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Leaving your apartment is highly recommended
8/24/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Do you have a balcony or any way to get sunshine in your apartment?
8/24/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: You should sit outside, soak up the sun, and sip some coffee
8/24/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Read that sentence aloud, it's a fun one
8/24/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: But!  I scared
8/24/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs so hot outside
8/24/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: And you‚Äôll hate me but yeah I have three big windows
8/24/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: But they have blinds on them
8/24/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: Because if I open them my apartment just COOKES
8/24/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: I may do the coffee thing though
8/24/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: I read that as cookies
8/24/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: And got excited
8/24/19, 3:52 PM - Marianna: Nope
8/24/19, 3:52 PM - Marianna: No cookies
8/24/19, 3:52 PM - Marianna: Although I do want to pick up some chocolate at the store
8/24/19, 3:52 PM - Marianna: And I finished my bag of chips so I need more chips too
8/24/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Treat yoself
8/24/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Get some cookies
8/24/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: And that's good you have the big windows! Bathe in the sun!
8/24/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: I've got my own big windows so I'm not even jealous
8/24/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Caleb Caleb no
8/24/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Too hot
8/24/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: They need to stay closed
8/24/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: That almost autocorrected to clothed
8/24/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Scandalous windows
8/24/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: :o
8/24/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: :[
8/24/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think I remember from the FaceTime that you have a giant window right next to your bed yeah?
8/24/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: Yep! You got it
8/24/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: And it's only a _little_ blinding in the morning
8/24/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: I can sleep in pretty much any light as long as it‚Äôs a constant light
8/24/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: But like if people are opening and closing doors it doesn‚Äôt do good for me
8/24/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: And then I get gwumpy
8/24/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Also!  New plan is my phone should be unlocked in an hour and then I‚Äôll put the new SIM card in and then I‚Äôll go run errands
8/24/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: Heeyyyyy good! I'm glad you cracked some skulls over at AT&T
8/24/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: Now you can explore, so the city is yours
8/24/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Yup
8/24/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Although I may have to erase my phone
8/24/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Which would only be the second most stressful thing I‚Äôve ever done
8/24/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Update my back is SPASMIng
8/24/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: :(
8/24/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: You shouldn't have to erase your phone
8/24/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Just pop the new Sim in and restart
8/24/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: And booooo, no back spasms
8/24/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: I should probably back my phone up though
8/24/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Just in case
8/24/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: I really wouldn‚Äôt want to lose stuff
8/24/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: My phone went to sleep and didn‚Äôt wake up senior year of high school

8/24/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Ooooo losing all your phone stuff is not fun
8/24/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: I would know

8/24/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Hello new number!
8/24/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Do yourself a favor
8/24/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Turn off the wifi on your phone and test the data whole still in your apartment
8/24/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: DONT LOSE MY SIM CARD

8/24/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Hooray! All good then
8/24/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: I made that mistake
8/24/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: I didn't try data out, left with some friends, and got 0 messages
8/24/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Oh right because you put your SIM card in your microphone if I recall
8/24/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Kidding
8/24/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Why didn‚Äôt yours work?
8/24/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: It had no data on it
8/24/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: Waddyaknow
8/24/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: And no no I didn't

8/24/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: They really did
8/24/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: You can't just sweep that under the rug
8/24/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Have you seen the warner bros caveat they put before the old cartoons explaining how it was from another time?

8/24/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhaaaaaa
8/24/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Admittedly I guess it was just my whack mind that saw the yolo
8/24/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Maybe IM too 2015
8/24/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: üò±
8/24/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: ohhhhhh noooo
8/24/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: What other notable things happened in 2015
8/24/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: I feel like it was a bland year
8/24/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Sort of the red-headed step child of the 2010s
8/24/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Except for 2011 maybe
8/24/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: What do you have against red heads
8/24/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: I feel like they‚Äôre never the blank ones
8/24/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: Nothing
8/24/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: My dad is a redhead
8/24/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: Well
8/24/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: When he had hair
8/24/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Yes yes I remember you saying that
8/24/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: What colors are your brothers hair again?  I feel like you‚Äôve talked about one or both of them dying their hair so I don‚Äôt remember
8/24/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: Josh has silver/dark gray hair
8/24/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: Nate is a deep brown
8/24/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: Well
8/24/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: Dark brown at the roots, but he has really strong blond highlights
8/24/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: Naturally
8/24/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: Wait what silver hair
8/24/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/24/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: He has green eyes and dark silver/gray hair
8/24/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: Sounds like a character out of a fairy tale
8/24/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: That's what the girls thought in high school
8/24/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: Oh no I‚Äôm looking for nail polish and I cannot choose colors
8/24/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: Any advice?
8/24/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: And BOY oh boy it got to his head
8/24/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
8/24/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: He's chilled though
8/24/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: Right yes you‚Äôve said
8/24/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah it was a tough reputation to follow
8/24/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: What color palettes do we have
8/24/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: So many
8/24/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: Actually not a lot of blue
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: But I usually do black on my toes and some either really pale or really vibrant on my fingers
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Hmmmm
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: HMMMMM
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Yellow
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: A pastel yellow
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: Ew
8/24/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: What
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: HAHAHA HA TOTALLY KIDDING
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: Psshhhhhh
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Actually they don‚Äôt really have that
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: They have gold
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Well I just don‚Äôt wear any yellow
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not my color
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: Well it can complement red well
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: Or blue
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Not objectionable in the abstract
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: BUT
8/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: I guess
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Uhhh
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: They have a kind of cool really dark red that‚Äôs sparkly almost black
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Well red
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Oh hey look at that
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: Or just a plain red
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Candy apple red is too read
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: Or I was looking at the gold but those always take so many coats to put on
8/24/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: Okay
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Too red
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Whoops
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Is there like a scarlet?
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Oh there‚Äôs one called back to the fuchsia
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Ha
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: This is a 180
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: But what about powder blue
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even know what scarlet looks like
8/24/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: And no not many blues
8/24/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs mostly warm
8/24/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: Like red/pink across the spectrum
8/24/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Oh right you mentioned that
8/24/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: I have a powder blue at home I like though
8/24/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Do a scarlet if there is one
8/24/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: What's the base for a lot of fingernail polish
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: What
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: What do you mean
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: Is it like a water base
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: What do they put the pigment in
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: I never had sisters
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: I have no idea
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: And my mom definitely doesn't wear it
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: Joey used to paint his nails with my nail polish
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: And he was awful so he‚Äôd get it all over the carpet
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: ... Huh
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: Judy was never happy
8/24/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: How recently?
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Not recently at all
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh that makes more sense
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Although he‚Äôs let people completely makeup his face this year
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send the picture if I can find it
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: I was thinking that didn't sound very Joey
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: OOO
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: I've been there once
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Wasn't a good night though
8/24/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: I was very drunk, and having a rough time because I got shot down for an internship s
8/24/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: So the makeup started running
8/24/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: OH I FOUND SPARKLY BLACK
8/24/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: that‚Äôs toes for sure
8/24/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm actually going powder blue because it‚Äôs even paler than the one I have at home
8/24/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Ooooooo
8/24/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Sounds bold
8/24/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Pale blue is always a nice color
8/24/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Used to be my favorite
8/24/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Then I saw the light
8/24/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: ...orange
8/24/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: Orange ya glad I didn't say banana
8/24/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: Which you're allergic to
8/24/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: So I was right
8/24/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: Yes
8/24/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: Although you did suggest yellow earlier
8/24/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: So I would have bought banana
8/24/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: So what have you been up to today?
8/24/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: I most certainly did not suggest yellow
8/24/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: It was unrelated to favorite color
8/24/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Because I'm unbiased, or something
8/24/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: And right now I'm grocery shopping
8/24/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Earlier I got my permanent resident card
8/24/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: And then we went to the farmers market and the festival
8/24/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Also GUESS WHAT
8/24/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Oh pick up cookies
8/24/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Yay!  Congrats on being a permanent resident of Denmark!
8/24/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: WHAT
8/24/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I CANT WAIT TO HERE
8/24/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: HEAR
8/24/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: BECAUSE WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY USUALLY MAKES ME HAPPY
8/24/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/24/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: I'm about to be a proud dad of a  basil plant
8/24/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: What have you been up to?
8/24/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: OH I NEED TO GET ONE
8/24/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: BUT I COULDNT FIND ANY HERBS AT ALL
8/24/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: what‚Äôs his name gonna be
8/24/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: And not much
8/24/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Did run and get some things I needed
8/24/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Bradley
8/24/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Bradley P. Basil
8/24/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Hey that sounds like a productive day
8/24/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: I need to get a gym membership
8/24/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Because otherwise W H E W I'm gonna get some chonk with all these Danish treats
8/24/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Bradley!  Love it
8/24/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: I would like to meet Bradley at some point
8/24/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Lol I‚Äôm in that exact same boat
8/24/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: For now:gelato
8/24/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: For later: yoga passes
8/24/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/24/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: Bradley's new home is a broken candle holder
8/24/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: And yes! I'm sure Bradley would be happy to meet you sometime
8/24/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: He's very kind
8/24/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: As long as you don't eat him
8/24/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Like my lawyer
8/24/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Which I still don't know why you did
8/24/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: Oh he‚Äôs beautiful
8/24/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: That candle holder fits him so well!
8/24/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: ...I may eat him
8/24/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: I do like basil a lot
8/24/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: But I won‚Äôt eat all of him
8/24/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll nibble and then just smell him
8/24/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: Okay this is a little odd
8/24/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm stopping
8/24/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy
8/24/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: I can definitely say I've had weirder tangents so no worries
8/24/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: But yes
8/24/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: He's quite a handsome one
8/24/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: We actually broke the candle holder, so we had to glue it closed on him
8/24/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Idk
8/24/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: I mean you are strange so maybe
8/24/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Oof
8/24/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Oof but true
8/24/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: Hey
8/24/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: Heyolo
8/24/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: Okay honestly your strangeness was a little much for me at first but I‚Äôm blaming my non openness to actually get to know you and all the weirdness of the semester but then during the packing it definitely clicked like this kid is actually the best
8/24/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: But it was just you being you
8/24/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: And that was so good
8/24/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: I just didn‚Äôt know you so I was like who is this kid
8/24/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: But I like getting to know you know and wouldn‚Äôt trade your quirkiness
8/24/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad Bradley has a nice little home and no gosh darn bank is gonna foreclose on him
8/24/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: OH man it was a little much for you? My bad, I didn't even realize it was coming out that badly
8/24/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: I was tryna behave myself
8/24/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: But also
8/24/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Its me
8/24/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: So I didn't want to waste your time acting like someone else
8/24/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: But HEYO it worked out so
8/24/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: But anyways!  What are your plans for the night?
8/24/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Sorry my phone died a little and I couldn't use data
8/24/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Restarting always helps I guess
8/24/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: No no it wasn‚Äôt you coming out badly
8/24/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Right now we're out for sushi! We got groceries and it was so much effort that we didn't want to cook
8/24/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: It was just someone being real and I think that was strange to me
8/24/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: But good
8/24/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: So here we are
8/24/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: HA
8/24/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: that‚Äôs always the problem he‚Äôs
8/24/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Yes**
8/24/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: Yeah sorry about that, it probably freaked you out a little to have no response
8/24/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: But the sushi is good!
8/24/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: And I was trying and like "ohhhhhh boy if she thinks I'm choosing to not respond"
8/24/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: But anyway
8/24/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: What about you? Plans?
8/24/19, 8:57 PM - Marianna: Eh it crossed my mind but genuinely I‚Äôve only ever freaked out about getting a response once and that wasn‚Äôt from you. I get people have lives so don‚Äôt worry about it!
8/24/19, 8:57 PM - Marianna: But also I do like hearing from you so keep em coming
8/24/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: Clubbing!
8/24/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: Not really
8/24/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: Robin and maybe rose and I are gonna go to another ruin bar
8/24/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: AYYYYYYY
8/24/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Ruin bars
8/24/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre fun
8/24/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
8/24/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: I JUST GOT AN EMAIL
8/24/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: CALEB
8/24/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: A VERY EXCITING ONE
8/24/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: WHATS IN THE EMAIL
8/24/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/24/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: OH MY GOSH CONGRATS THATS SO AMAZING YAY THE 14 HOUR DAYS WERE WORTH
8/24/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: IT**
8/24/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: BUT OH MY GOSH DO YOU REALIZE HOW AMAZING THAT IS YOURE 20 AND WERE ONE KF THE HIGHEST SCORING
8/24/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: So China in the spring?!
8/24/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Or is it this semester?
8/24/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: This semester!
8/24/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Which means I've got some negotiations with professors to make
8/24/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: But yay!
8/24/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: I imagine they won‚Äôt give you a hard time
8/24/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs kind of nice the flight will be much better from Copenhagen than from Charlotte
8/24/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Who on your team would go?
8/24/19, 9:36 PM - Caleb: Well Penn would pay for it
8/24/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah I figured
8/24/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: But like time wise
8/24/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Charlotte to China is like 12 hours?  Or more?
8/24/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Oh it's more
8/24/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Probably 18 or something
8/24/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Because the shortest path from Charlotte to Shenzhen is through LAX and across the pacific
8/24/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Woah
8/24/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: That makes sense I guess
8/24/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Still wouldn‚Äôt want to do it
8/24/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: You wouldn't?
8/24/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Eh that's totally fair
8/24/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Also it'd be me, Spyros, Siddhesh maybe (?), and ludo probably
8/24/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Maybe some other docs
8/24/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/24/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Update
8/24/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Plans have changed
8/24/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: I'm now doing homework :(
8/24/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: BUT
8/24/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: IT'S BECAUSE
8/24/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: We're probably going to the beach tomorrow!
8/24/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Oh the gang!  That would be sooooo fun
8/24/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: I mean if I was you I would
8/24/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: But that long of a flight sounds hurtful
8/24/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Painful**
8/24/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Words you know?
8/24/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: But oh :(
8/24/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Well yay about the beach but not about the homework
8/24/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Does it seem like it‚Äôs gonna be as much homework as davidson?
8/24/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: üò≠
8/24/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Audrey just sent me a video of her unpacking and playing here without you by 3 doors down
8/24/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: I MiSS HEr
8/24/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: No
8/24/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: Definitely not as much homework as Davidson
8/24/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: And NOOOO AUDREY
8/24/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: Is it weird that I vicariously miss her
8/24/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: I've only interacted with her twice, but both were really quality interactions
8/24/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: And I want to know her better when I'm back
8/24/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs only a little weird
8/24/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: I miss her so much though
8/24/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: And you‚Äôre just gonna hear me talking about it
8/24/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Wait frolics and when else?
8/24/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Update we‚Äôre at much less of popular ruin bar and it‚Äôs kind of nice that there‚Äôs not a ton of people. But it kind of has the vibe of f before it gets lit
8/24/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre hoping more people come
8/24/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Oh I have no idea
8/24/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: You just speak very highly of her
8/24/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: And I think we'd get along well
8/24/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Also GEEEEET LIIIIT
8/24/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: I'm drinking wine and reading about cancer now
8/24/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Update
8/24/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: I need to read something called the "Lasagna Oath"
8/24/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Now THIS is something I can get behind
8/25/19, 12:14 AM - Marianna: She deserves to be spoken highly of
8/25/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Were on bar too
8/25/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Two**
8/25/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: These places are crazy
8/25/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like multiple rooms and multiple bars
8/25/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: But we found the ‚Äúunderground‚Äù which is like a tunnel and they‚Äôre hopping music so that is where we are going after we get drinks
8/25/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: And what in the world is a lasagna oath?!?!
8/25/19, 12:28 AM - Caleb: Idk I haven't done it yet
8/25/19, 12:28 AM - Caleb: Also I've had WAY too much wine
8/25/19, 12:28 AM - Caleb: now we're watching Bachelor in Paradise
8/25/19, 12:53 AM - Caleb: Hey please be safe tonight by the way
8/25/19, 12:53 AM - Caleb: Text me when you're back in your apartment
8/25/19, 12:58 AM - Marianna: Oh you good?
8/25/19, 12:59 AM - Marianna: And I see the homework lasted long
8/25/19, 12:59 AM - Marianna: I will!
8/25/19, 12:59 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve found the f of Budapest
8/25/19, 12:59 AM - Marianna: Or at least one of them
8/25/19, 1:00 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good good
8/25/19, 1:32 AM - Caleb: I did half of the he homework

8/25/19, 2:29 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good!
8/25/19, 2:29 AM - Marianna: Had a good night!
8/25/19, 2:29 AM - Marianna: Found the COOLEST ruin bar
8/25/19, 2:29 AM - Marianna: In my unexpert opinion
8/25/19, 2:29 AM - Marianna: Definitely would like to take you there
8/25/19, 2:30 AM - Marianna: But I am back in my apartment now!!
8/25/19, 2:30 AM - Marianna: And ready to sleep
8/25/19, 2:52 AM - Marianna: Okay i think you‚Äôre asleep but I just wanted to say you should be sooooo proud of me tonight because I‚Äôm proud of me!  I only had two drinks out because I didn‚Äôt want to be too drunk far from my place and then I got back here and SHOWERED and TOOK OFF MY MAKEUP AND CONTACTS I like never do any of that wow impressed
8/25/19, 2:53 AM - Marianna: I also just had so much fun I danced my ass off and sang and I missed it but it was SOOOOO my scene I want to go back soonish
8/25/19, 2:53 AM - Marianna: Okay goodnight!  I have a piece of bread and piglet in bed with me so I‚Äôm in for a good sleep
8/25/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Hello! Good morning!
8/25/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Sorry about that, Reid was having some lady troubles so we ended up drinking a lot more than intended
8/25/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: I'm glad you had a good night! It sounds like a ton of fun
8/25/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: But now I'm REALLY in the mood for commons
8/25/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Oh woah goodmorning
8/25/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Marianna
8/25/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Not morning
8/25/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt slept past noon on a long time
8/25/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
8/25/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a colloquial thing you say when you wake up!
8/25/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm amazed right now
8/25/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Sorry I kinda sorta passed out last night by the way
8/25/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: The night was a slippery slope
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: But hey! I'm glad you're alive
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: good one?
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: Last party night for a while for me
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: Even though it wasn't a party
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: It was just hanging out, goofing off, and getting drunk
8/25/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay I stayed out v late everyone sensible was asleep
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: I am indeed alive and not even hung over!
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: Oh wow
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: Really to the last party night?
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: You've got an iron liver
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: I only had like two drinks
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: Oh right rifjt
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: Right
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: Also I swear to God I'm an awful texter sober
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: Good decision Marianna is back
8/25/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: Lots of typos
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: And I stop caring about them drunk
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Yes you are but I enjoy it so please don‚Äôt stop
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Me too!
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: I think I've got a theory
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: People think I'm WAY more drunk than I actually am
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Because I start goofing off and my coordination goes down the drain, and I say things with like 0 inhibition
8/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: (and lots of typos)
8/25/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: But I'm not doing it directly because im drunk
8/25/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: I do it because I work hard when I'm sober to keep the silly, uncoordinated, and spontaneous parts of me very inhibited
8/25/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: So when I drink, it's not a "I'm drunk thus doing these things", it's a "I'm tipsy so I don't care about keeping this side of me in", and it's not something people see a lot of
8/25/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: If that makes sense
8/25/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: Okay I swear I‚Äôm not stealing your bit but I‚Äôm the same way
8/25/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: And I can act WILDLY drunk on purpose while being sober
8/25/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: I also get contact drunk
8/25/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Like if everyone else has left their inhibitions behind, so do I
8/25/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Where you all just with your flat mates last night?
8/25/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Also is Reid good after his girl drama?
8/25/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah if was just me, Reid, and Hannah
8/25/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Hannah and I were therapizing Reid at dinner
8/25/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: He's having lady issues
8/25/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: She's kinda relying on him for happiness and self confidence
8/25/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: And had an opportunity to come to Copenhagen on a free ticket for her work
8/25/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: But only for like 3 days
8/25/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: But she had reservations about it
8/25/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Particularly that they wouldn't last until then, so that if she made plans and things fall apart, it would be painful to still come to Copenhagen, or have to cancel the work trip
8/25/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Sooo yeah they had some issues to work out
8/25/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: All is (allegedly) well now though
8/25/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Also GEEZ stop stealing my bit, only I'm allowed to do that!
8/25/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: What if at some point, we're both sober, but think the other person is drunk, so we both act very drunk when neither of us are
8/25/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: That'd be hilarious
8/25/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: And also was some major mental gymnastics
8/25/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: So she‚Äôs only like using him for support and not willing to give it back?
8/25/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: And I mean that‚Äôs a valid reservation and that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean she THINKS they won‚Äôt last she‚Äôs just protecting herself. Like how long have they been together or not together or whatever they‚Äôve defined themselves as?  If it hasn‚Äôt been long, I could see that she might not want to rush into making plans
8/25/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Just playing the devils advocate
8/25/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: If I was her I‚Äôd take the free trip to Copenhagen no doubts at all
8/25/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: That would be funny
8/25/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: I can just picture the moment when one of us asks the other ‚Äúwait, how much have you had to drink?‚Äù And then the truth comes out and we‚Äôre like ah cool cool we‚Äôre **cool** people
8/25/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Jokes on you I pretty much act drunk all the time anyway üòéüòéüòé
8/25/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: ... But only a little
8/25/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: And only accidentally
8/25/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah, Hannah was giving most of the advice in the situation
8/25/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: I'd played devils advocate a little too
8/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: But Hannah and her boyfriend just went though a sorta similar situation
8/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Where he wanted to come out, but it was expensive, and she was trying to basically say it's okay if you don't want to spend a thousand dollars and travel 30 hours round-trip to see me for two days
8/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: And it's not the end of the world that way
8/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: And so he's not coming out, but they're fine with it
8/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: All in all I think that coming out and seeing him, and those reservations isn't the big deal
8/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: I think there's a lot of other things that it surfaces, and THOSE are big deals
8/25/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: This is just a symptom of those things
8/25/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah no that makes sense for him to not go
8/25/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: But i totally agree about the fact that OTHER things are a bit deal in these situations not just the I can‚Äôt visit
8/25/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs usually the reason you don‚Äôt WANT to visit that is the issue
8/25/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: But I had a davidson friend who did that and visited her boyfriend in spring semester while he was in Switzerland
8/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: And wooo yay she got to go to Switzerland
8/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: But then he dumped her like a month later if that
8/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: Because abroad was too much
8/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: And we were like okay but she did her best
8/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Abroad is just a weird time because it‚Äôs like a lot of people are in solid relationships but it can make or break it I think
8/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: I think all my friends are gonna make it
8/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: I hope they all do
8/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: But who knows it‚Äôs only August still
8/25/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: OH LORD your poor friend
8/25/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: :(
8/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's really summer and abroad, but mostly abroad I think
8/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: Because summer is just long distance
8/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: Abroad is hard because if you're home, and their abroad, you get to watch from afar as they have the time of their life, make new friends, and experience a wonderful place, all without you
8/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: And that's gotta be brutal
8/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: And oh my word I can't believe it's still August
8/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: I can't tell if this semester is going to be long or short
8/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: But it definitely won't be in the middle
8/25/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah no it was rough but we took care of her and then she had a fun semester after that soooo
8/25/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre both on campus now so I‚Äôm curious how that is
8/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah wait I‚Äôve only been here a week
8/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Some people haven‚Äôt even left the us yet
8/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: I kind of want it to be long
8/25/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: Yeah, me too, but also I'm gonna miss Davidson a lot by the end of it
8/25/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: I mean, I already do
8/25/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: But I'll be ready to go back at some point
8/25/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Also, what days were you thinking about seeing each other in October? I think you mentioned some, but I'm terrible at remembering specifics unless I see them
8/25/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: I have October 5-13 off, and then the conference is 13-17 if I can get off school for that
8/25/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: Oct 4-6 sarah and I are thinking about doing Oktoberfest 
Oct 25-nov 3 is my fall break with Sarah 
And the rest of the weekends are free!
8/25/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the nov 29-dec 1 weekend that Sarah and her parents will be in Munich so we should do something then
8/25/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Okay, well then
8/25/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: That pretty much answers what I needed
8/25/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: I'm just sorta tryna figure out what airport I'd need to fly out of
8/25/19, 2:23 PM - Caleb: I'll just put on my calendar now that November 29 to December 1 is reserved
8/25/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: What do you think your school week is going to look like
8/25/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: Because what are your thoughts on this
8/25/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: Since Budapest is in between here and China
8/25/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: What if I came on like that Thursday afternoon or something, and then I explore on my own/drink unhealthy amounts of coffee while you're in class and taking care of your stuff, and then we have Friday night through Sunday night, and I could fly to China on Sunday night or early Monday morning
8/25/19, 2:31 PM - Caleb: Oh and I know you mentioned other dates too, but this one is kinda time sensitive (in the next few days) so I figured it'd be best to just work out a rough plan now
8/25/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôd love that!
8/25/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: (Is that a better response that oh sure?)
8/25/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: ((See!  Improvement!))
8/25/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: I will say and I don‚Äôt know if you care but I probably will be on my period the nov-dec weekend but that‚Äôs just kind of how the ducks fall into place but I could also just skip it that month and it‚Äôd be fine but I‚Äôll see but also I know (er I hope I guess) that that‚Äôs not the end of the world and itd still be cool to do something then
8/25/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: But we probably also should talk to make plans if we want to do anything in sept like could I visit Copenhagen?  And wish you happy birthday a little late?
8/25/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's all fine by me
8/25/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Most certainly not the end of the world
8/25/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: November December is fine anyway because we'll both be back at school like a month after that
8/25/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: So hey I guess I can be patient!
8/25/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: And yeah! I'll check on my actual schedule sometime, but I'd be delighted to have you here for a weekend
8/25/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: ALSO
8/25/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Oh what a gentleman
8/25/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Okie dokie about the schedule. Sarah and I might do the amalfi coast sometime but idk
8/25/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: And well have to figure out where exactly we can go for nov-dec weekend
8/25/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: And ooooh
8/25/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs 3pm
8/25/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: I had scrambled eggs for breakfast
8/25/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: And another one of the hot sausages (update they are STILL too hot hot damn)
8/25/19, 3:17 PM - Caleb: Too hot? Hot damn
8/25/19, 3:17 PM - Caleb: Call the authorities, as Bruno Mars would say
8/25/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: Also I think it was totally acceptable for lunch
8/25/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: It was certainly tasty enough
8/25/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: And also had tomato and basil for that sweet sweet color
8/25/19, 3:22 PM - Marianna: üò±üò±
8/25/19, 3:22 PM - Marianna: DID YOU HURT BENTLEY
8/25/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: Of course not! Never!
8/25/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Bradley on the other hand
8/25/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: Ah shoot
8/25/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: BRADLEY
8/25/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: as soon as I typed it I was like that‚Äôs not right what‚Äôs his name
8/25/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah but he's still bathing in the sun and freshly watered
8/25/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: So it's all fine
8/25/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm happy with him
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: For him
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Because you're also bathing in the sun and freshly watered?
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: No :(
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt left
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: My apartment
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm going out at 4 though
8/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: To hopefully finally get a yoga pass
8/25/19, 3:26 PM - Marianna: And some groceries
8/25/19, 3:26 PM - Marianna: Oh wait I thought you were going to the beach today?
8/25/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: I am! We're en route
8/25/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs exciting!
8/25/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Is it like a normal beach or a cold beach or what?
8/25/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/25/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: It's apparently a nice one
8/25/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: And heavily recommended
8/25/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: So I'll send some pictures when I get there
8/25/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: WAIT
8/25/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Which means I'll ALSO be watered and laying in the sun!
8/25/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Life is g√ºd
8/25/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: So, you got any plans today?
8/25/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: You and Bradley with be #twinning
8/25/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: But I would love pictures!
8/25/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: And no not really
8/25/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm honestly telling myself it‚Äôs too hot out
8/25/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Also I don‚Äôt enjoy going places by myself like I can but I‚Äôd rather see cool things with people
8/25/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: So I can‚Äôt wait for sarah to get here
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's totally fine
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: It's nice all year round there anyway
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: I'm kinda trying to fit things in before it gets cold
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Bwcause
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Ya know
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Scandinavia I guess
8/25/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: However! I'm looking forward to the cold too
8/25/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/25/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: So apparently it‚Äôs robins excuse too not to go outside
8/25/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: And Hans was like yeah but won‚Äôt it be too cold at some point
8/25/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: But there should be a good bit of nice fall weather
8/25/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm looking forward to that
8/25/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: Like sweater but no jacket
8/25/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: And able to walk around and not get tooo sweaty

8/25/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: HOW BIG
8/25/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: school reading first
8/25/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: Maybe take a break for fun reading
8/25/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: But school reading first
8/25/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah the school reading is due Tuesday
8/25/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: But I'll still do it
8/25/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs only two days from now
8/25/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: :(
8/25/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Sunday scaries go away
8/25/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Also the beach is nice
8/25/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: It's a tiny strip of sand
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Okay but how much homework do you have?
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Lots of people
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Oh not too much right now
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Send pictures when you can!
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: But still ill read it
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Okay!
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: ALSO
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Word of advice
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: If you're ever in Scandinavia, going to a beach
8/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Do yourself a favor and don't go with any loud Americans for their first time
8/25/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: We saw a top less woman and my roommate looked SHOCKED
8/25/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: Which is also why I'm refraining from pictures right now btw
8/25/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Ah yes that can be a shock
8/25/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Barcelona was like that
8/25/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: My mom was snapping away with photos and we were like uh mom there are full on naked people over there stop
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: With minimal invasion of privacy
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: And oh NO JUDY PLEASE
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: :((
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Oh it does look nice!
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/25/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Culture shock is always REAL for her
8/25/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: She gets very flustered
8/25/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: With anything she‚Äôs not totally used to
8/25/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Ah I mean at a certain point you can't help that
8/25/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: I mean, maybe do your homework beforehand, but things will always catch you off guard
8/25/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: My only thing is just don't stick out like a sore thumb
8/25/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: Yes but it‚Äôs like exaggerated as part of her character
8/25/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs charming though
8/25/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: And she does do her homework beforehand but is still shocked
8/25/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh
8/25/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/25/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: Yeah I gotcha
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Ahaha
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt got me
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Piglets got me
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: And my bed
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: And gossip girl
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: All I can think of now is that one "YOU SPILLED LIPSTICK IN MY VALINTO BAG?!"
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: (These people are still awful but it‚Äôs so entertaining)
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Just that sound
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: What
8/25/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Whenever your mom gets culture shock
8/25/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: That's what I'm imagining she does
8/25/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: I don't have good internet so just do yourself a favor and look it up
8/25/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: Pfft she doesn‚Äôt have Valentino
8/25/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: Or valinto as you say
8/25/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: Oh okay I will
8/25/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: WOW IVE SEEN HER DO THAT EXACT SAME REACTION
8/25/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: YESSS
8/25/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: I'm glad its accurate
8/25/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: I thought it was just hilarious
8/25/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Also, I totally want to come back here in the winter
8/25/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: It would be very calm with no one around
8/25/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Or the crazy few who are willing to join me
8/25/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: We have a tradition to dip our feet in the water in Hilton Head on New Year‚Äôs Eve or New Years day or as close as we can get if we have to leave before then
8/25/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: Pretty cold
8/25/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: But not many people
8/25/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the water you‚Äôre on?
8/25/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: It's the strait between Sweden and Denmark
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Woah
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: How long is it between the shores?
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: So Baltic sea I guess?
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: It's about 20 miles I think
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: So if I swim REALLY REALLY far
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: I'd make it
8/25/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Shorter than the English channel I believe
8/25/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: And isn‚Äôt it something special to swim the English Channel?
8/25/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: I mean
8/25/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: I'd assume so
8/25/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: I think it was a pretty big goal for a whole
8/25/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: A bunch of people died trying it
8/25/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: And I think someone eventually got it
8/25/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: Did I ever tell you about the lake I swam at in Sweden?
8/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Update I went adventuring
8/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: And by adventuring I mean grocery shopping
8/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: But!  I bought traditional Hungarian candy to try
8/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: And helped two people who were like do you speak English?
8/25/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: Was more helpful to one because I forgot the Hungarian word for lentils
8/25/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: But she still got them
8/25/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: And yeah that sounds like what I‚Äôm thinking of
8/25/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: And no I don‚Äôt think so. What‚Äôs up with the lake you swam in in Sweden?
8/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Hey
8/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Jokes on you
8/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: When you can't understand anything, grocery shopping IS an adventure
8/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: But also you're basically a Hungarian pro by now
8/25/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Also those people are so nice! I had a sweet old Danish lady help me out one time because I was looking confused in the herb isle, and then she saw I had Google translate open
8/25/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: And the lake was just in the middle of Sweden, the type of place only locals go
8/25/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs true
8/25/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm becoming a pro at errands
8/25/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs all I do to get out do my house honestly
8/25/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Baby steps?
8/25/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: And now!  The moment we‚Äôve all been waiting for because it‚Äôs long overdue!
8/25/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Painting my nails!
8/25/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: And heeeyyy what color did you decide to go with?
8/25/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: OH it‚Äôs so pretty
8/25/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: I love it
8/25/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: Glittery dark gray for toes and the really pale blue for fingers
8/25/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Very nice very nice
8/25/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: I'm still at the beach
8/25/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Got a short nap in
8/25/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Didn't get burnt
8/25/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: So I'd call that a win
8/25/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Ooooooh
8/25/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Congrats
8/25/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so impressive

8/25/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: ...no

8/25/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: I've done it
8/25/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: I opened a bag of salt
8/25/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: And it ripped down the side
8/25/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: And went EVERYWHERE
8/25/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: Third time I've vacuumed today
8/25/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: CALEB
8/25/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: come on now
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: Wait why did you vacuum so much
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not normal
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: Hey did you know you‚Äôre not normal
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: 1) broken glass in the carpet
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: I woke up and stepped in it
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: So I vacuumed
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: 2) I had a bunch of sand in my shoe
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: Wait where did the glass come from?
8/25/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: And accidentally spilled it everywhere like 50 minutes ago
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: I know where the sand came from
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: I think
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: Someone knocked over a glass last night
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: Also if your foot okay??
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: They picked up the big chunks but not the fine ones
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: And yeah yeah it's fine, it didn't really bleed
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: I just kinda brushed them off
8/25/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: And then 3) the great grain spill of 2019
8/25/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: So BOY you best believe my apartment is CLEAN
8/25/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Well the floor anyway
8/25/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre a pretty clean person
8/25/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: I know my room can get bad but it‚Äôs never gross
8/25/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: But congrats
8/25/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Cleanliness is next to holiness or something, right?
8/25/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: I have like 0 idea what that means besides moms trying to get their kids to clean back in like the 1860s
8/25/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: I have never heard that
8/25/19, 8:40 PM - Caleb: ... Huh?
8/25/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: My Nonna just says that a clean room is better to sleep in
8/25/19, 8:40 PM - Caleb: I think it just means that cleanliness is a virtue
8/25/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: I know when I‚Äôm stressed at school, I NEED my room to be perfectly clean or it just adds to my stress
8/25/19, 8:40 PM - Caleb: An organized room is an organized life
8/25/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: THAT'S something I firmly believe in
8/25/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Oh got it
8/25/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: I guess cleanliness is a virtue
8/25/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: I agree with everything expect the whole made bed thing
8/25/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Messy bed is better
8/25/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Clean everything is better
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: A messy bed is great
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: But it's gotta be a * tasteful * messy
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: Not dirty
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: Not sheets on the floor
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: They've gotta be fluffy
8/25/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: And crisp
8/25/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: WHAT I thought you said you liked made beds
8/25/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: I certainly do
8/25/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: But hey
8/25/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: I've had a messy bed with you, and gotta say, you might have swayed me
8/25/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/25/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: I do do that üòâ
8/25/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just so much more comfy!!!
8/25/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Gotta say
8/25/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Made beds are comfy
8/25/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Just slide in, you're tucked in nice in tight
8/25/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: But MESSY beds
8/25/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Are an art
8/25/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: And more fun
8/25/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: üòâ
8/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: And I would consider myself an _artist_ at messy beds
8/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: But messy beds themselves, yes, those are fun
8/25/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: BUT how the beds get messy?  Much much more fun in my experience üòâ
8/25/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: Update the Hungary candy thing is pretty good but a tad bit odd
8/25/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Oohoho
8/25/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Ooohohohoho
8/25/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

8/25/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs a kind of candy called t√∫r√≥ rudi
8/25/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like chocolate with some kind of sweet cheese or cream filling
8/25/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: And it has to be refrigerated
8/25/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: AND OH GOD THEYRE HAUNTING YOU
8/25/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: YOUR FBI AGENT IS TRYING TO SPOOP YOU
8/25/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: wait I thought that was you
8/25/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: SPOOPED
8/25/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Also that sounds delicious

8/25/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: Not the lawyer thing
8/25/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs pretty good
8/25/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: The candy
8/25/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Not super sweet though
8/25/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: ... We're still talking about the candy to be clear
8/25/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: But yeah those are my favorites
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: Things that aren't too sweet
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: Yes
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: I like things with really bold flavor
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: It doesn‚Äôt really
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: Even if it isn't conventionally sweet or anything
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: OH
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: At the farmers market
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just not a normal taste
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: There was this stand handing out samples of spirits
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: And I tried this one that was smoked juniper
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: And it was really really delicious
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: How was it?
8/25/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: But my friends hated it
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: It was such an interesting flavor
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt gin made from juniper?
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: Juniper is used to flavor gin
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: Oh wait
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: No no you're right sorry
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: Close enough?
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: I was thinking of something else
8/25/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: THIS was flavored with juniper
8/25/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: It wasn't made with juniper though
8/25/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: Sorry
8/25/19, 9:27 PM - Marianna: Hah!
8/25/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: But it had a smokey, burnt taste to it
8/25/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: And I surprisingly enjoyed it
8/25/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: This is only semi related
8/25/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: It was at the festival and I remember I didn't send you many pictures
8/25/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: This was the bar!
8/25/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Or where they were based
8/25/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: They had a stand though
8/25/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Looks so cool
8/25/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: I feel like I‚Äôve seen a lot of re-decked industrial vibe from Copenhagen
8/25/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: Well, apparently up until the 60s, it was pretty much solely an industrial city
8/25/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: Nyhavn, which is the really famous, colorful, waterfront shops in the tourist district
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: ... I didn't finish that sentence
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Nope
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: It was like a subject
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Nyhavn was a parking lot until like 65
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Marianna brain didn‚Äôt appreciate it
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Ah
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: And the whole city was grimey, and a little depressing
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Despite having been around since like the 1060s
8/25/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Fun things from my History of Copenhagen class!
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Cool!
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: My teacher gave a presentation to the mayor of Denver, Colorado about this
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Is the city still grimey?
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: WELL
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: No
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: Not at all
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: Unless you're out at 4 am
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Wait why Denver
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: Why not Denver!
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: But it's a very clean, cozy city
8/25/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: (Copenhagen)
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: Uh I still stand by why Denver?
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Caleb: And a crew goes though all the steets at about 5 am, and pick up all the trash, and hose the city down
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: Woah
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs intense
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Caleb: It's the price they pay to live in a gorgeous old city I guess
8/25/19, 9:36 PM - Caleb: Lots of taxes
8/25/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: Then that‚Äôs two prices
8/25/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: Being woken up by washing
8/25/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: And taxes
8/25/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Sorry I just got off the phone with my parents
8/25/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: But yep
8/25/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: One of these days I want to get up really early
8/25/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Then I can find a little coffee shop, sit there, sip on something hot, watch them come though and clean, then watch the commuters go by, the sun rise, and then the tourists flood in
8/25/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: I think seeing the whole city wake up would be really cool
8/25/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds so cool
8/25/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: I genuinely think this city never sleeps
8/25/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: Oh how are the rents!
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Rent in Copenhagen?
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: I mean mines not too bad
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: But also I live in student housing
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Pretty nice student housing, but student housing
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOODNESS we did walk by some beautiful houses though
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: I got some pictures on Veev
8/25/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: It was by the beach we were at
8/25/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Oh and this city sleeps
8/25/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: DEFINITELY sleeps
8/25/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: They're a very relaxed people
8/25/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Caleb
8/25/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: ‚ÄòRents
8/25/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: As in PArents
8/25/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Who you were talking to
8/25/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Ah I like relaxed people
8/25/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: ...
8/25/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/25/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: So we walked through the other districts
8/25/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: And district 5 is very very nice and quiet
8/25/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe financial district‚Äù so probably higher rent than mine
8/25/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: They have ac
8/25/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: But I have an oven!
8/25/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: Did you just refer to your apartment as an oven
8/25/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: I mean yes
8/25/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: But I do have an actual Owen and they don‚Äôt
8/25/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Oven**
8/25/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Also my parents are good! I just kinda sent them a billion pictures and talked about them
8/25/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Because I figured the best way to show them what I'm up to would be picyirex
8/25/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Pictures *
8/25/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Wow go Caleb
8/25/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: It's the jetlag
8/25/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Obvi
8/25/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Caleb it‚Äôs been like two weeks
8/25/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm calling bs
8/25/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: It's been one week and one day
8/25/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: And OUCH
8/25/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Woah wait no way
8/25/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: You just saying I'm clumsy? _impossible_
8/25/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Wait
8/25/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: When did I say that
8/25/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: I mean yes
8/25/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt remember saying it since like this morning
8/25/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: How could you let me forget it! For shame
8/25/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: So, you got a lot of homework tonight?
8/25/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Also, do you like Queen?
8/25/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Hey I don‚Äôt mean any harm anyway you know that?
8/25/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: And no!  We haven‚Äôt really started getting homework
8/25/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: And yes!
8/25/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Beatles better but still like queen
8/25/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/513QNSmBY7dkF2BMGmagRz?si=vFS6tAN-QKqU70X0Z-7bXg
8/25/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Well I've been very much enjoying that today
8/25/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Oh i like it
8/25/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I like the more rock stuff though I think
8/25/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: Like the song that followed it on Spotify was don‚Äôt stop me now
8/25/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: Did you ever see the bohemian rhapsody movie?
8/25/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: Nope
8/25/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: I can't say I have
8/25/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: I've really been slacking on the movies recently, haven't I?
8/25/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt either
8/25/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Add it to the list?
8/25/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: Wanted to but I think it came out during the school year and I never see movies in theaters during the school year
8/25/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: To the list!
8/25/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Oh wow this list isn't half bad, it's gonna be a fun one
8/25/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: And oh man I totally feel that
8/25/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Even if I have time, it's just so stressful for me to sit there and do nothing
8/25/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: I gotta chill
8/25/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: Can we do it all in a semester?
8/25/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: I kind of forget what we‚Äôve put it on
8/25/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Well
8/25/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Maybe not
8/25/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: But it just means we'll have a hard time running out of things to do
8/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs good I guess
8/25/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: And if it takes more time then a semester to finish, fine by me üòÅ
8/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Ha
8/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll put up with me for that long potentially?
8/25/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Hmmm, well
8/25/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/25/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: That's the idea
8/25/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Trickster!
8/25/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: UNLESS we exhaust the all-powerful list, in which case, we better keep it growing ;)
8/25/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Dates are fun, I don't want to ever settle into a routine of not doing them
8/25/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: We seem to be pretty creative people
8/25/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: And smart to boot
8/25/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Especially you mr highly ranked paper going to China
8/25/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Full disclosure I absolutely love dates
8/25/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Like even if they‚Äôre study dates or commons dates
8/25/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: But also more exciting ones I guess
8/25/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Well perfect
8/25/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Here's to some fun dates coming our way
8/25/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: üçª
8/25/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Yay!
8/25/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the rest of your night been since the beach?
8/25/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: Well it sure just got a little more stressful
8/25/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: But hey I'm surviving
8/25/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Oh no!  Did you do the wrong reading?
8/25/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: No
8/25/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: It was just two readings, and he snuck the second one in there
8/25/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: It looked like the end of the citation, but it was a semicolon and a second item
8/25/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: üôÉ
8/25/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: What about you? How's the rest of your night been?
8/25/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Oh evil professors
8/25/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Mines been more of the same
8/25/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: I also FaceTimed my parents today
8/25/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: There was a gas explosion in our town
8/25/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: No one was hurt
8/25/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: WOAH
8/25/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: And they‚Äôre celebrating being empty nesters by going to a movie tonight and complaining that Joey wasn‚Äôt around to do dishes
8/25/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/25/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha sounds about right
8/25/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: So they're taking it well so far?
8/25/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: They say it hasn‚Äôt hit them yet
8/25/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Like they saw him on Friday
8/25/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: So he‚Äôs been gone for longer than this for speech and debate tournaments
8/25/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: It sounds like you think it'll hit soon though
8/25/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: How do you think they'll feel?
8/25/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs not good at communicating
8/25/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: So I think judy might feel it when she doesn‚Äôt hear from him
8/25/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: I mean she texted me like 5 times last night over different platforms asking me if I was at home yet even though she darn knew I wasn‚Äôt because she tracks me
8/25/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: :(
8/25/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
8/25/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: That isn't right that you're going to be feeling the consequences of Joey not communicating
8/25/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: What do you think you'll do to help ease the transition for her? Just be patient?
8/25/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Eh it was fine
8/25/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: I texted her when I got back
8/25/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: God forbid the night I forget to text her
8/25/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: She also reminded me to not walk alone at night
8/25/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs not entirely possible I can‚Äôt ask my girlfriends to because then they have to walk farther back alone and I don‚Äôt want to ask one of the guys and give the wrong impression
8/25/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt tell her that part
8/25/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: It would just concern her more
8/25/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: I just told her my square is always busy so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm ever TRULY alone
8/25/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: I just wanna say that if you ever feel unsafe and need a guy to walk you home, PLEASE do
8/25/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Also apparently Margaux had a lit night and got engaged to a Dane so I think she‚Äôs doing better
8/25/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Don't let me ever make you have a second thought about that
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Ha well thank you but I‚Äôm gonna take care of myself and not be too plastered to need someone for the next 10 days and then I‚Äôll have sarah to walk back with
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Okok
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: And yay! Good for Margaux!
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Wait wait
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Hang on
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Did I read that right
8/25/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not really a you thing I wouldn‚Äôt want to lead anyone on for any reason
8/25/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve decided this is a GOOD DECISIONS!semester
8/25/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Meaning watching my drinking and all that jazz

8/25/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Okay so what he was plastered and it was on a bus
8/25/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre hanging out again because some of his friends like some of her friends too and she thinks he‚Äôs cute so

8/25/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: It's been eight days Marianna
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: But BOY lemme tell ya
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: If you're walking home at 2am on a Saturday, you might just see a group of Danish men in the square playing a game that looks something like this:
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: There are beer bottles on the ground
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: They have a blindfold
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: They're drinking
8/25/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: And yelling
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: The Danish language sounds drunk as is, so idk how any of it was understood by anyone
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: They try to whack the bottles over
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: It involved a blindfold
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: It was odd
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: And I just wanted borgor king
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Or I had just had borgor king
8/25/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Idk, wild night
8/25/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: That does sound fun
8/25/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: We passed some British guys (or possibly scottish there seem to be a lot of them here) singing loudly in a park
8/25/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: And at the ruin bar, we were walking down a hallway and these two ladies were on either side and they saw us and started chanting ‚ÄúYOU GO GIRLS YOU GO GIRLS‚Äù
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Awwwww
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Such support
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Drunk people are great
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I LOVE drunk people
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Most of the time
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Only sometimes
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Ha!
8/25/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Occasionally

8/26/19, 11:17 AM - Caleb: Looks beautiful
8/26/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: I feel like I've seen a ton of pictures from that view
8/26/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Or at least that angle
8/26/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: I guess overlooking the Danube is a photogenic view
8/26/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/26/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: The Danube is pretty photogenic
8/26/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Either the left statue guy has a hat on or he has HELLA bushy eyebrows
8/26/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: I'm going with the eyebrows
8/26/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs eyebrows
8/26/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs Lao ce
8/26/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Oh wait
8/26/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Are they not even Hungarian philosophers?
8/26/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: ... Does Hungary have many philosophers?
8/26/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Nope
8/26/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: It also had Jesus, Gandhi, st Francis of Assisi, and Buddha
8/26/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Idk if Hungary has any philosophers of its own
8/26/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not too well versed in my Hungary history
8/26/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Well still pretty cool
8/26/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: All I got on Denmark is Kierkegaard
8/26/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: He's kinda important I guess
8/26/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: But other than that, ehhhh
8/26/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Oh man, did I tell you yesterday about my friend who LITERALLY never heard of Odin, and had no idea Thor was from Nordic Mythology?
8/26/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Kierkegaard?
8/26/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: And woah really?
8/26/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm back at my apartment having lunch!
8/26/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Two of my friends were like oh can we grab food and come back to your place and I kind of wanted to be like no I wanted to just chill for lunch but I also want to hang out with people so now they‚Äôre coming over
8/26/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: And then we are going to see a Hungarian film afterwards
8/26/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Kierkegaard was like the founder of Christian Nihilism
8/26/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Which ended up being pretty influential
8/26/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: And yeah! It's insane, I was talking about my homework, and Thor and Odin and she was like "who??? Wait they're from Danish history??" it was surreal
8/26/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: And aw
8/26/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: :(
8/26/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: It's the worst when people invite themselves
8/26/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: I totally get the need for some alone/downtime
8/26/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: Wait I thought they were just mythology they were real?
8/26/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: Well it was more like Hans asked robin if she was going back to my place and robin was like uh I guess and then I couldn‚Äôt be like what Hans just invited you I wasn‚Äôt planning on this and then Hans was like oh cool can I tag along?
8/26/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Weird man
8/26/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: But I made a pretty heckling good sandwich
8/26/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Hecking **
8/26/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: And a cup of instant coffee :)
8/26/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Well
8/26/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: The best part about ancient history is you have to believe it, even if it isn't true
8/26/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: (but no they weren't real)
8/26/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: Oh oh got it
8/26/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Also class is starting!
8/26/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Oh a exciting have fun/good luck!
8/26/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Robin just lost her phone so we went a looking
8/26/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: And we found it!
8/26/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: This theater is so odd it‚Äôs like really long and narrow
8/26/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: But the seats are pretty comfy so we‚Äôll see if I sleep
8/26/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Theater? You guys watching a movie?
8/26/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Also I have one class's approval for the conference!
8/26/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: She was really nice about it
8/26/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Oh and also, I really hope you haven't sent anything to me yet
8/26/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: I tried to get a package because I needed a new laptop charger, and it says the delivery just failed, so I'll let you know when I work out exactly what the right address is
8/26/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah an old Hungarian movie
8/26/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a satire about communism?
8/26/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: But not very clear
8/26/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Oh. Where did you order it from?  And I haven‚Äôt sent anything yet but maybe I‚Äôll just save anything for when I see you
8/26/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: You know if I was gonna send anything
8/26/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Who knows
8/26/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Also there is someone so asleep in this theater like you can hear their breathing and it is so asleep breathing
8/26/19, 3:46 PM - Caleb: Well
8/26/19, 3:46 PM - Caleb: It's a satire about communism
8/26/19, 3:46 PM - Caleb: That sounds like a license to sleep, kinda like whenever the teacher would roll in the VCR in elementary school
8/26/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: You KNOW it's gonna be a good class when that happened
8/26/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Also I just ordered it from Amazon, so I'm gonna ask my flatmates whats up when I get back
8/26/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah I should have slept I couldn‚Äôt tell you what that was about
8/26/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: And well it was explained to me not to order anything from amazon.com
8/26/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Sorry didn‚Äôt mean to send the link it did that
8/26/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Whatsapp thinks it‚Äôs too smart for me
8/26/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: I was told ordering from there may cause issues with customs because it has to come from the us. But if you order from the German or another European amazon, it should be easier
8/26/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: I finally opened my windows and it lets in all kinds of nice lights but everyone I can see everyone which means everyone can see me
8/26/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: Out of class!
8/26/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: I got a Danish text from UPS
8/26/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: So I need to figure that out
8/26/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: And hey! It's okay because they won't care
8/26/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Unless you're like dancing around your apartment naked or something
8/26/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: In which case you do you
8/26/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: They have google translate for a reason
8/26/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Apparently they have a photo translate tool now
8/26/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Idk how it works I need to look into it
8/26/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: And well I sometimes dance around here but I rarely dance around naked
8/26/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: But thank you for your support!
8/26/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: WELL NOWS YOUR CHANCE!
8/26/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Before Sarah gets there!
8/26/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Jkjk
8/26/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: But anyways, how was the company at your apartment? You guys have a good time?
8/26/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think Sarah would care
8/26/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: But I would
8/26/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: It was good!
8/26/19, 6:34 PM - Marianna: We didn‚Äôt spend that much time because we had to find robins phone
8/26/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: But we still had adventures around the subway and things the rest of the day which was fun
8/26/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: How were classes???
8/26/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Good!
8/26/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Well
8/26/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: One class was eh
8/26/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Medical ethics
8/26/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: It's a bunch of premeds who don't actually care about the subject that much, but it means they didn't do the reading
8/26/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: And it was an in class discussion
8/26/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: And I was the only one in my group who printed mine, so everyone mooched
8/26/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: And no one had anything insightful to say
8/26/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: So they just talked to sound smart, but didn't say anything that the text didn't explicitly state
8/26/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: So that was kinda frustrating
8/26/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: But then I went to this fun coffee shop, and went to my next class
8/26/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: And that class is just super basic concepts about cancer right now, so it's not very interesting, but I like the professor a lot
8/26/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/26/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: My
8/26/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Gosh
8/26/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the worst
8/26/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: That actually sounds like a nightmare
8/26/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Did I tell you about the student distracting my language teacher the other day?
8/26/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Okay but more importantly how was the coffee?
8/26/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Well you can bet that the cancer class will get good eventually if you are interested
8/26/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Oh man don't even get me started
8/26/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: It felt like being in public school again, except people were trying really hard to sound smart
8/26/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: And coffee was good! I had a goat cheese sandwich there too, which was absolutely delicious
8/26/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I even ran into a professor there
8/26/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: And yeah you did! THAT'S about as bad as I think I can imagine
8/26/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Idk how you refrained from snapping at them
8/26/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
8/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: At intern briefings, we HATED the people who stood up to ‚Äúask questions‚Äù and just tried to sound impressive to whatever executive was on the stage and then end with the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù: ‚Äúso does that sound about right?‚Äù
8/26/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
8/26/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: I know those people well
8/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: My day was good!
8/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Not tooo much going on
8/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: The rain was nice
8/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: I feel like that's such a freshman thing to do
8/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: And yay! I'm glad the rain was nice
8/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Even if you got caught in it
8/26/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: But they weren‚Äôt freshmen!
8/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: That just makes it worse!
8/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Also, walking in the rain is fun
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: As long as you don't have a backpack or anything
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: I do like it
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: But it was a little chilly
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: You can also reinact sad movie scenes
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: And I was just in a dress
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: Oh, oh no
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: So got a lot of me pelted with rain drops
8/26/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: But hey at least I wasn‚Äôt soaked in sweat
8/26/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Are you usually soaked in sweat when you come home?
8/26/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: But tomorrow!  I have 6!  6!  Did you hear me!  6!  Hours of class tomorrow!
8/26/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: Yeah recently
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh Saturday night I smelled and felt so sweaty
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Sorry that‚Äôs gross but it was gross
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: OH GOD
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Tunnels and way too many young adults dancing to music
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: You know
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: SIX HOURS
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: YES
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh yeah that's sweaty for a different reason though
8/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: That's a fun type of sweaty imo
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: It's worse if it's just hot, wet air and you're in class or not doing anything
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: If you're dancing it's basically a workout
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I missed it so much!!!!
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I love dancing!!!
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Class isn‚Äôt usually sweaty
8/26/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Just walking
8/26/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: We should go to a club when I'm there/you're here!
8/26/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Oh for sure
8/26/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: I had a ton of fun at the bar, in case you couldn't tell from the million snapchat
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm already looking for plans for when you get here
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: I feel like it's just a place that F really can't compete with
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: Oh well
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: I usually have too much fun to even take snapchats
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: What!  That good!
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Honestly yeah
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: And don't tell me that F is better than the ruin bar
8/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: F has nostalgia though
8/26/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: And a crowd I that
8/26/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Trust**
8/26/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: That's fair
8/26/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: But also UNDERGROUND BARS
8/26/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: AND GOOD ALCOHOL
8/26/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: You have underground bars too?
8/26/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/26/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: #twinning
8/26/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: They're not super underground though
8/26/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: I have had good alcohol
8/26/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Although not too much of it!
8/26/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Yaaaay good habits
8/26/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Go you
8/26/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: What are you doing tonight?
8/26/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Did I tell you this is good decisions semester?
8/26/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Yes
8/26/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: And well Netflix and shower and sleep early because I have class at 9?
8/26/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Yes you did
8/26/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: GOODDECISIONSEMESTER
8/26/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: I tried telling marion to also and she didn‚Äôt respond...
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: #GoodDecisionsOnly
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: So she may not play along
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: #OkayMaybeNotOnly
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: #JustLikeOneOrTwo
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: #badones
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: No I don‚Äôt like bad decisions
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Good to hear, just don't put too much pressure on yourself
8/26/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like regretting things
8/26/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Like really don‚Äôt
8/26/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Usually i never regret things
8/26/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: Pssssh there are some bad decisions that you can not regret
8/26/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: Like just _one more_ piece of chocolate
8/26/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: But this semester the number of regrettable things has increased quite a bit and I‚Äôd like to go back to marianna from before
8/26/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Also, would you want to call tonight? I'm pretty much finished up with homework
8/26/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs not a _bad_ decision
8/26/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Sure!  I have some stories from Scotland and one from Vienna I had written down to tell you about but forgot!
8/26/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Can I shower and get in bed first?
8/26/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah! I might do the same
8/26/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Throw on some PJs
8/26/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: PJ PJ PJ PJ
8/26/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY
8/26/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: Oh I'm so so so so cozy now
8/26/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: Heeeeeck yea
8/26/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Does that mean your in bed and ready to call?
8/26/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: Because I am!
8/26/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: 10 minutes?
8/26/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: I'm doing a housecall on a laptop
8/26/19, 8:54 PM - Marianna: Okie smokie
8/26/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Surgery finished
8/26/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Operation unsuccessful
8/26/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Missed voice call
8/26/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: Paging dr Grenko unless there‚Äôs more post surgery stuff to do
8/26/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: Must take care of the patient first I totally understand
8/26/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah sorry it's not booting now
8/26/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I don't think there's much I can do though so I'm heading out
8/26/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: :(
8/26/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: You make-a me pout-a
8/26/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Come on that was COMEDY GOLD
8/26/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Hey sorry one last thing, can I count on flying out of Budapest to China on October 13?
8/26/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: Spyros wants actual details about arrangements
8/26/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I don't need flight numbers or times or exact days, but we need a preliminary budget and I need to know if I'm looking for a flight from Budapest or Copenhagen
8/27/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: Sorry I kid you not I think I was already asleep by then
8/27/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: But yes!  Whatever works best for you price wise/timing wise!
8/27/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Oh and I woke up this morning to the sound of SHATTERING glass. There‚Äôs construction in the square outside but it sounded like it was closer but I have yet to figure out what it is
8/27/19, 8:18 AM - Caleb: Okay
8/27/19, 8:18 AM - Caleb: First off
8/27/19, 8:19 AM - Caleb: That's incredible how fast you fell asleep
8/27/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Second off, awesome! I'll budget with the idea of flying out of Budapest then, maybe I could even get work to pay for my ticket to Budapest!
8/27/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: And third
8/27/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: :(
8/27/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: I hope that it wasn't in your apartment
8/27/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Because that's be SPOOKY man
8/27/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt stepped on any glass yet
8/27/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: So probably not
8/27/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: I also heard it like 3 separate times so it would be a lot of glass
8/27/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: Also coffee was not in expensive :(
8/27/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: So I guess I‚Äôll deal with instant coffee
8/27/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: But this mokka is good
8/27/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: :(
8/27/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Get just a coffee filter and a funnel
8/27/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: That's what I always did at home
8/27/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: Also that's good
8/27/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: I can tell you from (recent) personal experience that stepping on broken glass in the morning is a good way to wake up, but still not recommended
8/27/19, 9:33 AM - Caleb: Oh my word
8/27/19, 9:33 AM - Caleb: Getting off the metro, I saw a bunch of tiny children boarding the train in a school group
8/27/19, 9:34 AM - Caleb: And they were all wearing matching hats
8/27/19, 9:34 AM - Caleb: It was absolutely adorable
8/27/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: 1.5/6 hours of class done
8/27/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: I think I may just learn how to make good instant coffee
8/27/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna get honey
8/27/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: I really enjoyed my coffee and honey and milk the other day
8/27/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: But wow that does sound adorable!  Has school started there for the younger levels and high school?
8/27/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: Or idk you may not know I don‚Äôt know about in Hungary
8/27/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/27/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Oh no
8/27/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: That's a lot of class
8/27/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: I've got one more today, but then _sorta_ no class tomorrow
8/27/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: And I'm not really sure
8/27/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: I don't think I've seen many high-schoolers
8/27/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: But also I haven't really been looking for them
8/27/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Woah
8/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: I just learned that in Philly, theres a library that you can borrow specialty cake pans
8/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: I should have TOTALLY taken advantage of that
8/27/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Oh well, should-a could-a would-a I guess
8/27/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Well I am halfway done now
8/27/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre about to start again
8/27/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: And sorta no class?
8/27/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: AND WHAT THATS PHENOMENAL?!
8/27/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs it called and how did you find out?
8/27/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: Well its just in the Philly library system, but the picture I saw was in Kensington
8/27/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: I'd imagine since the Philly library system is so connected, it wouldn't really make a difference which one you go to
8/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: And yeah! Sorta no class
8/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Wednesdays are "field study days", so basically classes occasionally have field trips on those days
8/27/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: They're typically like 2-3 hours, and tomorrow I'm going to a hospital for my cancer class
8/27/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: What that‚Äôs so dope for philly to do that
8/27/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Ah yes you told me about the field trips
8/27/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: What do you do if two classes want to do field trips on the same day?
8/27/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: And woah that‚Äôs still a fun if possibly depressing field trip. Is it like shadowing doctors or do you know what you‚Äôll be doing?
8/27/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: And guess who survived all the days of classes!
8/27/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Hours**
8/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: I'd imagine they're pretty accommodating
8/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: I think it's just kinda going in and seeing what the Danish medical system looks like on a personal level
8/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: And wait you??
8/27/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Was that the last class??
8/27/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôd imagine they know there may be conflicts
8/27/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Depends on how many field trips each class does I guess
8/27/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: And well no
8/27/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: I just got through the 6-hour day
8/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Still have about 9 more hours of strict class
8/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: And plenty of other activities
8/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Closing ceremony for this part isn‚Äôt until next Thursday
8/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: It's like 3 at most per class
8/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: So there's some conflict, but most of the time it's just worked out
8/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: What are you up to?
8/27/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds like pretty good odds
8/27/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: Take a guess!
8/27/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: What am I always doing at this time of day
8/27/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: Cooooking?
8/27/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: That or napping
8/27/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: Both pretty safe bets tbh
8/27/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: Actually no
8/27/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: Gossip girl
8/27/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: THE HIDDEN THIRD OPTION
8/27/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: I feel like napping though
8/27/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: This was a recent one though so I think I get a pass
8/27/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôll have to go to bed early tonight
8/27/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Yes that is true
8/27/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: I really pulled one over on you

8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Okay I have 0 hope of topping that
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Ha
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: I cheated though...
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: _GASP_
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Honor code? Uh hello?
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Not official college business
8/27/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Thats not very cash money of you
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Dr. Cat would be sad
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Hey no harm no foul
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Mr. Dr. Cat that is
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: I utilized a resource I was not explicitly banned from using
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Well you've really pulled the wool over one's eyes'd on me
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Or implicitly I might add
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: I do that
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Wait
8/27/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: That list reminded me
8/27/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: Have you ever heard the Buffalo sentence
8/27/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think so?
8/27/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo
8/27/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Basically the idea is that you can make an entire grammatically correct sentence solely out of the world "buffalo"
8/27/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: What
8/27/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Buffalo is a city in New York
8/27/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Buffalo is an animal
8/27/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: And buffalo is a verb
8/27/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Thus
8/27/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: A verb?
8/27/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo
8/27/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's literally in the thesaurus list you sent me
8/27/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: So, buffLO
8/27/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: WHAT
8/27/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: now I‚Äôve bamBOOZLED mySELF
8/27/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Hey it makes more sense than the chicken thing
8/27/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: CHCIKEN?
8/27/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: sorry forgot caps were on
8/27/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: Chicken?
8/27/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Give that a good read
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Wow that took me all of 30 seconds to read
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Cool
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: I mean I got the gist of it surprisingly easily
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Can you do a one paragraph summary then? I didn't bother
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: CHCIKEN
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the summary
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Chicken chicken?
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt even need a paragraph
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: No no
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Just
8/27/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Chicken
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Chicken _chicken_ chicken?
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: No
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Caleb
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre not _listening_
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Just
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Chicken
8/27/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Look I'm not sure I follow, but it's above my pay grade anyway
8/27/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: Chicken
8/27/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/WAlWrT5P2VI
8/27/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: Wonderful wonderful show
8/27/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: I hope it was a happy chicken
8/27/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: YES
8/27/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: I mean that‚Äôs the only episode I‚Äôve seen
8/27/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve talked about this
8/27/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Oh 100%
8/27/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Oh Oregon
8/27/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: What a beautiful, weird, strange place
8/27/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: So
8/27/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: Would you recommend gossip girl? I lost track of the last show I was trying to watch
8/27/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Like you!
8/27/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Also isn‚Äôt weird and strange redundant
8/27/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: No
8/27/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Part of me hates it
8/27/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: I like the drama
8/27/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre awful people
8/27/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: And you don‚Äôt entirely strike me as a high school high society New York girl drama show
8/27/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: Oh good lord
8/27/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: I just ran to the corner store to get ice cream because it's a beautiful summer day right now
8/27/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: And so far, I've ran into 6 Davidson people
8/27/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Its literally RIGHT across from the street
8/27/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: Woah
8/27/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs kind of insane
8/27/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: I also kind of wish I had that
8/27/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: So sarah and Ryan (year above us at davidson) we‚Äôre talking about this meme and it came up in a lab meeting with dr r
8/27/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: And he sent them this
8/27/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs dr r
8/27/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: Taking pictures
8/27/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: And getting bitten by a monkey
8/27/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Thought you‚Äôd like to know you and your advisor are more similar than you might think apparently
8/27/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Update
8/27/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: 8
8/27/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Any of my friends yet?
8/27/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: Well
8/27/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: No
8/27/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Like have you seen Margaux or marion yet?
8/27/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: So far, Emily Juel, Nikki, Liddy, Anna, Liang, Anthony, and two more but I forget
8/27/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: And no
8/27/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: I've seen Marion like 3 times in adding
8/27/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Passing
8/27/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: And Margaux once
8/27/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Oh woah
8/27/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs basically all of our class
8/27/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Kidding
8/27/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: But it feels like a good portion
8/27/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: Is it comforting to see davidson people?
8/27/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/27/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: Well
8/27/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: It's a mixed feeling
8/27/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: I'm not super super close with many people here
8/27/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: But I should use it as a chance to get to know them more
8/27/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: But part of me honestly wishes that I went to a place with less Davidson kids
8/27/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: I do well if I'm out of my element, and idk, I guess it just feels too comfortable if I'm surrounded by Davidson people
8/27/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah maybe it‚Äôs the universe putting you somewhere to talk to those people!
8/27/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: I like comfort
8/27/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Wish I had my friends or just more people like me
8/27/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: After this summer of roommate and knowing people, I just realized there is something about davidson people that I love to be around and not so much about non davidson people
8/27/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: The people I‚Äôve met as a whole haven‚Äôt been like davidson people
8/27/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: Some have been super great
8/27/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: Robin
8/27/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: There are some bsm guys that go to Carlton that seem nice
8/27/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I totally get that
8/27/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: And I think that honestly I like the Davidson people a lot more than non Davidson people too
8/27/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: (for the most part)
8/27/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: But at the same time, it makes me less adventurous
8/27/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: Because I'm comfortable and feel like I don't need to go out, or make new friends, or talk to as many new people and get to know them
8/27/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: My issue with Davidson people here isn't the people, it's that it makes me want to fall back into the Davidson routine of school, work, eat, sleep, repeat
8/27/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: Caleb you do realize you are so much better at meeting new people than most people I know
8/27/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: You just talk
8/27/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: And introduce yourself
8/27/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: And listen
8/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: And make connections and friendships with people
8/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: From the sound of it, it doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôve fallen back into that routine
8/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: And I think you can avoid that pattern if you want to
8/27/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Aw
8/27/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Well thank you
8/27/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: It's not really hard, people are usually really interesting
8/27/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: All I do I sit there quietly and ask questions, and try to learn what I can I guess
8/27/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: Also, COPENHAGEN HAS ICE CREAM TRUCKS, WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME
8/27/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: It's okay though because now I have my own ice cream stache
8/27/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs good because you did off your real Stacie
8/27/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Stache **
8/27/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Well jokes on you because now I have an ice cream MUStache, mostly because I just ate some
8/27/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Good for you
8/27/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm eating dinner now
8/27/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Okay yeah that was a stretch of a joke my b
8/27/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: What's on the menu?
8/27/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Hmm chicken piccata again
8/27/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll cook something new tomorrow
8/27/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Fair fair
8/27/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: I had tomato, basil, egg, and cheese on an open face sandwich again
8/27/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: And then I took a nap, and woke up and wanted PURE junk food
8/27/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: So I put an egg in ramen, ate it, and then went on a quest for ice cream
8/27/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Oooooh
8/27/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: I was really hungry when we got home and then I had junk food but then it was dinner time but I wasn‚Äôt all that hungry at that point
8/27/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: So didn‚Äôt eat too much good food
8/27/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: And I hate it
8/27/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: I want sarah to get here
8/27/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: It's a lot more fun cooking for other people than just yourself
8/27/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: I definitely care about what I cook a lot more that way
8/27/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very self conscious about it
8/27/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: When I cook for other people
8/27/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: Like even things I‚Äôve made a million times
8/27/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Like what IF this time I mess it up and look like a fool
8/27/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I was going to go to some live music tonight at a bar/restaurant in our district
8/27/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: But thought I‚Äôd actually wait and save that for Sarah
8/27/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Because she comes in a week!
8/27/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: She thinks she‚Äôs just gonna see me when she gets to the apartment
8/27/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: BUT I just emailed AIT who picks the students up from the airport and asked if I could surprise her there instead and then ride back with the AIT van
8/27/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: And then I‚Äôm gonna take her to that restaurant for dinner that night with some hopefully good live music for her
8/27/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Because I think that‚Äôs EXACTLY the kind of first day she wants
8/27/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: And she already said she would chug coffee and stay awake for the first day to hang out with me
8/27/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: ONE
8/27/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: WEEK
8/27/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: !!!
8/27/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Gosh darn
8/27/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: You're like the best friend ever
8/27/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: That sounds like such a fun day
8/27/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Yall are gonna have such a blast
8/27/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: I try to be
8/27/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Well see if I can pull it off
8/27/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve also been brainstorming a few things to do while you‚Äôre here
8/27/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: But those will also be kept a secret
8/27/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Mwahahaha üòàüòà
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Ooooooo
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Exciting
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: :)
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Hey hey hey don‚Äôt get too excited it might be a major let down
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: No getting hopes up
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Pssssssh
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: If I'm hanging out with you in Budapest, I'm pretty sure a letdown is impossible
8/27/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Or I lock you in a room and don‚Äôt let you see Budapest for fear of it not being good enough
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: No no I‚Äôll be out
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll be locked awa
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: AHAHAHA
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: I was gonna say
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Mwahahaha üòà
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Kidding this place is pretty cool
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Even if I don‚Äôt plan it well
8/27/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Being locked in a room with you doesn't sound too bad, could be fun in the right conditions üòâ
8/27/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Oh don‚Äôt think about it too much you
8/27/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Well
8/27/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/27/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Hahaha
8/27/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs about all the reaction I expected
8/27/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: What can I say
8/27/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Sometimes I just run out of quips
8/27/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: No!  Can pigs fly!
8/27/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Especially when a little flustered
8/27/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Oh you
8/27/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Flustered?  You?
8/27/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: To pull a line from your script
8/27/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: What?  Do I flusters you?
8/27/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: And of course there‚Äôs a typo
8/27/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Woah that's from MY script? I didn't even know I had a script
8/27/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: It was too much hope for me to be able to pull that line off without a typo
8/27/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Well you claim you have lines
8/27/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: And won‚Äôt say if you‚Äôve pulled them on me
8/27/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: But I know you‚Äôve pulled that one on me
8/27/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: So it must be one of your lines
8/27/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Well I don't think it was one of them
8/27/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: Tbh I just speak my heart, it's worked so far so hey!
8/27/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: Now THATS a line
8/27/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: NOPE
8/27/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Swear to God it isn't
8/27/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: I think you're overestimating my luck with women
8/27/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: Yes I think I am
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: What, you think I'm a suave one?
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: FLATTERED
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Yes
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: We both know that's false
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Nope
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: You've seen how INCREDIBLY clumsy I am
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôre remarkably suave
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Yes but surprisingly not in bed
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: ...
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/27/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: üò≥
8/27/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Just wanna say
8/27/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Uh
8/27/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Thank you for providing me with another great emoji
8/27/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: It's been like four times in bed
8/27/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Low sample number
8/27/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Oh shoot you right
8/27/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Woah I totally forgot
8/27/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Well I guess I‚Äôll say I was impressed on night 1
8/27/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Impressed you managed to get through ALL of princess and the frog
8/27/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Without too much awkwardness
8/27/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: :)
8/27/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: No
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Also, I'd like to remind you how many times you accidentally kneed me
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: What does it mean
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: :(
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: I am not suave
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: It means, Marianna, that practice makes perfect
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: So
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not my fault
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Uh I think that is actually your fault
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Not my clumsiness!
8/27/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: You of all people should know!
8/27/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry though
8/27/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll get better
8/27/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Practice and all that
8/27/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: ‚ò∫Ô∏è
8/27/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Again, I don't think I've got a quip for that one
8/27/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd say I swear I‚Äôm not usually that clumsy
8/27/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: But I am
8/27/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: But weirdly enough I didn‚Äôt think so in bed
8/27/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: But again I‚Äôll claim either flustered or time off
8/27/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: Probably flustered
8/27/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: :)
8/27/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: I'll give you a pass
8/27/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: But also, apparently we've got a _couple_ things to get around to
8/27/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: *cough cough * a certain survey
8/27/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm sure we can find something to do
8/27/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: And yes I need to learn a bout this survey
8/27/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Aboot
8/27/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Aboot
8/27/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: And hey it‚Äôs still on you that we didn‚Äôt do that in Philly!
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Or maybe I had something to do with that
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Or the double bottle of wine
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: We've got to start another list ;))))
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: A list of words I say weird
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Not kinky but I think it's important to consolidate
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: There ain‚Äôt enough paper in the world for that lost
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: List**
8/27/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Ooooof
8/27/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Bolth cruel and accurate
8/27/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: :)
8/27/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure how consolidating can be kinky so yeah?
8/27/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: But Marianna, consolidating IS my kink
8/27/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: And UH Yeah you might have had something to do with not taking that quiz, something was distracting me
8/27/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm not sure how to work with that
8/27/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: But yeah uh something
8/27/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Construction probably
8/27/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhhyeahsure
8/27/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Also, I just want to be very clear
8/27/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: I don't have "routine lines" that I've used again and again and am now using on you
8/27/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: It's true I've got some lines, they're all pretty much limited to things like "don' worry about it", "my man", or other dumb, benign things like that
8/27/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: I just don't want you to think that this is routine, or that you're just an iteration of a regular thing for me
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Oh I was mostly joking
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: I believe you
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: You're pretty dang far from that
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: Aha okay
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: I just wanted to make sure
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Still good to hear it
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm mostly just kidding when I say things like that
8/27/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: You know
8/27/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: Because you‚Äôre part of my bad boy phase üòâ
8/27/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: KIDDING
8/27/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: you‚Äôre too sweet for that
8/27/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: I think
8/27/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: I hope
8/27/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: Marianna
8/27/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: I hope I'm the asteroid that kills all the dinosaurs
8/27/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: But the dinosaurs is just your bad boy phase
8/27/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: DONT YOU DARE TOUCH THE DINOSAURS
8/27/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: TRY AND STOP ME
8/27/19, 8:09 PM - Marianna: I WILL
8/27/19, 8:09 PM - Marianna: nah the bad boy phase is gone
8/27/19, 8:09 PM - Marianna: Or at least dormant
8/27/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: Hopefully just gone
8/27/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: SO MERCY ON THE DINOSAURS
8/27/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Rip to all the dinosaur homies
8/27/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Sorry guys
8/27/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: I'm comin for ya
8/27/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: NOOOOO
8/27/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: LET THEM LIVE
8/27/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: But if I do, you'll think I'm a pushover, so IMPAAAAACCT
8/27/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: NO
8/27/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Besides, gotta kick off the human era right or something
8/27/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: SPARE THEM
8/27/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: THEYVE GONE THROUGH ENOUGH
8/27/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: wait are you claiming to be the human era?
8/27/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: ... Uh
8/27/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: You know I wasn't thinking that far ahead
8/27/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/27/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: Have fun in the cold ages my dude
8/27/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: UUHHHHHHHHHH oh well
8/27/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Because the cold never bothered me anyway~~~
8/27/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been!
8/27/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: Good! Classes were fun
8/27/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: I really like bolth of the ones I have on this day
8/27/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: ... Holy shit I didn't even try that
8/27/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: IT'S IN MY THUMBS NOW
8/27/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: OH NO
8/27/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: But classes were really interesting! The History of Copenhagen one was fun because we just talked about the start of Copenhagen, which is pretty interesting. And then in Nordic Mythology, we didn't cover too too much, but hes really fun and I feel like I learn a lot of random stuff in that class
8/27/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Oh no I‚Äôm sorry Caleb this is bad news
8/27/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: But this sounds like a fun class!
8/27/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: So not to assume but today is a lighter day than the ethics and cancer class day?
8/27/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Honestly not really
8/27/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: But it's mostly because with medical stuff, it's my field of comfort
8/27/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: So I'm not saying I'm not going to learn anything, but right now it's review for me, and also is a way of thinking that I'm used to
8/27/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: These ones kinda keep me on my toes
8/27/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: But are still enjoyable
8/27/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: Oh that makes sense
8/27/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: My writing class was definitely the hardest one I‚Äôve had at davidson
8/27/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: Hated every minute of it
8/27/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Which one did you have? I didn't like mine either
8/27/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: It's the worst grade I've gotten here, and I actually enjoy writing too
8/27/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: The ethical diet
8/27/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Azella was in it
8/27/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: And me too
8/27/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: #watchmepassfail
8/27/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Oh my God
8/27/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: I remember she _hated_ that class
8/27/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: She always talked about how insane the professor was
8/27/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: And how the class discussions were ludicrous
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: YES
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: YES
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: YES
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: oh it was the worst
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: In a windowless classroom
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: In 3RD WATSON
8/27/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: You'll appreciate this rn, and I totally don't want to interrupt
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Azella really seemed to know what was up in class though
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Okay go for it
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: But my entire flat agrees that Frozen is overrated
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: YES
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: Just thought you should know
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: TELL THEM I LOVE THEM
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: THEYARE SO RIGHT
8/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: I SUPPORT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM
8/27/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Did the Danes see the movie in English?  Or Danish?
8/27/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: /is it any better in Danish
8/27/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: I think they saw it in English
8/27/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Everyone speaks English here, so there's really no point in translating
8/27/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: It would just lose nuance
8/27/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah, also, my discover weekly playlist this week is pure comfy gold
8/27/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: There are so many great ones in here
8/27/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/715yOhntcGELY9gb5rrSTl?si=OPpO5XD3QTe9dv40FMj07g
8/27/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Listen to that
8/27/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Mine is not great this week
8/27/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: So I will
8/27/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: Okay well this song followed your song based on your song and I like it al lot

8/27/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: I like it a lot
8/27/19, 9:14 PM - Caleb: It's got some fun strings in it
8/27/19, 9:14 PM - Caleb: I'm a sucker for fun strings
8/27/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcMR50ZgGjOi0?si=pCA_HepXSMuv1fqjnCABpw
8/27/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: Here, I think you'll like a bulk of it
8/27/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: Okay
8/27/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs only fair
8/27/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: You do have mine
8/27/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Oh naturally
8/27/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Also, I walked upstairs and now we're watching the end of Mama Mia 2
8/27/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Update my throat hurts
8/27/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Which is annoying
8/27/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: You can‚Äôt see the end!
8/27/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: You haven‚Äôt even seen the first movie sober
8/27/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like the end of mama Mia 2
8/27/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like Cher
8/27/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: Well
8/27/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: (Ignore that if Cher hasn‚Äôt shown up yet)
8/27/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: I just want you to know that I find you visually attractive
8/27/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I feel like there‚Äôs a ...but coming
8/27/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Brutal
8/27/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: But true!
8/27/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: It was a line in the movie and I wanted to see how it works
8/27/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/27/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: That makes more sense
8/27/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I was like he‚Äôs not drinking and I‚Äôm not upset so idk why he‚Äôs complimenting me
8/27/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: And see!  Lines!
8/27/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Do I not compliment you sober?
8/27/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: No I guess you do
8/27/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Just not as bluntly as ‚ÄúI find you visually attractive‚Äú
8/27/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: Oooo
8/27/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: I guess I can work on that then :))
8/27/19, 9:53 PM - Caleb: However
8/27/19, 9:53 PM - Caleb: I do also find you very visually attractive, I'd just phrase it a lil differently
8/27/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Ha feel free to you‚Äôre just gonna make me blush uncontrollably
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Ha
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: I can live with that
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: No!
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: It
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Will
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Kill
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: The
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Dinosaurs
8/27/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt stand it
8/27/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: Once again
8/27/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Oh? Well I say let the dinosaurs die, it's time for them to be fossils in the past :)
8/27/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: But I love my dinosaurs
8/27/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Okay, what are your dinosaurs here
8/27/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Are they still the bad boy phase
8/27/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Also, I really don't like the end of this movie
8/27/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like the end either
8/27/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: No
8/27/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre just dinosaurs now
8/27/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Ahaaaaaa
8/27/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/27/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Well they can stay then
8/27/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: So
8/27/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: YAY GOOD DINNOS
8/27/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Why will complements kill the poor dinosaurs then?
8/27/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I DONT KNOW
8/27/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: sorry forgot about the caps again
8/27/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: But that part doesn‚Äôt exactly follow o guess
8/27/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Alright well the dinos can definitely stay then
8/27/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Yeah this is sort of an odd movie
8/27/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Oh! I never asked, how was your day?
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Good!
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Lots of class
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: But we did fun things
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: I like learning languages I have realized
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll pick something else up when I get back to campus
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: If I have time
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: I may not have time
8/27/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll audit a language class
8/27/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: And then I went to try to get my yoga pass once again
8/27/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: But I think I‚Äôve realized these studios aren‚Äôt open 24/7 just like right before and after classes
8/27/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm going to register online and hope I can get a pass that way
8/27/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Jk read their website again and I‚Äôll just go a little early for class and get a pass then
8/27/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: The only thing that sucks is that I also have to go shopping and cook tomorrow
8/27/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: And the class is 7:30-9 so I‚Äôll be cooking AFTER 9
8/27/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Ah I actually just signed up for a fitness class
8/27/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I'm going with flatmates
8/27/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: And that's awesome! If you want I can teach you Chinese
8/27/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: I'd love to audit a language class, but I'm definitely already busy enough
8/27/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: I want to pick up as much Danish as I can here, but it's such a phonetically hard language that my motivation was DOA
8/27/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs fun!  I wish I could go with someone
8/27/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm flattered
8/27/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: And you can tell me fun word in Chinese if you‚Äôd like but that‚Äôs actually one of the languages I‚Äôm least interested in
8/27/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: Just don‚Äôt see myself going to China ever
8/27/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Although I realize it‚Äôs useful in the us too
8/27/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Italian is the one I would most like to learn
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: I'll be totally honest, I didn't have too much interest in going I China either
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: But like 1/3 of the global population speaks it, and most of them don't speak English
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Or German of all the ones at davidson
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: French has too much funny sounds
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: I've always wanted to get better at Swedish, my mom is really the only person around to practice with
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs a good thing going for it
8/27/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: Oh God
8/27/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: French
8/27/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's a tough one
8/27/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: I told my dad I‚Äôd try to do some Duolingo Italian and then we could call and practice
8/27/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs trying to teach himself
8/27/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: That would be awesome!
8/27/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Did your dad speak any Italian growing up?
8/27/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Little bits and pieces
8/27/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: The generation above him did
8/27/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Mostly Genoese which is the dialect of the region we the family is from
8/27/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: And all that trickled down to me was how to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough to eat‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI understand‚Äù
8/27/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Aka all that you need in an Italian household
8/27/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Haaaaa
8/27/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Is there no way of saying "Nonna I'm full"?
8/27/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: No those words don‚Äôt exist
8/27/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: We were warned that if we went to visit the family in Genova, the family just sits you down and gives your course after course even if you are super jet lagged
8/27/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: And there is no way to be like oh no thanks I‚Äôve had enough no need to make a 13 course meal for me
8/27/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Oh God how do you even survive that
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Italian families seem intense
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: They were on holiday when we visited
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I mean nonna does that to some extent
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: I got a couple stories from Jessica
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs generally desired
8/27/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Jessica?
8/27/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: One of the secretaries at Penn
8/27/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Oh right I remember her!
8/27/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Looked not 40
8/27/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: She would always come by and we would talk about music or being outsides in prep school or other random things
8/27/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: Yeah! That one!
8/27/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: I still can't believe that
8/27/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: But what stories did you hear from her?
8/27/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Well first off
8/27/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: She stressed to me that Italian families are cRaZy
8/27/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: I told her about you and her first question was "so how crazy is her family"
8/27/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Which isn't a great question to start with Jessica
8/27/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: But it was things like that, wild uncles, wacky siblings, and whatnot
8/27/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: And that her nonna NEVER stopped feeding them
8/27/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: "oh? You only ate one dinner?"
8/27/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Is something that apparently happened a lot
8/27/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: You say crazy we say fun
8/27/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Nonna is a big fan of dessert for breakfast
8/27/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Or dessert for a snack
8/27/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Or whatever we want to eat
8/27/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: She jokes that if we can find it we can eat it basically
8/27/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: And she really enjoys cooking for a large group
8/27/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: And when she does, she make 3-4 main dishes and have another few side dishes and options for veggies to try to make sure everyone has something they like
8/27/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Reunions are fun
8/27/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: We all get assigned roles
8/27/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: So when we were little, it was setting the table or coming up with the during dinner entertainment (we sang about milk on the old flatbed truck we use to haul grape as our stage) and later it was helping in the kitchen or going to pick veggies from the garden or checking to see how the bread cooking in the yellow house was doing
8/27/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: Because that‚Äôs right
8/27/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: Nonna only had one oven in the big house on the ranch
8/27/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: But there was the original house (yellow house because it was originally painted yellow) that was much smaller and walk down the driveway and she would split her time between the two kitchens or send a team down there during BIG dinner preps to use that one too
8/27/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: These are the stories that I sign up for
8/27/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: I also enjoy knowing that there's a building temporarily deemed "she-shed"
8/27/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Those dinners sound wonderful
8/27/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Probably very eventful too
8/27/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: Id like to imagine lively discussion
8/27/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Yes we‚Äôll see if the name sticks
8/27/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: We like to do very literal names soo fear it might not
8/27/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: But who knows with those California Ghirardelli‚Äôs they‚Äôre crazy
8/27/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: And yes always very eventful and very full of discussion
8/27/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Only a few quarrels
8/27/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Often involving my aunt Alice
8/27/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Or my mom and aunt Linda
8/27/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: They like to but heads
8/27/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: And Alice likes to butt heads with everyone
8/27/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: But it all usually ends well
8/27/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Lively discussions at your fam reunions?  Or you said they don‚Äôt happen as much right?
8/27/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/27/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Oh my
8/27/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: My family reunions are aaaalways an interesting time
8/27/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Lots of family drama
8/27/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: None of it fun
8/27/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: My dad has a small family, and the core of it is very wholesome and sweet
8/27/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: It's my dad, uncle Craig and his wife Carroll, and then their kids
8/27/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: And then theres uncle Dave
8/27/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Who just kinda had an abusive wife for a while, and finally divorced her
8/27/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: But it's still hyper toxic and very stressful for everyone
8/27/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: And then theres my MOMs family, and ooooh boy
8/27/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Basically, her and her oldest brother are the only ones that have their stuff together
8/27/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: And so they're the elders of the whole family, in an odd way
8/27/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: But there's just whacky uncles and cousins and it's slightly more wholesoken
8/27/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Wholesome'
8/27/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: But you bet there's a good bit of gossip
8/27/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: But hey family‚Äôs family
8/27/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: I feel like no matter what seeing them is still a trea
8/27/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Although I realize I‚Äôm very lucky to have the family I have
8/27/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm listening to your discover weekly playlist and playing nonograms and it is a very nice chill playlist
8/27/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah! It really is
8/27/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: It reminded me that I want to make an actual playlist with you
8/27/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Instead of just one that's a dump of all our songs
8/27/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Idk, I think it would be awesome to have basically a pillow talk playlist that we both will get to know by heart
8/27/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Something that if I hear one of the songs from it, I can't help but think of you
8/27/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: But hey, Im just a sucker for sentimentality I guess
8/27/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Also, I need to go to bed because I've got a FIELD TRIP! talk to you tomorrow, goodnight!
8/27/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: I am so very good with that
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: That is a good way to ruin songs for yourself though
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Or maybe not
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: But I definitely have memories tied to songs
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: still would love to
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: And yes I need to go to sleep as well
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm enjoying the music and the puzzles so we‚Äôll see about that
8/27/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
8/27/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Ah, well jokes on you
8/27/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Because I'd love to have memories of you associated with some songs :)
8/27/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: And goodnight!
8/27/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: fLUSTerEd aNd BlusHinG
8/28/19, 7:45 AM - Marianna: Uh say two of I don‚Äôt want to get up
8/28/19, 7:45 AM - Marianna: And I was gonna go to ikea and yoga today
8/28/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: But my throat still hurts so I may make excuses not to
8/28/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: Oh hello good morning
8/28/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: Day**
8/28/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: Good morning
8/28/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: Ooo that sounds not fun
8/28/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: Ikea is always a wild ride
8/28/19, 7:47 AM - Caleb: You think you're getting sick?
8/28/19, 7:50 AM - Marianna: I always answer no to that question because if I don‚Äôt admit it it isn‚Äôt true
8/28/19, 8:14 AM - Caleb: Okay
8/28/19, 8:14 AM - Caleb: Well that sorta makes sense
8/28/19, 8:15 AM - Caleb: Also
8/28/19, 8:15 AM - Caleb: This is super cool
8/28/19, 8:15 AM - Caleb: I got up with the city
8/28/19, 8:15 AM - Caleb: So the streets are empty
8/28/19, 8:15 AM - Caleb: Even the super touristy ones
8/28/19, 8:16 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: Oh woah that is cool
8/28/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: Did you have to be somewhere early or are you just wandering?
8/28/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: I'm heading to my field trip meeting place
8/28/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: It's hella early and in the other direction of where we're going, but still it was really cool to see
8/28/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs cool
8/28/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: I found some winter wakeup tea and it smells fantastic so we‚Äôll see if this helps me feel better
8/28/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: Is your field trip all day?
8/28/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: It's until 12
8/28/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: So like half day!
8/28/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: I'm done with homework for tomorrow though, I did it last night
8/28/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: So after that, Carpe diem, the day is mine
8/28/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: Woooooot woooot
8/28/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: Have a fun day then!
8/28/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: We think our day is only the morning too
8/28/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: Yeah
8/28/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: But like a high school half day
8/28/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: Not a college half day
8/28/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: So it's still a lot of work
8/28/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: What are you doing today?
8/28/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: Oh I miss high school half days
8/28/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: Because have I explained the mod system in high school to you?
8/28/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm becoming a resident of Hungary!
8/28/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: So we‚Äôre all going to the immigration office
8/28/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: I miss high school half day too man
8/28/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: There was SO much excitement if it ever started snowing in the morning, rumors would be flying all over the place
8/28/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: And no I don't think you have actually
8/28/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: Also, congrats! Welcome (officially) to Hungary or something
8/28/19, 9:36 AM - Marianna: Oh!  even we had those kind of excited whispers
8/28/19, 9:37 AM - Marianna: So each mod was 20 min with 2 minutes between them. Most classes were 2 mods but some were 3 mods (so 42 minute classes or 64 minute classes)
8/28/19, 9:38 AM - Marianna: But!  When we had half days, all the mods got squished so we we still had all 8 classes but they were all like 20 minutes
8/28/19, 9:38 AM - Marianna: It was so nice
8/28/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: AND IM A RESIDENT
8/28/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: HOORAY
8/28/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: We're also getting out early
8/28/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: But have a 45 minute commute
8/28/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Also that's weird
8/28/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: It feels like a waste of time to fit everything in 20 minutes
8/28/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Like, it took 5 minutes for us to get on topic, how much material would we really cover
8/28/19, 11:23 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm almost home
8/28/19, 11:23 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna nap I think
8/28/19, 11:23 AM - Marianna: Maybe drink some more tea
8/28/19, 11:23 AM - Marianna: What are the odds there is instant ramen in Hungary
8/28/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: And no it was kind of a waste
8/28/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: But it didn‚Äôt happen a lot
8/28/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: Usually like the last day of school or before a break
8/28/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: We had like 8 different adjusted mod schedules that we cycled through depending on what was happening that day
8/28/19, 11:25 AM - Marianna: What are your plans for the rest of the day?
8/28/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: Instant ramen? Very high
8/28/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: Very very high
8/28/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: Global phenomenon
8/28/19, 11:29 AM - Marianna: Update I stopped and grabbed a pastry in the metro for like a dollar we‚Äôll see if cheers me up
8/28/19, 11:29 AM - Marianna: Okay you say that but I haven‚Äôt seen it
8/28/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: I've seen a ton of ramen here in Copenhagen
8/28/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: But probably a little more of a multicultural city
8/28/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: Also, I really don't have plans the rest of the day
8/28/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: Maybe I'll go out and explore
8/28/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: Maybe I'll stay in and do laundry
8/28/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: Yeah I think the culture shock is actually the most felt in the stores or when looking at what Hungarians eat for me
8/28/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: There is VERY little that I recognize in stores
8/28/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: And some things are very much missing in my opinion
8/28/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhh yeah I gotcha
8/28/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: They have almost everything here
8/28/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: There's also just specialty Danish stuff
8/28/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: So it's pretty comfy but I'm trying to go be a lil adventurous
8/28/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think I‚Äôm gonna have to be adventurous
8/28/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: I may nap and home I feel better and maybe go to the market tongiht
8/28/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: For meat and veggies
8/28/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll look for a new risotto recipe with some protein in it so I can do it as a main course and not just a side
8/28/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: Update I think anne and I are better I just FaceTimed her because she‚Äôs in the hospital in Spain and pretty bored
8/28/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/28/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Oh man
8/28/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: A nap
8/28/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: That's exactly what I need
8/28/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: And why's Anne in a hospital in Spain?
8/28/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Is she okay?
8/28/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Oh nap nap
8/28/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna eat and then nap too
8/28/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Well the think with Anne is she‚Äôs always in the hospital and we rarely know why
8/28/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: And this time is no different
8/28/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: But it still sucks that‚Äôs she‚Äôs in a foreign city with no one
8/28/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôll be okay
8/28/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/28/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: I'm glad to hear that
8/28/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: That's gotta be a scary experience
8/28/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Gotta say, European hospitals are interesting
8/28/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: They feel different but I can't pinpoint how
8/28/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: I just hope all works out with insurance and whatnot
8/28/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs got one of the program assistants helping her and says the insurance is actually covering anything
8/28/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Which is amazing
8/28/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: Oh!  How was the hospital visit!  What‚Äôs a you guess get to do
8/28/19, 1:28 PM - Caleb: Well that's good
8/28/19, 1:28 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you also had a chance to FaceTime her, that probably made her feel a lot better
8/28/19, 1:29 PM - Caleb: And it wasn't a super super interesting hospital visit
8/28/19, 1:29 PM - Caleb: Our professors talked about their work, mostly immunology and oncologyb
8/28/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: And then we saw the immunology lab, and then the clinic
8/28/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: The lab and clinic felt about the same in practice as the US, but at the same time the general atmosphere of the hospital was very different
8/28/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: I hope so
8/28/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: And well it still was hopefully nice to experience something new and learn a little
8/28/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Do the professors do cool stuff?
8/28/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: Yeah! They both develop experimental treatments for cancer using the patients own immune system
8/28/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Which is waaaaaay more effective, more pleasant, and shorter than chemo
8/28/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: And honestly the biggest takeaway was the attitude of the Danes towards taxes
8/28/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: We actually talked with a couple patients, and they said that they're all happy to pay them
8/28/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: The biggest shoulder should have the heaviest burden
8/28/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: But it's just the price of living in that society, and they're happy with it
8/28/19, 1:48 PM - Marianna: Woah that treatment sounds so cool and so does that tax system
8/28/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: But sadly the people who could make those laws are the ones who would carry that heaviest burden so o doubt we‚Äôll ever see the day that we have a system like that
8/28/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: :(
8/28/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: And even if it did, I doubt people would LIKE it
8/28/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/28/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: The issue is that taxes and distribution of medical resources doesn't scale like that
8/28/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: Denmark is a tiny country with less than 5 million people, and the US is massive with almost 400 million with lots of rural land
8/28/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: It's easy to come here and say things are perfect, but they wouldn't apply to the US in any fashion
8/28/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: But! We have a lot of issues, and a lot to sort out, and no one should have to go bankrupt from medical care, ever
8/28/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: How's your day been so far?
8/28/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: Oh good point the scaling thing makes sense

8/28/19, 2:23 PM - Marianna: Bed helps
8/28/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: Although
8/28/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: The ice cream is gone
8/28/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: :(
8/28/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm gonna finish this episode, nap, and then go grocery shopping. Still probably won‚Äôt feel up for yoga but I can probably cook dinner tonight
8/28/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day!  What have you done since field trip?
8/28/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: Well
8/28/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: I just woke up from a tiny nap
8/28/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: Might go back for seconds
8/28/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: But basically I was heading back from the trip, went to the mall, went into a Danish homegoods store, and came back, got ice cream, napped, and here I am
8/28/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: I'm going to the gym later
8/28/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: So that'll feel good
8/28/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: And I want to go to the royal library, but maybe tomorrow would be better
8/28/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: Nap #2 was a success
8/28/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: I woke up and had no idea what day it was
8/28/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: I just had a chonky chonky nap
8/28/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: Nothing like a 2 hour on a Wednesday
8/28/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: And now I kind of don‚Äôt want to get up egain
8/28/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Look at that
8/28/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: #twinning
8/28/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: Yup
8/28/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: Okay now I need groceries
8/28/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: Whoo
8/28/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Wohooooo for grocery shopping
8/28/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs 93 DEGREES OUT
8/28/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: your adventure in the home hoods store looks fun!  Did you get anything or just there to look?
8/28/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: I just had some time to kill and I didn't get anything, but I saw a lot of fun things
8/28/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Mostly decorations
8/28/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Basically what I sent you were the highlights
8/28/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: It looked fun!
8/28/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: Very fun
8/28/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: Highly recommended
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Not quite Ikea though
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: If only I could find one
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Yeah didn‚Äôt get there today
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: Update idk if Hungary does FRESH herbs
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: All I could find are dried
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: And no liquid soup
8/28/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: So no chicken stock
8/28/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: So I bought bouillon cubes
8/28/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: Or I think that‚Äôs what they are
8/28/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: But I bought more cookies and ice cream so I can survive on that right
8/28/19, 6:01 PM - Marianna: And no ice coffee!
8/28/19, 6:06 PM - Marianna: I just got carded and not even like normal carded the guy asked if I was 16 but the drinking age is 18?
8/28/19, 6:06 PM - Marianna: I just showed him my id
8/28/19, 6:06 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt think I looked younger than 16!
8/28/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Or I‚Äôm actually thinking maybe he got his English numbers messed up
8/28/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: Surviving on cookies and ice cream is recommended
8/28/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: Ice cream beats the heat
8/28/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: I scream for ice cream, ya know
8/28/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: And WHAT
8/28/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: That's wild
8/28/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: You're smol, but you don't look young
8/28/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: At least not 16 young
8/28/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: Oh! And I'm at an activities fair right now
8/28/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: I'm probably joining an orchestra
8/28/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: And also I got a flyer for hot yoga which sounds like way more fun that I thought
8/28/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: I bought Napoleon
8/28/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôll have ice cream for all the moods
8/28/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Also would you still like updates from cooking with marianna?
8/28/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs in over her head tonight probably
8/28/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: But yay that‚Äôs so cool about the activities fair!  I wish we had a big enough campus and school that we had activities through the school
8/28/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: Did you bring your violin (who‚Äôs name I forgot please remind me)?
8/28/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: And yeah hot yoga is intense
8/28/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what I did last semester except in a normal degree room and it was hard enough like we sweat SOOOO much
8/28/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: Okay just text STOP to cancel subscription to Cooking with Marianna: Hungary
8/28/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Uh yes I would still like updates
8/28/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: CONTINUE
8/28/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: And no I didn't! They have one I can rent though, so I'll probably do that
8/28/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: They sounded like they needed first violins so maybe I could get it for free
8/28/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: And that looks delicious! Only one picture?
8/28/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Oh and his name is Augustus by the way
8/28/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Oh right right
8/28/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: I always think of fault in our stars
8/28/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Did you read or watch that movie?
8/28/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: And yes i know you‚Äôre wondering, it does smell fantastic
8/28/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: I read the movie duhh
8/28/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: It was like freshman year of high school?
8/28/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: ... Is hagyma an onion
8/28/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Also OH MY WORD BACON CARMELIZED ONION
8/28/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Oh lawd yes
8/28/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think around then
8/28/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: But actually did you read or watch it
8/28/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: And yes
8/28/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm practicing
8/28/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: So now we‚Äôre added the fokhagyma
8/28/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Fokhagyma = garlic?
8/28/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: And I totally watched it
8/28/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: At that point I don't think I read too much
8/28/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Yes!
8/28/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: And well there‚Äôs another movie we have
8/28/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Low key I want to go to Amsterdam partially due to that movie
8/28/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Rice, wine and I'm _guessing_ chicken stock
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Amsterdam is decent
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Which I made from bouillon cubes
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: You kinda get disillusioned when you get there though
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Not sure I did it right
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: I know! That‚Äôs what everyone says!
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: It's a lot more chaotic and commercial than you'd expect
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: But I think itd be fun photographically
8/28/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhh you're in it for the Instagram, _I see_
8/28/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: No
8/28/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: No
8/28/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Not me
8/28/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not that kind of photographer
8/28/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: Keep in mind that I did go to the red-light district though, and I was with my high school class, so I have a slightly tainted opinion probably
8/28/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: I think there are certainly people who are really good at Instagram photography but not me
8/28/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: What?  You went WITH your class?
8/28/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Oh you know it
8/28/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Teachers and all
8/28/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: I think we went to very different high schools didn't we
8/28/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Well I had a teacher who frequented brothels in Baltimore
8/28/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: But as a protest
8/28/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Wait whAT
8/28/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôd go and and sit there and observe
8/28/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: As a protest for what??
8/28/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: And you bet your bottle dollar no gentlemen are gonna show up when there‚Äôs a little old lady sitting in the front
8/28/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Most of the ones in Baltimore claim to be businesses
8/28/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: So like they‚Äôll be a massage shop
8/28/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: So she‚Äôll go in and ask for a massage
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: And everyone will be confused but the pimp can‚Äôt say oh we actually don‚Äôt do that here
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: And then she‚Äôd call the police
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: And tell them what she found
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt believe they were her biggest fans
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: That's wild
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: And sadly rarely listened to her
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Holy shit
8/28/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs the best religion teacher I‚Äôve ever had
8/28/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: She basically turned our senior year religion class into feminist class and teaching us about what we are about to face in the world as women
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Okay that's actually amazing
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Yeah and then they fired her
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Because that wasn‚Äôt ndps message
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Teachers like that
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Awhar
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: WHAT
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: NDP
8/28/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: BRUH
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: UNCOOL
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: In one of her rants, she said something critic about how the police didn‚Äôt act
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Teachers like that are really the best
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Oh?
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: And low and behold one of the girls in her class was a daughter of a high up police chief or something
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: And told her dad
8/28/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: And he said it was not her place
8/28/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Liberalism was always opposed by most students and their daddies
8/28/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: People tried to get the entire English department in trouble for showing up to school in black as in mourning after the election
8/28/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs like uh guys you were wearing trump shirts this morning before school started _on school property_
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: You can‚Äôt argue first amendment at that point
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Oh man
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs still legendary
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Teachers like that don't teach you school
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: They teach you life
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Everyone with sense knows the place isn‚Äôt as good without her
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Pretty much
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: And administrations hate it
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: She told us about the cleary reports when we were looking at schools
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: They kill their own schools
8/28/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: It's unfortunate
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: And a ton of other useful college tips
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Yup
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: See, those are the things you need to know
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Senior year was an incredible time for things like that
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Or learning like that
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre run by the Catholic Church and cater towards one of the only affluent conservative areas in Maryland
8/28/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Because no one cares about school, but you've got the biggest step in life right ahead of you
8/28/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Oh my God I'm so sorry
8/28/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: That sounds excruciating
8/28/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Yeah no so I‚Äôve kind of been a person a lot of people come to with issues related to assault drugging and things like that because I was told how to handle helping people going through that and like to be there for people
8/28/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Have I ever told you about my teacher that almost joined a convent?
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Which is hard but also I‚Äôm grateful she made us able to help our communities
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: No?
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Well
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Wait maybe
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: This conversation is gonna have to continue later
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: But tell me again I like listening to you
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Okay
8/28/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Because I'm working out with my flat right now
8/28/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: The class starts in a few minutes
8/28/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: But this is a really really good discussion
8/28/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: And I have so much to say about the wondful teachers in my life
8/28/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Oaky okay have fun!
8/28/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Oh I want to hear!
8/28/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: But later!
8/28/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Now, go work your butt off and have fun with flat mates!
8/28/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I am become death
8/28/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Just death
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Copenhagen crossfit communities are INTENSE
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: H O W E V E R
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: It's a cool night
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: There's a slight breeze
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: And I'm laying in the grass
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Covered in sweat
8/28/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: All is well
8/28/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: CrossFit?
8/28/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs intense in any country code
8/28/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: That sounds nice
8/28/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: Still with friends hopefully
8/28/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: Or you‚Äôre just a crazy person
8/28/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: Its dark there is it?
8/28/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah I was hanging with Reid
8/28/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: I'm inside now
8/28/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: And Norwegian Hana looked at me when I walked in, and said "you look broken"
8/28/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: And then gave me dark chocolate
8/28/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: And yeah it's dark
8/28/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Not pitch black, but it's dark enough
8/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Yay Reid!
8/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre bonding
8/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good to have a good roommate you want to hang out without outside of your room
8/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: And are you broken?
8/28/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: Well whatever the answer is, I believe chocolate would make life better
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: I feel broken
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: But only physically
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: So it's all good
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: Aw
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: :(
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: NO NO
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: It's all good
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: Physical broke is good sometimes
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: I'm dripping sweat
8/28/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: Yeah that is a nice feeling
8/28/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I will be VERY sore soon
8/28/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I almost typed out sober
8/28/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I'm also sober
8/28/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: And will be
8/28/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I just want to sleep though
8/28/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs also a nice feeling
8/28/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: Sober isn‚Äôt the BEST feeling
8/28/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not bad though
8/28/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: I support sleep
8/28/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I forgot to mention, the crossfit thing came out to only $50 for 3 months
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Woah that‚Äôs amazing
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: For real
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: It's meant to draw locals in
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs also like sadistic to do CrossFit
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: There's only one issue though
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Or is it masochistic
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Idk
8/28/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Wait what‚Äôs the issue I was joking
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: THE ENTIRE THING IS IN DANISH
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: HA
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: GIBBERISH
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: YOURE DOING GYM IN GIBBERISH
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Not just gibberish
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: DRUNKEN gibberish
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Wait what
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: It just sounds drunken
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: The way they talk
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: No one was drunk
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: I think
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Idk man but I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre supposed to work out sober
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Got it
8/28/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: However
8/28/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah that would make understanding any language harder
8/28/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: I did feel like I was gonna throw up a little at the end
8/28/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Too many carbs today
8/28/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: I DIDN'T THOUGH!
8/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Oh no
8/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Good
8/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Not great
8/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the worst feeling
8/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: What would you say the best feeling in the world is?
8/28/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Getting a genuine compliment from someone you respect a lot
8/28/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: That's what my best feeling in the world is
8/28/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: What about you?
8/28/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs a really good one
8/28/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Idk
8/28/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: I get these moments where I‚Äôm just stuck in awe at where I am
8/28/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Like it can be walking across Davidson‚Äôs campus at 2am
8/28/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: But I just smile
8/28/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs like woah
8/28/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm here
8/28/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm so good with it
8/28/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: https://open.spotify.com/track/1aO2xV0zk2Jrx1iFDvlV8L?si=Lsjh8I_WQcW1nmwlGHSbJA
8/28/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like the song itself
8/28/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: But I like the metaphor of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre breakfast in bed‚Äù
8/28/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Update Joey has done 4/4 nights of week of champions
8/28/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Joeeyyyyy
8/28/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: That's about when I tapped out I think
8/28/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: And AWWWW
8/28/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: That's a perfect moment
8/28/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: I've had those a good bit recently
8/28/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: It's just a sudden feeling of "life is wonderful, I'm glad to be here"
8/28/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: You did week of champions?!
8/28/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Actually I remember you saying that at some point
8/28/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: But yes exactly!
8/28/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Soooo tell me about your favorite teacher!
8/28/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Oh did you see Sabrina schamroths latest insta post?
8/28/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: I don't think I know Sabrina
8/28/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: And okay
8/28/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: So
8/28/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Ive had a lot of teachers I really liked
8/28/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: But freshman year of high school, public school
8/28/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: Mr Kindt, my geometry and programming teacher
8/28/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: I ABSOLUTELY messed around in the class
8/28/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Didn't pay attention
8/28/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Sat in the back
8/28/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Played games on the computer
8/28/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Goofed off with other students
8/28/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: And just was a terrible student in general
8/28/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: But he believed in me, and payed special attention to me, and I actually kinda started caring
8/28/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I'd start doing the assignment, then get bored, then just mess around and change it to do more fun things
8/28/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: But anyway, he just actually talked to me, and got me to care, and believed in me
8/28/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: But then I wanted to leave etown, and he wrote my letter of recommendation
8/28/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: And I got a scholarship, so I left
8/28/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: And he just kinda followed up every once in a while, or I'd pop by etown
8/28/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Oh she‚Äôs in warner
8/28/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: She posted a bunch of pretty pictures from Sweden
8/28/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: But that teacher sounds amazing
8/28/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I actually emailed him on the first day that I taught the bioinformatics AT session, and basically thanked him for everything
8/28/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Because without him, I'm pretty sure I'd never have done anything with my life
8/28/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs such an amazing connection
8/28/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: I would have been happy with not caring, and just scraping by like I'd always done
8/28/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Teachers really should get paid more considering how much they can impact children‚Äôs lives
8/28/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/28/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: It's criminal the things they have to do
8/28/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: It's definitely something you only go into if it's something you're passionate about
8/28/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Or you should only if you‚Äôre passionate about it
8/28/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve also had some teachers who seem to hate children
8/28/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/28/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/28/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I've definitely had those too
8/28/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Not recently though
8/28/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: But I have definitely asked "why are you even teaching?"
8/28/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Like literally asked them?!
8/28/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Oh GOODNESS no I'm not that balsy
8/28/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Okay I think I did that to one teacher actually
8/28/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: But it was kinda heated
8/28/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: CALEB
8/28/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: okay what‚Äôs the most rebellious thing you did in a classroom?
8/28/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: How heated are we talking here
8/28/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/28/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Oh no
8/28/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: I don't know if I can remember anything super super specific
8/28/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: OH GOD YES I CAN
8/28/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: I had an orchestra conductor one time, and I was concert master at the time
8/28/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: And there were DEFINITELY kids much older than me in the orchestra
8/28/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: But I had trouble keeping rhythm because it was sort of an odd piece, and it was just a really bad day in general for me
8/28/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: But my orchestra conductor, in front of the whole group, starts scolding me about not being able to count the rhythms right
8/28/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: OH WAIT no, the issue is that I wasn't holding the sections together
8/28/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: So to make sure I was following her conducting, she conducts the section again, but in the middle randomly slows her conducting to a crawl without announcing it first
8/28/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: And I wasn't paying close attention, so I miss the tempo change
8/28/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: And she starts railing into me in front of the whole orchestra, and I'm on the verge of tears
8/28/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: So I yell back "WELL MAYBE IT WOULD BE EASIER IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A SHITTY CONDUCTOR"
8/28/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: And she looked like she wanted to slap me, and then just walks out of the orchestra, and leaves
8/28/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: It was a couple days before the concert too
8/28/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: So yeah, that's probably the most heated I've been with a teacher
8/28/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: We actually ended up being pretty close though, I've got lots of fun stories with her
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Oh that is not a cool move gotta say
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: But it was pretty unfair for her
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Also what is concert master?
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: First chair first violin
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Important if I know anything!
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Basically the person in command of the orchestra directly under the conductor
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Or just that first chairs are important
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Thats so cool!
8/28/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's the liason between the conductor and the actual orchestra playing
8/28/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Oh wow
8/28/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: I've got some other interesting stories with her
8/28/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Like how I made up with her!
8/28/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: We got a teacher fired pretty much because she was awful and she knew we disliked her and so she would routinely cry after our class
8/28/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: How?
8/28/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Well
8/28/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: It wasn't long after that
8/28/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: And what happened was we still didn't have our stuff together
8/28/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: And so we were all supposed to go home and practice, but naturally a handful didn't
8/28/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: So, it's like a Friday afternoon, our concert is that Saturday, and it's the last period of the day
8/28/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: We can NOT get this one section to sound good, so she (justifiably) blows up at the people in it, and storms out because it's falling apart
8/28/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: (she wasn't super mature)
8/28/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: But the kids that couldn't play were violins, and this is important later
8/28/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: So, after she storms out, the room is dead silent, and Im like "okay, guess rehearsal is over", and just dismiss everyone that was doing well
8/28/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Then kept behind people that needed more practice, and stayed after school with them for like an hour just drilling sections they needed help with, and then got them to clean up the orchestra room and put all the stands away
8/28/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: And our director comes to me the next day before the concert, and says she heard what I did, thanked me for it, and we were pretty cool from then on out
8/28/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Oh that was pretty impressive for you to do
8/28/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: How old were you at the time?
8/28/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: I would have just assumed everyone was free to go if the director peaces out
8/28/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: I think I was 16
8/28/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Because sophomore year I was concert master, and then senior year again
8/28/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: But we were on good terms all senior year
8/28/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: And yeah
8/28/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: It helps that I felt really bad from the rehearsal before that were I yelled back at her
8/28/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: And also, no one benefits from a shitty concert
8/28/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: So it was kinda also in my own best interest
8/28/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Okay all good point all good points
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I HATED band practice
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Was absolutely awful
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: What did you play in it?
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Like director told me I didn‚Äôt have to play in concerts, I could just fake it
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Flute
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Which was fun
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Sometimes
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: OH THAT'S AWESOME
8/28/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: I love flute
8/28/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs one of the most interesting instruments anatomically I think
8/28/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs fun to play when you want to play
8/28/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Ah yep, that's the curse of practice
8/28/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: But I just wasn‚Äôt that great and didn‚Äôt practice a lot in my free time
8/28/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Literally only joined band so I could go with my friends on the Hershey Park band trip
8/28/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
8/28/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: The Hersheypark band trip
8/28/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: _classic_
8/28/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Okay well somehow I‚Äôm tired again so I should sleep soon
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: I used to like composing my own music a lot actually
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: So goodnight!  Sleep tight!  And don‚Äôt let Reid or Bradley bite!
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Bradley or Brantley
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Bradley
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: And thank you
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: *_BRADLY_*
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: oh I still spelled it wrong
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs sleep time
8/28/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Aha, okay, goodnight!
8/28/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: 'til tomorrow
8/29/19, 8:02 AM - Marianna: Good morning!
8/29/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Ah I forgot that I left the kitchen a mess
8/29/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not the most pleasant thing to wake up to
8/29/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Because now I know I‚Äôm gonna have to clean it later
8/29/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: OH MY GOSH
8/29/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: I ADDED BROOKE WHITCOMB ON SNAPCHAT LAST NIGHT AND SHE SENT ME A VIDEO OF DRUNK JOEY DANCING WITH SOME GIRL I DONT LIKE THIS
8/29/19, 9:00 AM - Caleb: Good moooorning
8/29/19, 9:01 AM - Caleb: I'm very sore, but the good kind
8/29/19, 9:01 AM - Caleb: :( to the dishes
8/29/19, 9:01 AM - Caleb: And JOEY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
8/29/19, 9:01 AM - Caleb: JOOOEEEYYY
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: You gotta warn him
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Wait what am I warning him about?
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: Idk, the girl?
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: Wait
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: Why don't you like her?
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: I feel like that's an important question
8/29/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Oh well I don‚Äôt like Brooke
8/29/19, 9:03 AM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs not the one he was dancing with
8/29/19, 9:03 AM - Marianna: I just don‚Äôt super like getting sent videos of him dancing with gals
8/29/19, 9:03 AM - Marianna: Idk who the girl was
8/29/19, 9:03 AM - Marianna: I suppose I could ask him but I‚Äôd also rather not you know
8/29/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Ohhh I thought Joey was dancing with a girl you don't like
8/29/19, 9:04 AM - Marianna: But I do like being sent things so I can keep eyes on him
8/29/19, 9:04 AM - Marianna: No I don‚Äôt know her
8/29/19, 9:04 AM - Marianna: I assume she‚Äôs a freshman
8/29/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Ahaaa
8/29/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Yeah that's less concerning
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Still weird that Brooke sent it to you
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: I almost don‚Äôt want him to become friends with Brooke
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: Idk
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever liked me
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: But I can‚Äôt tell him that
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs got to make his own friends
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: And hope he doesn‚Äôt sleep with her
8/29/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
8/29/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: Yeah, I feel like having a hands off approach to Joey this semester is a good call
8/29/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: As long as he's safe
8/29/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: Eh I haven‚Äôt heard that he‚Äôs done anything worth calling the cavalry in for yet
8/29/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: But I do like the Joey sighting snaps I‚Äôve gotten so far
8/29/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: Go Joey
8/29/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: Last nights less so but whatever
8/29/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: Have a fun semester
8/29/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Rootin for ya dude
8/29/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Yeah but also, it really is tainted because of who it's from
8/29/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Like, say if you got that snapchat from one of your friends that was at Davidson right now
8/29/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: I'd be waaaaaay more pleasant to see in the morning
8/29/19, 9:08 AM - Marianna: Yeah I just want him to be a freshmen
8/29/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: Nope I don‚Äôt actually think so
8/29/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd like to not dislike Brooke which is why I added her so maybe she‚Äôs doing it in a friendly way?
8/29/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: So!  You have your two science classes today?
8/29/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: Why do you think she sent it?
8/29/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs an easy one
8/29/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: _ALCOHOL_
8/29/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: ah of course
8/29/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: aLcOhOl
8/29/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: And kinda! I have med ethics (debatably science) and complexity of cancer
8/29/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: My ANNs + DL course is tomorrow! It's the first actual class we've had
8/29/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: So I'm excited
8/29/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: But not to be up earlier
8/29/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: Okay but they‚Äôre more sciencey
8/29/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: And ANNS + DL?
8/29/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning
8/29/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: Which makes my thumbs tired to type out
8/29/19, 9:17 AM - Marianna: Oh right how could I not know that acronym
8/29/19, 9:18 AM - Marianna: The accronym is also hard to type out
8/29/19, 9:18 AM - Marianna: This is a losing battle Caleb
8/29/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: Ah
8/29/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: Can't seem to catch a break
8/29/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/29/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: What do you have today? Anything fun?
8/29/19, 9:27 AM - Marianna: All day tour!
8/29/19, 9:27 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre going over to buda again to see ‚Äúbuda hill‚Äù
8/29/19, 9:27 AM - Marianna: So more sightseeing
8/29/19, 9:27 AM - Marianna: And I feel better so it shouldn‚Äôt be too bad
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Marianna: Still way warmer than I‚Äôd like
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: WOAH lucky you
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Sounds like lots of fun
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Just don't die of heat stroke
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm excited
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: I've heard that's not fun
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôll try
8/29/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Cool cool
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad they have these things to make us explore
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: Yeah, that's an awesome opportunity
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Marianna: Because it sounds like we‚Äôll see more today than most people do
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: AND it's for class
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: What more could you want?
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Marianna: Well not really
8/29/19, 9:29 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just the language class organizing it for us
8/29/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: Yeah but hey it's still something the allot time for you to do
8/29/19, 9:33 AM - Caleb: Anything you're particularly looking forward to with exploring?
8/29/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Today?  Or just in general?
8/29/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm glad they do
8/29/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: I feel a little obnoxious though because I bring andi with me
8/29/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: But whatever
8/29/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Just in general, or today if you've got something. Anywhere you've wanted to go for a while in Budapest?
8/29/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: And naaaaahhhh you're fine, I'm sure no one will get annoyed at Andi, he's a nice guy and very polite
8/29/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: I think we will see some cool things today
8/29/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: But I really want to get to the baths
8/29/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm waiting for sarah for that
8/29/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: And there are a few large parks I also want to go to
8/29/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: And there are some smaller towns that are kind of suburbs that are accessible by metro or train I think
8/29/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: What ar you excited about seeing in Copenhagen??
8/29/19, 10:37 AM - Caleb: Well
8/29/19, 10:37 AM - Caleb: There's a bunch of really beautiful gardens I want to get to
8/29/19, 10:37 AM - Caleb: As well as the royal library
8/29/19, 10:37 AM - Caleb: And also, traveling out to some more quiet neighborhoods
8/29/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: OH my Copenhagen History professor gave me a bunch of restaurants and bars and things to do
8/29/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: And apparently one of the places I NEED to go is the meat packing district
8/29/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: So that's up there
8/29/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Ooooh can you take me to the gardens when I visit
8/29/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: If you‚Äôll have me
8/29/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: Oh my goodness
8/29/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: We can TOTALLY go to the King's gardens, and I'd be delighted to have you
8/29/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: There's also a castle in the gardens, which is pretty cool
8/29/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs nice about the professor
8/29/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs hard to move to a new city and have to figure out what to do
8/29/19, 11:24 AM - Marianna: I still have the rick Steves Hungary I should read
8/29/19, 11:25 AM - Marianna: All of that sounds so good though!
8/29/19, 11:25 AM - Marianna: Now we just need a date
8/29/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: Yes! Would it work for you to call this weekend for us to pinpoint travel dates and whatnot? That way we can grab tickets before anything is too expensive
8/29/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: Also, there's an indoor botanical garden we can go to if the weather is bad
8/29/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: And I've heard it's INCREDIBLE
8/29/19, 11:28 AM - Marianna: Sure!  I may be on a trip this weekend with the program but I‚Äôll keep ya updated
8/29/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: Yeah no worries
8/29/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: And woah! That's exciting, where are you guys going?
8/29/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Lake balaton
8/29/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Its a lake
8/29/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs about all I know
8/29/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: But idk if it will happen or if I will go yet
8/29/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs mostly bsm kids going but that might be fun to meet them too
8/29/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Ooooo
8/29/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: That sound like fun
8/29/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: I feel like a big issue for me is that everyone gets abroad, wants to travel, makes a billion tentative plans, and then when then never work out logistics and everything falls through
8/29/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: It's so frustrating, and makes me just miss having a car
8/29/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Thank you Google photos for hitting me with these reminders
8/29/19, 2:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah no
8/29/19, 2:38 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I were planning
8/29/19, 2:38 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs like there are really not that many weekends
8/29/19, 2:38 PM - Marianna: And things aren‚Äôt really so close together
8/29/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: Especially in Budapest
8/29/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôve had an AMAZING day
8/29/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: But my phone is dying
8/29/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: So that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt been so responsive so I‚Äôll tell you about it when I get back
8/29/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: But also whoop whoop go matt Singleton
8/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Aha no worries, I've been in class anyway
8/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you've had an amazing day! I can't wait to hear more about it
8/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: And yeeeeeeep, good ol Matt
8/29/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Emily Juel and I had a really entertaining conversation about him
8/29/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: She's got TONS of stories
8/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I know emily hurl
8/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Juel **
8/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Back home!  At least for 20 minutes and then I‚Äôm going to yoga!
8/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: But today:
8/29/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: We rode a tram to the outskirts of buda and then took the children‚Äôs railway around the buda hill. It‚Äôs staffed by children as ticket collectors and in the stations and it was quite adorable
8/29/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: But the views were FANTASTIC
8/29/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: and it was just nice and peaceful to be riding in an open train car through the trees
8/29/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: And then we hiked to the top of the hill and went onto this lookout tower
8/29/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: I have photos I‚Äôll send you when I get back
8/29/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: BUT basically I was just struck in awe when I looked out at how much I could see
8/29/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: And then we walked down and took a chair lift DOWN the mountain which was oddly peaceful and we could just see Budapest in the distance below up
8/29/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: And then we ate goulash which is the traditional Hungarian soup at this tiny restaurant where the lady cooks by herself and mostly caters to the campers at the campsite nearby
8/29/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: And then we went home
8/29/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Freedom!
8/29/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Out of class for the day
8/29/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: And I have most of my homework done
8/29/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: THAT'S SO CUTE
8/29/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: They better have had tiny conductor hats
8/29/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: I can't wait for the pictures :)
8/29/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Oh my goodness I have missed yoga I feel so good
8/29/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: Woah how‚Äôd you manage getting out of class and already having most of your work done
8/29/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: Also that‚Äôs a late time to get out of class
8/29/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: And yeah let me just eat and clean the kitchen and maybe shower first and then I‚Äôll get photos off my camera!
8/29/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah I usually get out late on Mondays and Thursdays
8/29/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Tuesdays and Fridays I'm out at like 3
8/29/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm not quite ready to have like a set schedule like that
8/29/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Like I am because I like having a patterns and routine everyday
8/29/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôd hate being in class after 4
8/29/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: At Davidson, I‚Äôve only ever managed to take one afternoon lab and one afternoon seminar
8/29/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Usually I ended at 2:30 at the latest
8/29/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/29/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Oh you lucky soul
8/29/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Last semester I had a Friday afternoon orgo lab
8/29/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: #notfun
8/29/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: There was one semester where I also had a lab that directly went into orchestra
8/29/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: So I was in class from like 12 to 6:30 and I'd always be STARVING
8/29/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Also, update, I'm now sitting outside, looking at some pretty buildings I never noticed, and reading
8/29/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: And it's like 68 out
8/29/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: AND I've got my favorite sweater on
8/29/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: You are living LIFE my man
8/29/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm jamming to music with all my windows thrown open
8/29/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs to hoping bugs don‚Äôt come in!
8/29/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: I had a day like that but it was tai chi (with Sam owusu) after physics lab
8/29/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: Oh that's right! I forgot you know Sam
8/29/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: And also I'm currently debating putting on warm socks
8/29/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: It might be overkill, but overkill is my middle name
8/29/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: How does one get warm socks?
8/29/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Do you microwave them?
8/29/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Hi no beard Caleb
8/29/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Why hello there
8/29/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
8/29/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: But you see how the warm socks don‚Äôt make sense
8/29/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Forgiven
8/29/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: ... But also you totally know what I meant
8/29/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Yes but I don‚Äôt call them warm
8/29/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I call them fuzzy
8/29/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: But I guess yeah they are warm
8/29/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: And I decided not to go on the lake trip this weekend
8/29/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt really like lake swimming and the guide made it sound like that‚Äôs a lot of what you do there
8/29/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Ah, yeah I guess if you're not a fan of swimming that takes a lot of the joy out of it
8/29/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: I think it would still be fun to go and hang, by only if they don't try to make you swim
8/29/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: And I guess it's too early to know that
8/29/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah but have you ever been with friends at a body of water and said you don‚Äôt want to swim?
8/29/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Doesn‚Äôt end well
8/29/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Also not many AIT kids are going
8/29/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Plus o should get ready for sarah to get here
8/29/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: And by that I mean get SWASTED and be dumb with new friends
8/29/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: _KIDDING_
8/29/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Oh, ohhhhhh yeah I've been there
8/29/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Not fun, but also I enjoy swimming and cave to peer pressure
8/29/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: And WOAH! 5 DAYS MARIANNA
8/29/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: SHE'S COMING!
8/29/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Also dont forget
8/29/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: #2lit2quit
8/29/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: I KNOW ITS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAZY
8/29/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Joey told me today he tried to tally his drinks last night (yes a Wednesday) and he doesn‚Äôt know if it was 8 or 11
8/29/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm slightly worried about it
8/29/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: But also I think it‚Äôs what everyone does freshman year
8/29/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Oh Joey
8/29/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: There was an attempt, so yay?
8/29/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Most people mellow out eventually
8/29/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: I'm sure he'll be fine
8/29/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: As long as he has good friends to keep an eye out for him
8/29/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk
8/29/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: I hope
8/29/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: How has your day been!
8/29/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Well
8/29/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Pretty good!
8/29/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Im still reading
8/29/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: And put on a soundtrack
8/29/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: And hooooollllyyyyyyshiiiiit it's giving me shivers
8/29/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: What soundtrack?
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: And are you sure you‚Äôre doing the right reading
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/album/1hufHkRXl1TvVwPlfI1XLb?si=f8_mm20yTE20iaJlgI2irg
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: üôÉ
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: And YES I most definitely am
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: And if I'm not, I really won't mind
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Also, it's not actually a soundtrack
8/29/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: I'm just using it as one
8/29/19, 8:45 PM - Caleb: And then after I'm done, I'm reading my flatmates essay because she wants a native English speaker to help with wording
8/29/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: Yay good for you
8/29/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs it about/what class?
8/29/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: And oh that‚Äôs so sweet!
8/29/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: Yeah I imagine if you‚Äôre living with Americans all of a sudden, they might be good resources for things like that
8/29/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: I had a friend who was fluent in Spanish though in high school and she was like no don‚Äôt ask me for help I can‚Äôt do grammar for shit I just know how to speak it, not any of the rules
8/29/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: It's Nordic Mythology!
8/29/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: They're incredible stories
8/29/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Very very vivid
8/29/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: The music definitely adds a lot
8/29/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: And yeaaah, I'm the same way. As long as I can write it as it "sounds" right, I'll be fine, but if I need to explain any of why I'm doing it, then oh well
8/29/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: I'm sure I won't though
8/29/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Also, I remember back in high school, I had some Chinese friends
8/29/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: They didn't help me with homework, they just taught me insults/swearing in Chinese
8/29/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Which I guess might be useful in its own rite
8/29/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah those NEED epic background soundtracks when you read them
8/29/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm hoping our teacher teaches us some curse words
8/29/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: She mentioned it
8/29/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: In like a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to teach you them so you can use them but so you know if someone calls you them‚Äù
8/29/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: Also!  Photos!
8/29/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>

8/29/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: Oh my word
8/29/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: That's such a fun day
8/29/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: Also that kid is older than I thought
8/29/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: I was imagining like a 4 year old
8/29/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: ... Which is a lot less practical
8/29/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: The view is breathtaking! I love the woods
8/29/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: And also, quality mirror-ish selfie
8/29/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: Creative ones are always the best
8/29/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Also, Reid is now going to go hang out with Marion and do Jager bombs
8/29/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: On a Thursday night
8/29/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: They both have class tomorrow
8/29/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah they‚Äôre all kids from 11-14
8/29/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: You know me I love me some mirror selfies
8/29/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: Thought it was a little artsy
8/29/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I love taking mirror selfies with andi
8/29/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so extra
8/29/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: And what!!! I want to do jager bombs with Marion !!!!
8/29/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: :(
8/29/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt wait till sarah gets here so we can make bad decisions on school nights :(
8/29/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: And hey man most people do Thursday nights in college
8/29/19, 9:16 PM - Marianna: Our campus is just weird
8/29/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Oh God you're making me want to go down and do it now
8/29/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: I'm almost done with reading
8/29/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: Am I falling to peer pressure
8/29/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: DO IT FOR ME
8/29/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: Indirect peer pressure
8/29/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: TELL MARION YOURE MY REPLACEMENT BECAUSE I WISH I COULD DO IT WITH HER
8/29/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: I mean only if you want to
8/29/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: üòà
8/29/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: But if I want to...
8/29/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: ... I have to?
8/29/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Yup
8/29/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Just ask marion
8/29/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: She's not down here yet
8/29/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: I should party with her AT SOME POINT
8/29/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs crazy
8/29/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: Love her
8/29/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: But I'm not going too hard on a Thursday when I have someone else's essay to proofread
8/29/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: But you have to brace yourself for going out with marion
8/29/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs a smart decision and good point
8/29/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Yeah if it was my own I'd be like SCREW IT
8/29/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: But it's for someone else
8/29/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: And I'd prefer to do that well
8/29/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: GOOD boy
8/29/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Sorry I think my brain was gonna say something else
8/29/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt know what it is
8/29/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Poor brain
8/29/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: But hey at least I‚Äôve gotten ridden of my Brian problem
8/29/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: No Brian problem?
8/29/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: I don't know if I was filled in on that
8/29/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: Also
8/29/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Brain
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Biran
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Brian
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Molly
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: ü§¢
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Also?
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Caleb: OH BRIAN
8/29/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: MARION
8/29/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Can you please tell her I love her and want some jager
8/29/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Check your snapchat
8/29/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: Oh so lovely
8/29/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: Class act every day of the week
8/29/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm eating ice cream in the farm
8/29/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: Dark**
8/29/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: You're having a good night too then!
8/29/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: And I'm guessing there's gossip girl?
8/29/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm now back and proofreading a 24 page essay on narcissism
8/29/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Yes but I‚Äôve turned it off now
8/29/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Now it‚Äôs just music and lying in bed till my eyes decide to quit
8/29/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: And whoo!  All those kids downstairs ain‚Äôt got nothing on your Thursday night plans
8/29/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: Awww, honestly sounds fun
8/29/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: If you fall asleep, goodnight!
8/29/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: If not, I'll be up for a while so shoot me whatever pops into your head :)
8/29/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Okay I love your discover weekly this week
8/29/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Such a good vibe
8/29/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Hey I'm glad to hear it! Now it's a two way street too
8/29/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: I totally can't take credit for it though
8/29/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre the inspiration though?
8/29/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Your digital persona generated it with the help of Spotify‚Äôs algorithm?
8/29/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I dislike that Spotify has switched from ‚Äúadded songs‚Äù to ‚Äúliked songs‚Äù because I don‚Äôt like everything I add and I like some things I don‚Äôt add, I just put them in playlists
8/29/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Hey if it means I'm inspiring something, I'll take it üòÅ
8/29/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Do you ever think about how many people are truly influenced by you? I feel like it's really hard to gage the role you play in other people's lives sometimes, and maybe it's a selfish thing to even wonder about
8/29/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: I think inspired and influenced by people are different
8/29/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: Like ive had a lot of creative friends who have flat out used me (not in a bad way) for all sorts of art so I‚Äôve been an inspiration that way
8/29/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: But sometimes an art inspiration isn‚Äôt as personal to who the actual people is
8/29/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: But an influence is
8/29/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Like if I influence you for better or worse, that‚Äôs because of who I am as a person not just how I can show you how to make art by doing something
8/29/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Idk if that makes sense
8/29/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Just 10:45 thoughts for you
8/29/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Well I enjoy your thoughts at any time
8/29/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: But I always enjoy a good deep conversation
8/29/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: Idk, things like that sometimes snap into my head and I get hyper cautious of how I act
8/29/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: Because sometimes I know I'm definitely not the best influence
8/29/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a bad influence
8/29/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been a bad influence either
8/29/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Well maybe
8/29/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: But I know some people who are ALWAYS bad influences
8/29/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Or even REGULARLY
8/29/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs either of us
8/29/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Okay I too love these convos with you why do we do them when one of us is trying to fall asleep?
8/29/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Because I gotta go and be up for class tomorrow morning. Goodnight!
8/29/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Sov godt!
8/29/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: And sorry about that, I think it's a combination of two factors
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: First, we're usually both free and in bed at night, so it's an easy back-and-forth and very productive
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: And two, idk about you, but tired me is a LOT more ready to talk about real things
8/29/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: But hey, looks like we've got some fodder for good late night convos, so I can live with that :)
8/29/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Anyway, goodnight! Sleep well!
8/30/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: I just finished like 4 hours of revising this paper
8/30/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: My brain is mush
8/30/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: Goodnight
8/30/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: Happy Friday :)
8/30/19, 7:47 AM - Marianna: Oh you don‚Äôt have to be sorry about it I was just reflecting that thats been a pattern
8/30/19, 7:47 AM - Marianna: Happy Friday though!
8/30/19, 7:47 AM - Marianna: I cannot believe you were up until 2am
8/30/19, 7:47 AM - Marianna: You are a better friend than I am
8/30/19, 7:48 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure I would have made it for 4 hours
8/30/19, 8:28 AM - Marianna: UPDATE Brooke sent me another video of Joey grinding with this girl like the same girl
8/30/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: Yeah update brain still unhappy
8/30/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: And broooooooooooooooooooooke
8/30/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: C'mon now
8/30/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: I'd be so uncomfortable
8/30/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: Like, I have 0 interest in knowing that stuff
8/30/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: Or ever having it recorded and sent out
8/30/19, 8:49 AM - Caleb: But also like I've said before, when it comes to that stuff, I'm a much more private person
8/30/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry brain
8/30/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: But hey you‚Äôve got fun classes today!
8/30/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Can‚Äôt brain get excited about that?
8/30/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Yeah honestly I feel bad for him I‚Äôve got my own little Joey monitor who has no qualms about sending me this stuff
8/30/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: But like seeing it is a little off putting
8/30/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: But also I guess I‚Äôll see it when we go out in the spring
8/30/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: Also then you should watch out for drunk marianna. Depending on her mood, she sometimes REALLY likes pda
8/30/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Jokes on you! ALL my classes are fun!
8/30/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: But yeah this is a lot less pressure today
8/30/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: Especially because for the Copenhagen class, I'm going to a castle!
8/30/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: Oh and re: the pda thing
8/30/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: That's totally fine
8/30/19, 9:10 AM - Caleb: If I'm drunk I'm sure I'll TOTALLY be into it
8/30/19, 9:10 AM - Caleb: I just wouldn't like it recorded and sent to my family or anything
8/30/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: I tend to like to be in control of what information about me is spread, but in like a not-controlling way if that makes sense
8/30/19, 9:26 AM - Caleb: Anyway, how's your day looking?
8/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Oh castle!! Send pictures!
8/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Are you taking veev?
8/30/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Yeah audrey has had an issue because all of her teammates really enjoy taking videos of her doing dance floor makeouts and man she does a lot of dance floor makeouts so she routinely wakes up to the swim group chat FULL of her and her conquest(s) from the night before
8/30/19, 10:42 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôve had one class already and I have one more and this afternoon we have a project of going to the market and using Hungarian and making a sandwich as a team but I don‚Äôt feel good again so I‚Äôm just doing the class and not going to the market
8/30/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: I forgot veev :(
8/30/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: It turns out that it's like a five minute walk from class though, so you bet I'll be back
8/30/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: Here are some quick shots from my phone though
8/30/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: Oh still pretty cool
8/30/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so nice and convenient to just be able to take a class period and go somewhere outside the classes?  A
8/30/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: Are they longer classes than davidson?  Because I could never see a davidson professor being like HEY let‚Äôs go for a walk to explore this cool place 5 minutes away
8/30/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: But maybe we just don‚Äôt have too many cool places 5 minutes away
8/30/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Oh totally
8/30/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: I wish we had more time though
8/30/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: The class periods are a little more than an hour, I think like 1:20?
8/30/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: And aha we're just taking the wrong classes then
8/30/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Well, I guess it's only like ecology that does that
8/30/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: They take pretty frequent trips to the cross country trails
8/30/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Does Budapest have anything cool near your campus?
8/30/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Oh but I do hate long classes
8/30/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: And yeah
8/30/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll drop math and pick up environmental studies or whatever
8/30/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: You know what I want
8/30/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: LAKE CAMPUS CLASS TRIPS
8/30/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: that would be absolutely the best
8/30/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: LAKE CAMPUS!
8/30/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Aw man now I miss Davidson
8/30/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: I miss lake campus
8/30/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: I didn't use it enough
8/30/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: But now I'll have a car, so something tells me I'll be going on frequent trips out there
8/30/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: You know what I miss
8/30/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: M&Ms
8/30/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: ... They don't have M&Ms in Budapest?
8/30/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: But yeah you think that but whenever it‚Äôs nice enough to GO to lake campus, it‚Äôs too busy with finals and stuff
8/30/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Or at least that‚Äôs been my experience
8/30/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: And not that I‚Äôve found!
8/30/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm telling you the food here is the shock
8/30/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: :(
8/30/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Yeah you're right
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: Life at Davidson just gets too busy
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: But AFTER FINALS
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: so much lake time
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: After finals?
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Yeah like before you have to leave
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: Ahaaaaa that's right
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: I forgot
8/30/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: I can't bounce right away
8/30/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: Yay! That'll be fun
8/30/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: And especially with your rlo duties, you have to stay for so long
8/30/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: It just kinda sucks because all my friends leave before then
8/30/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: So it just me and my hall counselor pals
8/30/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Hey maybe I‚Äôll stay next year
8/30/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: I mean I stayed almost entirely until graduation this year
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôll actually have friends graduating next year
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: I mean not that I didn‚Äôt last year
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt actually go to graduation
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: :)
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: :(
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: :(
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: Not yet
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: No sad
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt think about that yes
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: NO SAD
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: Yet**
8/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: No sad!
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs my line!
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Right right right
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm watching stranger things and it‚Äôs NASTY
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Too early to be stressed about after college
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: That's what med school is for
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Stress
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Yee
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: And oh? Which season are you watching?
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: dude we have so many more years of undergrad
8/30/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: No worries yet
8/30/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: 3
8/30/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: ... 2
8/30/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: OKAY MOVING ON
8/30/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: You don't like horror films, right?
8/30/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: You get pretty easily spooked by them?
8/30/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: No no
8/30/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Me no like
8/30/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Well I like them if I am with a group of people at like a sleepover
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: But I can‚Äôt watch them alone or be alone after
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: I also have a tube of strawberry cheesecake Hungarian Oreos
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Soo
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Well I _think_ I could help with that
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not alone!
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: And OOOOOOOH THOSE SOUND GOOD
8/30/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: No you‚Äôll see me at my worst
8/30/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Your worst is after a scary movie?
8/30/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: No?
8/30/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not very fun though
8/30/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Just v scared
8/30/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Sounds fun! Have you ever done a haunted house?
8/30/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Yes!  I like those!
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre adventures!
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Did you have field of screams in Pennsylvania?
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: WE SHOULD DO SCAROWINDS
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: ... Next October
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: And no! I actually haven't
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: It's right in my neck of the woods too
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: I'm shameful
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Have you?
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah it‚Äôs gonna be weird not having halloweenend
8/30/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Yeah!
8/30/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: 8th grade I think
8/30/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Maybe 9th as well
8/30/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Have I told you about the scar on my hip?  It‚Äôs not as noticeable as it was so you might not have seen it
8/30/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: No I don't think you have actually
8/30/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: From field of screams?
8/30/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: From afterwards
8/30/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: So only tangentially related
8/30/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: But we did field of screams and then went to my friends house in the woods and ran around
8/30/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: And I ‚Äúfell‚Äù
8/30/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: Aka in my opinion was tripped
8/30/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: And skidded on my side and smashed my phone
8/30/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And this was in 9th grade?
8/30/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: That's absolutely wild
8/30/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: I feel like we get all sorts of dumb scars as kids
8/30/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Have I ever told you about how I shattered my front tooth in 2nd grade?
8/30/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And that it's still half fake?
8/30/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: 8th I think
8/30/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: And what?! I don‚Äôt think I knew this??  What‚Äôs the story?
8/30/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm in class
8/30/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: We got a quick break
8/30/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: Basically, tag in second grade gym, someone pushed me over, I fell and hit the floor with me teeth and my front right one shattered
8/30/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: So now I have a fake tooth! Not my most exciting story definitely
8/30/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: I just napped for 2 hours again
8/30/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Ah
8/30/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: That's on-brand
8/30/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: :)
8/30/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: And now instead of getting out of bed, I‚Äôm gonna turn on Netflix and eat tortilla chips
8/30/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: #livingthelife
8/30/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: But pretty lunch(?) !!!
8/30/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Dinner? It's like 4:30?
8/30/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: wait is that actually dinner
8/30/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: ... Yes?
8/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: Woah you eat so early!
8/30/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: No no no
8/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been eating dinner at like 7pm or so
8/30/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: I eat so _inconsistently_
8/30/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: A lot worse
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: Well I do just snack all day
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: You know me
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm eating _constantly_
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: I barely eat
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: It's sort of an issue sometimes
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: Food is good!
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: Food are friends!
8/30/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: Then WHY AM I EATING THEM
8/30/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: Because
8/30/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: Food are meant to be eaten
8/30/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: It is their destiny
8/30/19, 4:34 PM - Marianna: And they‚Äôre helping us fulfill our destiny
8/30/19, 4:35 PM - Marianna: So they are friends
8/30/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Ahhh
8/30/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: I just remembered I need to go out and get groceries
8/30/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure what I want to make though
8/30/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know either man
8/30/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: I do love me some grocery shopping though
8/30/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: Is the shop far from campus?
8/30/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: Well
8/30/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: I'm back at the flat
8/30/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: (which we're thinking of naming, but we don't know what)
8/30/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: And then theres a grocery store called F√∏tex
8/30/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: And they're somewhere between a target and a giant
8/30/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: So they've got a bunch of random homegoods and clothes and stuff like that, but also they have good groceries
8/30/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: I want to go out tonight but that‚Äôs not a good idea
8/30/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: And ooooooh that sounds fun
8/30/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: Very very down for a target/giant run anytime
8/30/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: I honestly thing I go to target and the grocery store for fun
8/30/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: Idk why that seems like a weird thing to do
8/30/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Haha sounds like it should go on the list?
8/30/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: I mean I do go very often during the school year
8/30/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôd love to have you along for one of them
8/30/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: WELL
8/30/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: Date idea: go to the grocery store together, buy food, go to new dorm, and bake
8/30/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Also shopping is only fun if the person I'm with is okay with me being goofy
8/30/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Not like derailing everything, but just having fun with it
8/30/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Like my poor mother who has to put up with me not being able to find anything
8/30/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Oh man she gets so frustrated sometimes
8/30/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: I swear I'm shelf-blind though
8/30/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Oh there is a level I tolerate
8/30/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Like if I‚Äôm in a rush, I just want to go in and get out
8/30/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: But sometimes I like the goofy I guess
8/30/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had people be good goofy in the store
8/30/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Oh no don't worry I'm totally good goofy
8/30/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Chaotic good or something
8/30/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Your poor mom though
8/30/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Ha!  Are you chaotic good in general?
8/30/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: Idk
8/30/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: I'll let you decide that
8/30/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: Also, Norwegian Hana is making Norwegian Pancakes for us!
8/30/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: Okay I never know what people are
8/30/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know what I am
8/30/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: And yay!!!
8/30/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Id say I'm chaotic good
8/30/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Id call you lawful good
8/30/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: Drunk Marianna is chaotic good, maybe neutral sometimes
8/30/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: Also, the Danish supermarket on a Friday afternoon is hilarious
8/30/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: It's all sorts of people flocking to the booze isle
8/30/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Sounds about right
8/30/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: In all accounts
8/30/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Ohhhhhh yeah
8/30/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: I think there are like actual liquor stores here
8/30/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: Like in the us
8/30/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt been to one yet
8/30/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: Oh? You going to one?
8/30/19, 6:00 PM - Marianna: But I need some captain
8/30/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: CAPTAIN MARIANNA

8/30/19, 6:02 PM - Marianna: Maybe not tonight
8/30/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: I may go to a bar with friends and just chill
8/30/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: But no clubbing
8/30/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: No clubbing? You worn out?
8/30/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I just think the noise wouldn‚Äôt be good
8/30/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I mean get some alc in me and I‚Äôd probably be fine
8/30/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs probably not a _GOOD_ decision
8/30/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: And what semester is it?
8/30/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
8/30/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: It's _not_ freshman fall
8/30/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: So we both should probably keep that in mind
8/30/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Hey I was a model student freshman fall
8/30/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: And you know why?
8/30/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I know you did
8/30/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: But then you had it delayed
8/30/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Why?

8/30/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: A little pinched but good
8/30/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: it shouldn‚Äôt be my middle name
8/30/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think many of my spontaneous decisions have turned out right
8/30/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Not awful for the most part though
8/30/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: JOIN ME

8/30/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Meaning we are so far away
8/30/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt think I can make it to Copenhagen tonight
8/30/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Because spontanaity is hard from 800 miles

8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Okay next semester
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Don't remind me
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Well!
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Asking you to go stargazing the first time was definitely a spontaneous decisions
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: I was eating pancakes on the fiji porch
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: And was like Sarah am I insane
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: And it worked out Id say
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: I just invited a boy I don‚Äôt really know to go stargazing
8/30/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: What would have happened if you didn't?
8/30/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know
8/30/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: I probably would have seen you after hat
8/30/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: But it was fun
8/30/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Remember always lie downhill
8/30/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Aha I was thinking about that today
8/30/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure why
8/30/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: OH I REMEMBER
8/30/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: What
8/30/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a crazy coincidence
8/30/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: It was last night
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Last night?
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: No it was crossfit actually
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: I laid in the grass
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: And kinda just muttered to myself "lay downhill?" and Reid was like "what"
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: :)
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Teach Reid
8/30/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Stargaze with Reid
8/30/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Maybe don‚Äôt cuddle as much as we did
8/30/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: *as much*
8/30/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Okay Marianna
8/30/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: I'll try
8/30/19, 8:04 PM - Marianna: Okay cuddle with your roommate if you like
8/30/19, 8:04 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure I will this semester
8/30/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: Sarah‚Äôs already requested we have sleepovers sometimes
8/30/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Wait what
8/30/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Really?
8/30/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: Yes?
8/30/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: We have separate rooms but she says we have to sleepover in the same room sometimes
8/30/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: That'll be so much fun!
8/30/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: I'm really happy you guys are living together
8/30/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: Me too
8/30/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm hoping it will work for us
8/30/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: But we do have very dissimilar sleeping habits
8/30/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: But we‚Äôll see how that goes
8/30/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: Well it definitely helps that you have _options_ of sleepovers
8/30/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: Having a mandatory roommate isn't the best situation to be in
8/30/19, 8:09 PM - Marianna: Idk I kind of like having a roommate
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Ah
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a mandatory friend
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: Or at least someone to talk to
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: I just like not having to dance around someone else's schedule
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: Idk
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: It's a mixed bag tbh
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: In my head that‚Äôs a small price to pay
8/30/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: But if they SNORE, that‚Äôs a whole nother ballgame
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: @audrey
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: Or if they bring in a third roommate
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: @drake
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: I liked him!
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: I'm really curious how RLO is going to pan out for my rooming situation
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt like him being naked all the time
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: But again, that was his problem
8/30/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: And THAT'S the issue here
8/30/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd hate you having a single
8/30/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I think I'd enjoy having a roommate for a good bit
8/30/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: As long as that roommate is unofficially you ;)
8/30/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: But worse comes to worse, I‚Äôve had a pretty good track record at making friends with roommates and low key pulling a drake and you‚Äôre good at people so if they stick me with a rando, im sure you can make friends
8/30/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: Hey thanks for having me
8/30/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: If you‚Äôll have me
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm a little too tipsy for 8pm
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: I thought most little hall counselors were normally in singles though?
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: My bad if the flirting is too direct
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: Me too honestly
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: W O ah
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: Tipsy Marianna
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve broken out the scotch a little bit
8/30/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: _I'd never_

8/30/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: No I‚Äôd never
8/30/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a class act
8/30/19, 8:15 PM - Caleb: Hey I think you're incredibly attractive and I think about you a surprising amount
8/30/19, 8:16 PM - Caleb: Both insanely attractive in personality and physically
8/30/19, 8:16 PM - Caleb: How's that for not _too_ direct?
8/30/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: Okay well that‚Äôs a little more direct
8/30/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: But not awful
8/30/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: So thank you?
8/30/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Anytiiiime
8/30/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not quite at your level yet though
8/30/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: You seem to be a good level

8/30/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Well thank you
8/30/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: But at the moment I'm folding laundry
8/30/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Not my ideal nigh
8/30/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Night*

8/30/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: Are you going to end up going out with friends?
8/30/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/30/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Hans suggested the bar he‚Äôs wanted to go to for a while
8/30/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: So no club
8/30/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Just drinks and talking probably
8/30/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Which is going to kind of be fun
8/30/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: But im not entirely sure what to talk about with these people
8/30/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Like I haven‚Äôt had a lot of like OH I WANT TO GET TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
8/30/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: So we‚Äôll see if it turns awkward I‚Äôm just hoping not
8/30/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: It won't
8/30/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: It'll be fun
8/30/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: And you know it
8/30/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: I hope
8/30/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: Oh christ now we're doing shots

8/30/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: How are you feeling about not going to the lake thing?
8/30/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: Good
8/30/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm really not sure I‚Äôd like it
8/30/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: And considering I don‚Äôt feel amazing with my allergies, staying inside might be better
8/30/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Okay, I think you're making the right call
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Update now I have a gin and tonic again
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: This night is a slippery slope
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Pls check up on me
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Slip slip
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Sip sip
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Motherfucker
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Okay please be safe
8/30/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: I will
8/30/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: As much as I can for however far away I am
8/30/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: And I'm not _just_ saying that because I want to talk to you tonight a lot
8/30/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: Okay
8/30/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: Well let me know when you get in
8/30/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll probably be in before you
8/30/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Oh holy shit
8/30/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: A quote from the room I'm in
8/30/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: "Eva how much have you had to drink"
8/30/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: "yes"
8/30/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Tell Eva I love her that‚Äôs such a mood
8/30/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: She says "well, I maybe need some more interaction to feel the love, but I accept the feelins and embrace them even though I'm not ready to reciprocate *Shakira noises*"
8/30/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: What
8/30/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: That makes no sense to me
8/30/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm not drunk
8/30/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: She says she accepts your love even though she maybe isnt ready to reciprocate üòçüòç
8/30/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/30/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Well she can do that
8/30/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: I accept my love unreciprocated
8/30/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: I hope she has a good night still
8/30/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: That was Eva
8/30/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: For the record
8/30/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah I figured
8/30/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: She sounds like she is having a wild one
8/30/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: We're all having a wild one
8/30/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: This a fun night
8/30/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: WILD ONES FOR THE WIN
8/30/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Marianna

8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Very very good
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôd you know I was gonna ask that
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Because
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: I do
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: What
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: And that's that
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: I'm very drunk
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre not omniscient!
8/30/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Did you know I like you
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Like a lot
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs basically the same thing
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: You made me smile
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Voool I just wanted to make sure
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: You're absolutely wonderful
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Which turned into a coughing fit
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: And I like you more than I think I've liked anyone evert
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: No no not me
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Oh stawp
8/30/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: You are too sweet
8/30/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: I should put rum in you more often
8/30/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Why tho
8/30/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: I'd tell you this sober if I had the balls
8/30/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: Well i guess it‚Äôs nice to hear that as well as the sentiment haha
8/30/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: What time is the concert?
8/30/19, 9:37 PM - Caleb: 10
8/30/19, 9:37 PM - Caleb: Update

8/30/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: He is extremely intoxicated so I am in control of his phone but he is all good
8/31/19, 12:03 AM - Marianna: Okay good
8/31/19, 12:03 AM - Marianna: He can‚Äôt text for shit sober sooooo
8/31/19, 12:03 AM - Marianna: Probably better to revoke his texting privileges
8/31/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: Hahaha you're probably right
8/31/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: Marianna
8/31/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: Caleb
8/31/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: Or Hannah
8/31/19, 12:30 AM - Caleb: Please
8/31/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: Uh please what?
8/31/19, 12:54 AM - Marianna: Okay well I really really hope you‚Äôre okay but I‚Äôm gonna sleep now so goodnight?
8/31/19, 7:08 AM - Caleb: Ok wow not a good night for me
8/31/19, 7:10 AM - Caleb: I think it's about time to uhhh abandon all technology and live my life as a cloistered monk
8/31/19, 7:11 AM - Caleb: Also, having someone say they've roofied you, joking or not, is an absolutely terrifying experience
8/31/19, 7:11 AM - Caleb: And that's the last fucking time I drink with people I only know a good bit
8/31/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: Only know a little bit*
8/31/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: I'm so sorry if I had you worried
8/31/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: I had good people taking care of me after that
8/31/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: Update: I'm about to sail a viking ship
8/31/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: This'll be a fun morning
8/31/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: Good morning
8/31/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: I am glad you‚Äôre okay
8/31/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: What happened?  You didn‚Äôt make much sense last night
8/31/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: Also yeah that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt gone hard because I don‚Äôt know or really trust people around me with taking care of me yet
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Marianna: I only like drinking when I‚Äôm in comfortable places
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: Well
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: Oh geez
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Marianna: But do thank Hannah this morning she seemed to be making sure you were all right
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Marianna: And a Viking ship?!  Sounds fun!  But why?
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: Yeah, I already thanked her a lot
8/31/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: Don't worry
8/31/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: And good morning!
8/31/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: So, basically, here's the rundown
8/31/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: I was planning on just hanging out with friends
8/31/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: Mostly just in my apartment
8/31/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: And so we started with waffles and booze, which is a quality night in the making
8/31/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: And THEN they were like "we're all going to a concert! Come with us!" and I was like "sure!"
8/31/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: So I bought a ticket, and we hang out in the flat and we're just chilling for a good bit
8/31/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: Half of the group left for another pregame, but I stayed behind with like 3 other people and was just hanging out
8/31/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: And I was doing really well!
8/31/19, 9:20 AM - Caleb: And then we decide to head to the concert, but first swing by the other flat to pick up other people at the pregame
8/31/19, 9:20 AM - Caleb: So we swing by, and I see a guy I sorta know, and he goes "here! Have some of this!" and I'm like "sure!" and take a swig
8/31/19, 9:21 AM - Caleb: And as we're walking over, he goes "haha yeah I roofie own drinks so I get fucked up faster" and I go WHAT
8/31/19, 9:21 AM - Caleb: And then I went downhill incredibly quickly
8/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: And then the rest of the night is a hour
8/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: Blur*
8/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: I'm really really unsure of what actually happened
8/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: It might have just been the alcohol catching up to me and me panicking, or he might not have been joking, I'm really not sure
8/31/19, 9:23 AM - Caleb: I'd lean towards alcohol and panic, but I guess it might just be a more comforting idea than the alternative
8/31/19, 9:24 AM - Caleb: So anyway, needless to say, that's the last night out for me for a good while
8/31/19, 9:24 AM - Caleb: How was your night?
8/31/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: Woah that guy is awful
8/31/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs one thing to do it to your own
8/31/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: Which is still kind of screwed up
8/31/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: But then to give it to people and not tell them?!?!
8/31/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: I wish it was Davidson and you could 100% report that
8/31/19, 9:36 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs dangerous to everyone around him if they don‚Äôt know
8/31/19, 9:36 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm mad at this guy from all the way down here
8/31/19, 9:36 AM - Marianna: Like the fuck?
8/31/19, 9:36 AM - Marianna: Did you actually make it to the concert?  Do you remember any of it?
8/31/19, 9:37 AM - Marianna: And my night was pretty good
8/31/19, 9:37 AM - Marianna: We walked around for a bit and eventually found a bar that looked cool
8/31/19, 9:37 AM - Marianna: It had coffee shop vibes
8/31/19, 9:37 AM - Marianna: Mostly because it IS a coffee shop during the day and then kind of transitions to alcohol
8/31/19, 9:37 AM - Marianna: And I had my first gin and tonic
8/31/19, 9:38 AM - Marianna: And then we all went to bed shortly after midnight
8/31/19, 9:38 AM - Marianna: So a pretty chill night
8/31/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: Yeah
8/31/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: I already didn't like him
8/31/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: But he didn't score any points
8/31/19, 9:41 AM - Caleb: I also really don't think he actually did
8/31/19, 9:41 AM - Caleb: But still, telling me that he did sorta just sent me into a downward spiral
8/31/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: Drunk, phoneless, surrounded by a massive crowd that you don't know, and in a foreign country where no one is speaking English? Not a good set of conditions
8/31/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: And hey! That sounds like an awesome night
8/31/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: I'm glad you had fun
8/31/19, 9:44 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm not sure if doing it or not is important here. Like whether or not he did, what we know he did do is really mean
8/31/19, 9:45 AM - Marianna: Because either he pointlessly scared you
8/31/19, 9:45 AM - Marianna: Or he drugged you and only told you after
8/31/19, 9:45 AM - Marianna: Although I‚Äôve had friends who have been roofied and it takes a lot longer than a night to get it out of your system
8/31/19, 9:45 AM - Marianna: So if you‚Äôre feeling better now, that‚Äôs probably a good sign
8/31/19, 9:46 AM - Marianna: The people I know who have like couldn‚Äôt sleep for days and their Brian felt messed up and it was only after a few days of that that they started to think maybe they were drugged in some cases
8/31/19, 9:47 AM - Marianna: Oh no Brian is back
8/31/19, 9:47 AM - Marianna: But yeah, good night
8/31/19, 9:47 AM - Marianna: I really do enjoy the dance clubs more I think
8/31/19, 9:48 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs just my kind of going out
8/31/19, 10:01 AM - Caleb: Oh no I still feel like garbage
8/31/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: But like tolerable garbage
8/31/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Maybe just recycling
8/31/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: And Brian! Didn't you mention him the other night too?
8/31/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: ‚ÄúMaybe just recycling ‚Äú
8/31/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: I like that
8/31/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: And yeah but last time I mentioned him, I was remarking how I no longer had my Brian problem
8/31/19, 10:08 AM - Marianna: Wait how did you get up this morning and decide to go to a Viking ship?

8/31/19, 10:35 AM - Caleb: Hello from the seas
8/31/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: Also I totally signed up for this like a week ago
8/31/19, 10:47 AM - Marianna: Oooh fun
8/31/19, 10:47 AM - Marianna: That makes more sense
8/31/19, 10:48 AM - Marianna: Things start too early on saturdays
8/31/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: I made eggs!
8/31/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: And more of those paprika sausages
8/31/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: Update I still can‚Äôt tolerate the heat!
8/31/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: Why did I move to a country that likes spicy things so much
8/31/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: New goal in life: become a doctor, move to a small coastal town in Scandinavia, and spend my free time sailing around the European coast
8/31/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: Pretty lovely out here, gotta say
8/31/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: Oh wow that sounds and looks amazing
8/31/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: But do doctors really have time to just sail around the European coast
8/31/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Uh no but I'm allowed to dream
8/31/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: Then dream away
8/31/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm trying to think of a way to make this into an anchors away joke
8/31/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: But I can‚Äôt do it
8/31/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: Is the ship just sailing around?  Or is it like a tour?  Are learning or just cruising and having fun?
8/31/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: It's light sailing
8/31/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: We rowed out to the middle of the water, hoisted the sails, and now are just kind of going around the islands
8/31/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: Oh that sounds so lovely
8/31/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: I really enjoyed just floating on mcleans boat last semester with Sarah
8/31/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: While I hate being in water, weirdly enough, I love sitting and feeling it‚Äôs sway and all that
8/31/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Yeah, it's really relaxing
8/31/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Maybe waves didn't work too great today with my hangover, but usually it's pretty enjoyable
8/31/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Lee is probably getting a boat at Davidson when we're all back, so I'll probably hit the water a good bit when the weather is nice
8/31/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I wouldn‚Äôt think waves would be the best after a rough night
8/31/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: And woah that‚Äôs gonna be so fun!
8/31/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Why/how is he ‚Äúgetting a boat at Davidson‚Äù?
8/31/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Is this like a normal thing for people just to have boats at school?
8/31/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Ahaha no his family is from Charleston, so they're SUPER into sailing
8/31/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: It's a family tradition
8/31/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: So he was going to buy his dad's old Sunfish, which is like a 15 foot sailboat
8/31/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: They're tiny, but would still be really fun
8/31/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Also, you'd LOVE this town im in
8/31/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: It's so photogenic, rich in history, and quiet
8/31/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: There's fun markets, vines on brick, a sea breeze, and friendly people everywhere
8/31/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: Oh yes Charleston is very into boats
8/31/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: And ooooooh well I hope you have veev this time?
8/31/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: That sounds dreamy
8/31/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm stuck inside doing laundry
8/31/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: Oh I definitely had veev
8/31/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: I didn't take him onto the water because I feel like saltwater and cameras don't mix well, but I honestly wish I did
8/31/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm soooooo nervous with my camera around water
8/31/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: But ohhh it looks like such a nice day there
8/31/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: That's just a couple of them
8/31/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah the weather was absolutely perfect
8/31/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: It's like 76¬∞ and sunny all day
8/31/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Are you still exploring or back home?
8/31/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: The whole group is heading back to Copenhagen, and I didn't want to be stranded out there
8/31/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Yeah stranded is no good
8/31/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: Even though there are _definitely_ worse places to be left behind
8/31/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: I want more people to get here!
8/31/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: 3
8/31/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: DAYS
8/31/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Some people have apparently been landing since yesterday
8/31/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Oh! How fun! New friends! When does the sound orientation start?
8/31/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Second*
8/31/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Not until next weekend
8/31/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll actually meet the new people until next weekend though
8/31/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôll meet some at the airport because there are 3 other students on Sarah‚Äôs flight from Philly
8/31/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: Oh that's right, I forgot you're sort of picking her up
8/31/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: That'll be nice though
8/31/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  I just have to hope her plane isn‚Äôt delayed
8/31/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Because I have class at 1
8/31/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Is everyone just gonna kind of hang around Budapest until then, or are you planning things?
8/31/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: But like it takes me an hour to get out there on public transit and probably about that to get back‚Äîmaybe more‚Äîbecause AIT has a van to bring us to our apartments but it depends on who else they have to drop off
8/31/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: You mean the new kids?
8/31/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah
8/31/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: I assume they‚Äôre kind of on their own until orientation
8/31/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: Theoretically someone could post in the Facebook group to organize something
8/31/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: But we have no other way to contact them
8/31/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: Ah yeah that does tend to make it hard to organize
8/31/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: And the ones who have been here have class until Thursday still
8/31/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Oh shoot really? That's a lot of class
8/31/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: How's your Hungarian coming along?
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: It honestly hasn‚Äôt felt like that much class
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: And I mean I‚Äôm not conversational
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm picking up off word
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: Odd words**
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: I can count and basically do all the numbers!
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: And have learned a lot of foods
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm enjoying it anyway
8/31/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: I think I may try to take it during the semester as well
8/31/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: But the only thing is, I didn‚Äôt get it approved by the registrar
8/31/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: So I may email them when I actually pick my classes and be like sooo I didn‚Äôt know what I was taking until today
8/31/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Oh that's right, I forgot that you guys haven't gotten classes yet
8/31/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: That's absolutely insane
8/31/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Do you think you'll get to know any of the locals?
8/31/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs starting to be annoying
8/31/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: I may email them and ask if they can release them
8/31/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: Because we can‚Äôt really make travel plans until we know if we have classes on mondays or Fridays and what times you know?
8/31/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: Some kids here stacked their schedule so they have no class on Friday
8/31/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: And I'm so insanely jealous
8/31/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: They have long weekends to travel with! That must be so nice!
8/31/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah I know kids here did that last year
8/31/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: But like I‚Äôm not gonna not take a class that I want just because it‚Äôs Friday afternoon
8/31/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: And as far as getting to know locals: I have my mentor and maybe through the yoga studio?
8/31/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: And woah that is aesthetically pleasing
8/31/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: I really like train stations I think
8/31/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: You'd love this one
8/31/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: It isn't super grandiose, but it's very interesting
8/31/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: And yeah that's what I did
8/31/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: If I have options that make my schedule easier, I'll take them, but also won't avoid classes because in the end I'm here for school
8/31/19, 1:29 PM - Caleb: Update I just saw a guy get on the train, and he was wearing a red hat that said "give stupidity a chance"
8/31/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/31/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: But I am really hoping I can get a pretty convenient schedule
8/31/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Because campus is so far away
8/31/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: So if I have a really early or really late class (or god forbid one of each on the same day), I‚Äôm not gonna be thrilled
8/31/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: And I also can‚Äôt figure out what kind of yoga pass to get until I know classes
8/31/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: Because that changes how many classes I can go to a week
8/31/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: And oh I love the parodies of the make America great again hats
8/31/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve seen a lot of blue ones but with the same font that say make American democratic again
8/31/19, 1:45 PM - Caleb: Update on my day: I've gotten back to N√∏rreport and am now exploring the old city streets
8/31/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna get some schwarma and head back, and get the thiccest nap of the 21st century
8/31/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: Also yeaaaaaaah, it's not super fun having an up and down schedule either
8/31/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: Flip flopping is hard for me like that
8/31/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: But I don't even have a long commute
8/31/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: I was talking with a girl today who has an hour commute to class, and an 8:30
8/31/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Oh I do love a good swarms
8/31/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Swarma
8/31/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: Had the best one in a whole in the wall (lowkey a little sketchy too) in Louisville, Kentucky
8/31/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: You mean like a late start day and then an early start day?
8/31/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: And yeah that‚Äôs that kind of thing I‚Äôm a little worried about
8/31/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: Especially because it‚Äôs all on public transit so if anything gets delayed, you just really have to plan enough time
8/31/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: Swarma place that I wanted to go to was closed :(
8/31/19, 2:10 PM - Caleb: City was cool though
8/31/19, 2:10 PM - Caleb: Theres a lot of shops I want to go to later
8/31/19, 2:10 PM - Caleb: At a time when I'm not super hungry
8/31/19, 2:11 PM - Caleb: But for now, food and a nap are in order
8/31/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds like such a plan
8/31/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm still doing laundry
8/31/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: When I put the next load in, I‚Äôm gonna go to Office Depot and the Hungarian version of cvs
8/31/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: Holy moly
8/31/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: Lots of laundry
8/31/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: That or very slow
8/31/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: Oh
8/31/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: Oh no
8/31/19, 2:27 PM - Caleb: I hope I didn't forget my keys
8/31/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm on my third load
8/31/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: Wait no this is only two
8/31/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: I still have one more to do after
8/31/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: They take like 90 minutes or something
8/31/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: And um yeah I hope you haven‚Äôt forgotten the keys either
8/31/19, 2:28 PM - Caleb: NEVERMIND I HAVE THEM!
8/31/19, 2:28 PM - Caleb: Hooray for hungover Caleb remembering things
8/31/19, 2:29 PM - Marianna: GOOD JOB, HUNGOVER CALEV
8/31/19, 2:29 PM - Marianna: oh dear
8/31/19, 2:29 PM - Marianna: CALEB
8/31/19, 2:30 PM - Marianna: I have to lock my door with my keys on the way out so I‚Äôm going to hope I never forget my keys
8/31/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah yeah that would be kinda hard for you
8/31/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm sure it wouldn't be fun with the landlord trying to get back in
8/31/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: I'm guessing you just have an old fashioned lock
8/31/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Also I totally saw the guy from last night when I was walking back
8/31/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: He went "hahaha how are you feeling this morning" and I just answered "unfortunate"
8/31/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Also sweet lord these tacos are incredible
8/31/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: You mean like a pin and tumblers lock?
8/31/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Yes
8/31/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Two of them!
8/31/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: I also have like an old fashioned key for a gate
8/31/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Good ole fun
8/31/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Yeah I might have slapped him or answered back much for sassy than that
8/31/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Yay for tacos!
8/31/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: You got any plans today besides laundry?
8/31/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Hans wants to go to ikea but I don‚Äôt want to without robin
8/31/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: But not really
8/31/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Maybe going out tonight
8/31/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Probably going out tonight
8/31/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: Aha
8/31/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: Well have fun! Ruin bar?
8/31/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: Also, I feel like waiting for Ikea is a good call
8/31/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: It depends
8/31/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: Then Sarah can come and yall can ~decorate ~
8/31/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: Robins not here so it will just be me and the guys and they might have already have plans
8/31/19, 3:09 PM - Marianna: And well Hans wanted to wok tomorrow so I feel bad being like nah I won‚Äôt go with ya
8/31/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: But yeah I kind of also want to go with Sarah
8/31/19, 3:12 PM - Caleb: Awh well it'll still be fun
8/31/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: Robin a big partier?
8/31/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: Probably on par with me
8/31/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs more like she‚Äôs the only other girl we go out with
8/31/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: Small group so far
8/31/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: I want more people!
8/31/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Is your program a majority male?
8/31/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: I think so
8/31/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: At least in the language program
8/31/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: Not to bad but maybe 60/40 or less
8/31/19, 3:18 PM - Marianna: I think it should even out in the real part
8/31/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: Ahh that's not too bad at all
8/31/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: I swear mines like 70/30 female male
8/31/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: It's insane
8/31/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: For a while I was the only guy Reid met
8/31/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: Also, I think I'm gonna take that nap now
8/31/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you later!
8/31/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: I hate to say it but I might blame the psych program
8/31/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Lot more females in psych
8/31/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: And okay nap away!
8/31/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: I may nap at some point too
8/31/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: Office Depot was a success!  Getting contact lens solution was not. All I could find was the kind I‚Äôm allergic to so this might be a problem
8/31/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Oh hello! I just woke up
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: Like literally thirty seconds aho
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: Uncanny timing
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: Then I walked through this cute little market on the way back!  Didn‚Äôt buy anything because I‚Äôm gonna go back with Sarah but some stalls had art and jewelry and some had like old Soviet things
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: You know
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: Great minds
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: ... Finish each other's sandwiches yeah yeah
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: No no
8/31/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: I reject using that reference here
8/31/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs all part of my protest of the movie
8/31/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: ThAtS wHaT I wAs gOnNa sAy
8/31/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: And oh no! Glasses Marianna is making a comeback
8/31/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: I hope you're able to be productive despite a lack of contact fluid
8/31/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Also that market sounds super cool! Old soviet stuff is so much fun
8/31/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Years ago I bought Calvin an old soviet liquidator medal for Christmas
8/31/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: And just the amount of history behind it was incredible, not to mention _a e s t h e t i c_
8/31/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Glasses Marianna is NOT making a comeback
8/31/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: I will have a semester of itchy eyes if need be
8/31/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: They had tables of medals and things but idk how real any of it can be
8/31/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Like it might be
8/31/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Or it could totally be fake
8/31/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Or maybe just the aesthetic as you say is what makes it cool
8/31/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Also!  Guess what I‚Äôm doing now
8/31/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhhhhhhh I'm gonna guess petting a dog
8/31/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: But more realistically gossip girl, a nap, or yoga
8/31/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Ha!  I have foooled you once again!
8/31/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Putting up photos!
8/31/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: Heyyyyyyy that's fun
8/31/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: Send a picture when you're done!
8/31/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: Or just work in progress pics
8/31/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: Oh Marianna
8/31/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: Oh no
8/31/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: Marion apparently reminded Reid that I promised her we'd go out and party together this weekend
8/31/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: Oh please no
8/31/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Oh you‚Äôre a dead man
8/31/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: Marion does not take kindly to people not going out with her
8/31/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: She will goade you with her puppy dogs eyes and vodka
8/31/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: And I actually may not go out tonight I just feel like there aren‚Äôt that many people here and I wasn‚Äôt to go to church and the market tomorrow and I like waking up and being productive not hungover
8/31/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll just people watch with a class of wine
8/31/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: Like out my window
8/31/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: Well Marion can try
8/31/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: I also might be hanging out with Margaux tonight
8/31/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: I'm trying to survive though
8/31/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: If I go to a bar I'll just have a club soda or something
8/31/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: And people watching is always a good time! It's what I did after my nap for a little bit
8/31/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Enjoy your class of wine and some interesting Hungarians
8/31/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: OH I KNOW WHAT IM GONNA DO
8/31/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna watch burlesque
8/31/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll go get some rum as well
8/31/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: I need to before Sarah gets here and idk if they‚Äôre open Sunday
8/31/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: C a p t a i n
8/31/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: Also, burlesque as in a burlesque show?
8/31/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: No no as in the movie
8/31/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Which is about a burlesque show
8/31/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Or the bar
8/31/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs got good music
8/31/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: And Cher and Christina Aguilera
8/31/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Can't say I've seen it
8/31/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: And that makes a lot more sense, I was preeeetty surprised you were into that sort of thing
8/31/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Or that they're still around in general
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: Eh I don‚Äôt think burlesque is bad
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs classy?
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: Gentleman‚Äôs clubs are a different thing
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I wasn't saying it was bad
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Just a little old fashion
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: And not what I'd think you'd enjoy
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve seen so many strip bars around here though
8/31/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: And what do you mean! It's a gentleman's club! Isn't that where you go get served by men in suits and white gloves and stuff?
8/31/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm not sure they are around anymore
8/31/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Now that I would be fine with
8/31/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Sounds like a good time to me
8/31/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: And they‚Äôre all named harvest
8/31/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Jarvis
8/31/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Oh gosh autocorrect
8/31/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: People probably go in there and go "_MMM YES THE ECONOMY_ "
8/31/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Ah heck it didn't italicize
8/31/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: We're having all sorts of formatting issues today
8/31/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Jarvis? Odd name for a strip club
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Does it mean anything in Hungarian?
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: No I meant the men in suits were named Jarvis
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhh
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Yes
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Naturally
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: _naturally_
8/31/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: They only serve cognac or bourbon
8/31/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had cognac or bourbon
8/31/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: I've had bourbon before
8/31/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: It tastes a lot like scotch
8/31/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Oh boooooo scotch
8/31/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: It was a really really nice glass too
8/31/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Thanks Calvin's gramps
8/31/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: _Naturally_
8/31/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Oh that makes sense
8/31/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: He took us out for dinner and got a glass, and was like "Caleb do you want to try it", so I did, and he goes "wow, you didn't even flinch!"
8/31/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: ... I was in college
8/31/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Ha
8/31/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Got to love the giveaways
8/31/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: He sounded more impressed than anything
8/31/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Yeah
8/31/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm pretty sure I would still flinch
8/31/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Eh it was odd
8/31/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: It was smoked, and it really sat on the tongue well
8/31/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: And I like distinct flavors, so it was up my alley
8/31/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: I don't think I'd buy a nice bottle for myself though
8/31/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Oh I do like smoky flavors
8/31/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm watching murder mystery now
8/31/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: If you don‚Äôt end up going out tonight, would you like to chat tonight?
8/31/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Sure! I'd love to! My only tentative plan was that I was going to hang out with Margaux, but I'm not going to be out all night
8/31/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Yay!
8/31/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Just let me know!
8/31/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not going out tonight so I‚Äôll be right here
8/31/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Well I might shower at some point
8/31/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: At some point like today?
8/31/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: What's the time from here
8/31/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Are we talking on a Marion scale?
8/31/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Yeah like I showered yesterday so I should shower tonight
8/31/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: We are nowhere near Marion‚Äôs scale
8/31/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: Okay good good
8/31/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: I was soooo worried üòÅ
8/31/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Also, do you know anything about vintage lenses?
8/31/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: I do not
8/31/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: I am sorry
8/31/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: You thinking of getting one?
8/31/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: Okay
8/31/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: Well
8/31/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: There's this one called the Helios 44-2
8/31/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: And it's a vintage Russian lens
8/31/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: Hey mr hall counselor I have a question for a poor foolish freshman boy
8/31/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: It has a REALLY cool bokeh effect
8/31/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: OH love me some bokeh
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: That's what it looks like
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: Do all lenses work with all cameras though?
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: Or is it just for a film camera?
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: It's an M42 mount
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: But you can grab an adapter
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: And it fits on F mount then
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: THE BEST PART??
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: It's $60!
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: And oh christ Joey
8/31/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah what's up hit me with it
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds pretty sweet
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Well he says his arm hurts and won‚Äôt really bend and he‚Äôs got a cut on his hand and he has no idea how any of that happened
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Go to the health center
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: But basically, the health center is closed today right?
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: They don't ask questions and he can't get in trouble
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
8/31/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Can he call the on call?
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Yeah he asked that and I told him not to worry they don‚Äôt care
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Yeah call the on call
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll tell him
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Hang on
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Hopefully they don‚Äôt send him to the hospital
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Is it developing? Bleeding?
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Infected?
8/31/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Idk
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: If it doesn't need medical attention right away, they'll probably just tell you what to do
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Call regardless
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think so. He just complained about basically what I sent you
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: Yeah that makes sense
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: And either they'll walk him through how to take care of it, or they'll come check it out
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: I had a first aid kit with me in college
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: 100% he didn‚Äôt bring one
8/31/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah I did too
8/31/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Did I ever tell you about the time I pulled broken glass out of someone's foot?
8/31/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Yes I think so
8/31/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: I never did that for anyone
8/31/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
8/31/19, 8:39 PM - Caleb: Freshman year I was basically the medic of first rich
8/31/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not an awful place to be
8/31/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: As long as people aren‚Äôt constantly doing dumb things
8/31/19, 8:45 PM - Caleb: Certainly not
8/31/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: I doth not believeth you
8/31/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: CERTAINLY not
8/31/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: #Subfreelyfe
8/31/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I DOTH NOTH BELIEVERH YOU
8/31/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Well HA because we totally weren't
8/31/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: It hurts to sing
8/31/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: I hate when that happens
8/31/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: We won the football game by the way
8/31/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Lets gooooooo cats
8/31/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: #BenHeuserVoice
8/31/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Also SING YOUR HEART OUT!
8/31/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Just don't lose too much of you voice
8/31/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: Oh my goodness what team
8/31/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôd we manage that
8/31/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm shook
8/31/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah I don‚Äôt think my throat is too happy with me currently
8/31/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Georgetown!
8/31/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Do you think you're getting sick?
8/31/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs just more of the same
8/31/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Allergies
8/31/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: :(
8/31/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: :(((
8/31/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: NO ALLERGIES
8/31/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: BAD
8/31/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
8/31/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm all good
8/31/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna drink some orange juice
8/31/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: That fixes everything
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: No no no
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Warm milk
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Orange juice is acidic, it will make it worse
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Maybe
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: I think
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: But it has vitamin c
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I thought that was good
8/31/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: And I like orange juice
8/31/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll have warm milk
8/31/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Although that may put me to sleep
8/31/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: It's a tradeoff
8/31/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: I'm sure you'll be okay
8/31/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: No Caleb I‚Äôm gonna die
8/31/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: But!  How has the rest of your day been?  Feeling any better?
8/31/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Uh hang on, I'm on a fight in Instagram DMs
8/31/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Hypothetically
8/31/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Could a dog rule an Italian city
8/31/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: No
8/31/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: But I have heard that there was this old Italian religious dude who‚Äôs name was a doge
8/31/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs about though
8/31/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: Hmmm idk either
8/31/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: I think she's full of crap, pardon my French
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: :(
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Also, imagine being named "Doge"
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: I thinks she‚Äôs wonderful
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: That was their title!
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Me too but don't tell her that
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: !!!!
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Nah I have no secrets with my friends
8/31/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Shhh no I have a crush on her
8/31/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: If she finds out I'll get embarrassed
8/31/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Oh! And also my day was pretty good
8/31/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: The nap cured me
8/31/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Naps fix all
8/31/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: And then I just hung around and read, and then went and got a mcflurry
8/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: She won‚Äôt mind I don‚Äôt think
8/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: You might get embarrassed
8/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: But you‚Äôll get over it I think
8/31/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Naps do fix!!  All!!
8/31/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: But now I have burlesque and a mug of warm milk (thanks for the suggestion)
8/31/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: No problem! Warm milk is heavenly
8/31/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: OJ helps if you're getting sick, but the acid doesn't do wonders for inflammation
8/31/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: I have a big bottle of water and bachelor in paradise
8/31/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: The Danes are always surprisingly into it
8/31/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Ha
8/31/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad your giving THEM the culture shock
8/31/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Youre**
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: It's actually embarrassing how into this I'm getting
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: I totally get the appeal
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: NOOOOOO
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: It's absolute trash
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Caleb
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Yes
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: But really entertaining trash
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: As long as you have that in your sight
8/31/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: NO
8/31/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
8/31/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
8/31/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: It's a social thing
8/31/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I swear!
8/31/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: okay
8/31/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: Sure
8/31/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: I believe you I do
8/31/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve seen people fall victim to this show too many times
8/31/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: It starts as whatever
8/31/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: And then BOOM
8/31/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: it‚Äôs a regular thing
8/31/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: And then there‚Äôs an issue!
8/31/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: Actually I‚Äôm kidding it‚Äôs just trash but I see that it can be amusing to watch
8/31/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: WATCH AN EPISODE WITH ME!
8/31/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Jk you'd probably just die
8/31/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôll do it if you really want to
8/31/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Look
8/31/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: I'd enjoy it
8/31/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Probably not for the show though
8/31/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Why would you enjoy it then
8/31/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Good company!
8/31/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: A show is not worth watching unless it‚Äôs a good show
8/31/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Duuh
8/31/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Oh well I guess that works
8/31/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: I still would rather watch a good show with good company
8/31/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Well
8/31/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: I'm sure you can arrange that
8/31/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: We do have a list of sorts
8/31/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: I hope
8/31/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: So! How's your night going?
8/31/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Good
8/31/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Very chill
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Marianna: But a good one
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: That's good
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Chill is fun
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs surprisingly quiet outside
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your night?
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Oh really? For a Saturday night or just in general?
8/31/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: My nights good! Also very chill
8/31/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: I'll definitely take very chill
8/31/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: In general honestly
8/31/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: I can really hear anything outside
8/31/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Marianna
8/31/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Why am I so bad at remembering keys
8/31/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: What the hell
8/31/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: How do I get better at this
8/31/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: What's the secret
8/31/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Keys
8/31/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: As in music keys
8/31/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: As in help I always get locked out keys
8/31/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Or as in door keys
8/31/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Oh
8/31/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Also I can't remember musical keys too well
8/31/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: But that's less of a problem in my life at the moment
8/31/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Ah
8/31/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: You should be better at this considering part of your job is to unlock people who are locked out
8/31/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: You see
8/31/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: You're right
8/31/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: ... I was typing up a long excuse, but you're right
8/31/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Also, you still up for a call?
8/31/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Ha!  I am usually right
8/31/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a habit I have cultivated very well over the years
8/31/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: And yeah let me shower and take my contacts out so like 20 minutes?
8/31/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Sounds good!
8/31/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: And I've DEFINITELY been right on some things
8/31/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Which is odd for me
8/31/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: I usually don't have an awesome track record
8/31/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: I thought we agree you had genius status
8/31/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: (Or am I not supposed to say that in front of your ego?)
8/31/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: You know
8/31/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: First off Id say I disagree
8/31/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Second, yeah probably not the greatest thing for the ego
8/31/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Okay well you are allowed to do that sometimes
8/31/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Ready for a call?
8/31/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: But hey feed the ego starve the soul or something
8/31/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Actually I was wondering if I could grab a quick shower, like 5 minutes?
8/31/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: I had to give my friend my raincoat so he could get home
8/31/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: So I got delayed a lil
8/31/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Yes yes I‚Äôll be here
8/31/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Probably awake
8/31/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Probably?? Oh geez I'll hurt
8/31/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Hury
8/31/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Hurry, not hurt
8/31/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Goodness
8/31/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: No hurt
8/31/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt have to hurry I‚Äôll probs still be here
9/1/19, 1:19 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm gonna take that as the universes way of telling us to go to bed
9/1/19, 1:19 AM - Marianna: So goodnight!
9/1/19, 1:19 AM - Caleb: Phone died, but yeah I think that's a decent interpretation because I was just gonna ramble on anyway
9/1/19, 1:20 AM - Caleb: Send me the link to the northern lights stuff if you can! Goodnight!
9/1/19, 1:20 AM - Marianna: https://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/northern-lights-europe/
9/1/19, 1:20 AM - Marianna: https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast
9/1/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: God morgen
9/1/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: J√≥ reggelt :)
9/1/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: Update from Brooke, small blonde girl was straddling Joey like sitting on his lap and cuddling up with him on the second floor of f in one of the white chairs
9/1/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: WHAT
9/1/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know what to do about this
9/1/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: Why the hell is she sending you this
9/1/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: Just tell her to stop
9/1/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: That's hyper uncomfy
9/1/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Like, go Joey
9/1/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Be safe and have fun bud
9/1/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: But it's really really weird that she's routinely giving you details about all this
9/1/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Without you asking
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want her to not like me remember
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: So I don‚Äôt want to seem like what the heck
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: You can totally say that without sounding like a dick
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: I also think he took some of my condoms because I had like two strips in my backpack in a box and now there is only one
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: So hopefully he is being safe
9/1/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: Do you want to be getting all of these Joey conquest updates?
9/1/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: Like I kind of like knowing what‚Äôs going on in his life
9/1/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a little uncomfortable
9/1/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: But then I remind myself this is what I was doing at his age
9/1/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: That's okay, but do you want to know his life down to the detail of her hair color and EXACTLY where and what they're doing?
9/1/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: I also got sent pictures of him drinking straight out of a svedka bottle
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: Those I enjoy
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: And this one!
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: From my darling little!
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: Okay that's a fun picture
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: Tell her to clean the sink though
9/1/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: Yeah can‚Äôt send to Judy though
9/1/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: Clean the sink?
9/1/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any of their rooms because it‚Äôs duke
9/1/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: I might ask other informants what small blond girls name is
9/1/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: Then insta stalk her
9/1/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: üòàüòàüòà
9/1/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: Okay now _I'm_ mildly uncomfy geez
9/1/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: Why?
9/1/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: Look, I guess I'm the youngest, and have no younger siblings so I wouldn't get it
9/1/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: Don't worry about it
9/1/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: CaLEB
9/1/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: you know you make me worry about the don‚Äôt worry about it
9/1/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhh sorry about that, I promise it's not a problem
9/1/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: Well the other thing is I don‚Äôt want to tell Brooke to stop because a) id have to talk with her, b) I do want updates on his life‚Äîmaybe not these details‚Äîbut I‚Äôd be worried I wouldn‚Äôt get anything, and c) I guess I‚Äôm kind of rationalizing that if i was there this semester, I‚Äôd see it anyway
9/1/19, 10:21 AM - Marianna: Maybe I should talk to Sam or kate bock about this because they might have gone through a similar thing
9/1/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs kind of a amusing and not like totally cool to see but like im gonna see stuff next semester and year
9/1/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Okay, those are completely understandable reasons
9/1/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: I think if you don't want as much detail, you should definitely let her know though
9/1/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: I could be completely off base because I don't know her well, but the sense of it I'm getting is that she's not doing it out of a genuine "Marianna would like to know this!"
9/1/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: And sorry I said I was uncomfortable, it's just kinda not territory that I've ever known  so when I try to sympathize with Joey in this situation, it's just sort of overwhelming and feels like an invasion of my privacy
9/1/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: But that being said, I don't have the same relationship with my siblings that you and Joey have, so its really not the same at all
9/1/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah I have no idea what her motive is but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good one
9/1/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: She‚Äôs an odd bird though
9/1/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think Joey cares
9/1/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôd be more mad at Brooke than me
9/1/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôd only care if I turned and told the parents
9/1/19, 10:34 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm honestly kind of expecting him to bring small blond girl up at some point with him
9/1/19, 10:34 AM - Marianna: At some point he‚Äôs gonna hit the ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù/‚Äúwhat does this mean?‚Äù And might need my advice
9/1/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: And he clearly knows Brooke is taking videos of him
9/1/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: So if anything, he could tell her to stop
9/1/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna stay out of it as much as can from across the globe
9/1/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: It took me way too long to figure out how to spell globe
9/1/19, 10:37 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhh Joey
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: Young love
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: How sweet
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: I was gonna say so innocent
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: But uhhhh that might not be accurate at all
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: That's definitely not accurate
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Ah yes we both know how phenomenally first week of college relationships work out
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Hey!  Too much!
9/1/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm imagining it‚Äôs all just dancing at f
9/1/19, 10:39 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm coping with it I think
9/1/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Oh I was more talking about alcohol fueled drama
9/1/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: But hey cats are wild or something
9/1/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: And yeah, that might be some quality advice you have to offer Joey
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm debatinf it
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: But that might be unwanted rn
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Well see what happens
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Oh 100%
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: But anyway, enough about my brothers love life
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: If he comes to you for advise, hit him with it though
9/1/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: What do you have planned today?  I‚Äôm pretty sure you said yesterday but I was half asleep maybe
9/1/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: Ah yes, sounds like a good call for 11 in the morning on a Sunday
9/1/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: Well, plans
9/1/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: Sorry to break it to you but I've got a boring Sunday ahead of me
9/1/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: I'm going to clean one of the bathrooms, then maybe go for a bike ride, find a spot to do homework, do homework, and then work out tonight
9/1/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: What about you?
9/1/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: Sounds like a solid Sunday
9/1/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: I just made breakfast
9/1/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: And I may go to a farmers market and then church hopefully and maybe yoga
9/1/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Hey that looks pretty good, solid job
9/1/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: üëçüëç
9/1/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Two thumbs up for scrambled eggs
9/1/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: How's the weather over there? Good day for going out?
9/1/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs 84 degrees
9/1/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: High of 91
9/1/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: So not great
9/1/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: HA
9/1/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: High of 71¬∞ here, and you know what that means
9/1/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: SWEATER WEATHER!
9/1/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: But also I'm sorry that sucks that it's so blazing hot there, but hey it's September so fall is around the corner
9/1/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: I hope
9/1/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: But it might not get cool until October
9/1/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: :(
9/1/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: Too hot?
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Caleb: Hot darn
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: Which is partially why I want to come to Copenhagen in sept
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Caleb: Hey at least you've got quaaaality foliage coming your way
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: I hope so!
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: There are so many trees
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah and that's also why I want to come to to Hungary in October
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm just gonna be in buda all fall
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Caleb: Escape the cold
9/1/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: Ha yeah we can maybe do that for you
9/1/19, 11:08 AM - Caleb: Maaaaaybe
9/1/19, 11:08 AM - Caleb: Just maybe
9/1/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs supposed to cool down on Tuesday
9/1/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: To high seventies
9/1/19, 11:08 AM - Caleb: Oh see that's perfect
9/1/19, 11:08 AM - Caleb: That's golden
9/1/19, 11:09 AM - Marianna: It might just be temporary though
9/1/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: It stays like that, right?
9/1/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: Oh, aw
9/1/19, 11:09 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know
9/1/19, 11:09 AM - Marianna: This is my first rodeo at Hungarian wheather
9/1/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 11:16 AM - Marianna: Well thank you for believing in me
9/1/19, 11:16 AM - Marianna: Looks like I‚Äôm NOT going to survive my rodeo now
9/1/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: That comic is what I think of whenever someone says "ain't my first rodeo"
9/1/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: And I was totally not attempting to call your a clown or say you're gonna die
9/1/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Let the record show, for your own sake I hope you survive the mild Hungarian winter
9/1/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: Oh man, now one of my flatmates is making bacon
9/1/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: It smells incredible
9/1/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: What a good morning
9/1/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Market was a success!
9/1/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Got spinach, raspberries, and corn!
9/1/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: And got to use a little Hungarian
9/1/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: But I spent a whopping 1420 forints
9/1/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Aka like <$5
9/1/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: But oh the smell of bacon is pretty incredible
9/1/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: I also hope I survive
9/1/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: I have faith
9/1/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: Yay for dirt cheap Hungarian farmers markets!
9/1/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: I should probably make lunch at some point
9/1/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: But also I'm lazy
9/1/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: It's the eternal delimma
9/1/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: But food is good
9/1/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: They look they they‚Äôd rhyme
9/1/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: They don‚Äôt
9/1/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: But they do go together!
9/1/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: You know, if you say enough things weirdly, you can make _anything_ rhyme
9/1/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: That's the magic of it!
9/1/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre not wrong
9/1/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
9/1/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Do both and wolf rhyme for me
9/1/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I think they do
9/1/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I don't know what to do with this information
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not natural
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: You have twisted the English language
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: It was already twisted
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: And you took it a step farther
9/1/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: AH
9/1/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Man, I don't know why but I'm just not in a great mood this morning
9/1/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Somethings not sitting right in my brain and I can't figure it out
9/1/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
9/1/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the most frustrating thing
9/1/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/1/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Its sort of one of those days I just want to escape
9/1/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm getting a recap of Reids night with Marion
9/1/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Apparently they were clubbing until 4:30
9/1/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Give me the recap of the recap?
9/1/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Well
9/1/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: He wanted a more chill night
9/1/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: And Marion told him to at least come to the pregame with him
9/1/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: So he said he would, and he'd come back and hang with us after
9/1/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: And I was just like
9/1/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: "probably not gonna happen, good luck"
9/1/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: And she talked him into clubbing with them
9/1/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: And it was a REALLY crazy, high energy one with strobe lights
9/1/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: Basically a rave
9/1/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: And Reid doesn't even like dancing like
9/1/19, 1:28 PM - Caleb: So basically the whole night, he was kinda working "security" for them and trying to keep creepy guys away
9/1/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Ah yes!  That sounds like a classic Marion night out!
9/1/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah we usually need our guy friends for Marion
9/1/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: And Mitch did it for everyone in the friend group
9/1/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: Aw, well that's awfully sweet of him
9/1/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry if he didn‚Äôt have a fun time though
9/1/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: Kinda scary though considering Reid barely knows any of them
9/1/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: Well he seems trustworthy to me
9/1/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: He shouldn‚Äôt have to but if he doesn‚Äôt mind
9/1/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good thing for him to do
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah he is, but it's hard to make that judgment after 2 weeks
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: What adjustment?
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: Judgment
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Oh I totally just read that word wrong
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: If someone is trustworthy
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: My b
9/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Got it
9/1/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: But yeah, he said he didn't have a _bad_ night, it just wasn't what he was looking for
9/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: I think I have a good first impression/judgement of people
9/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Aw well that‚Äôs still unfortunate if it‚Äôs not what you wanted or expected
9/1/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: Yeah he really wasn't ready
9/1/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: I almost want to go clubbing tonight
9/1/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: Maybe I can get robin to want to
9/1/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Almost?
9/1/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: Well it‚Äôs Sunday
9/1/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Yeaaaah
9/1/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: You've got class tomorrow don't you?
9/1/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: Not until 1pm
9/1/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: But robin gets back today from the lake so idk if she‚Äôd be down
9/1/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: But I do love dancing
9/1/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: How are you feeling about the lake?
9/1/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm fine
9/1/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: It would have been cool to go
9/1/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt know I would have liked it
9/1/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah, there'll be other opportunities for stuff like that later in the semester too
9/1/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: Especially when you have a more established friend group
9/1/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs true
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Marianna: But I really like dancing
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Caleb: Then dance
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Caleb: Be a dancing queen!
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Caleb: Listen to ABBA!
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Marianna: But I like the energy of a room full of dancing people
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Marianna: Or shiny happy people dancing
9/1/19, 1:44 PM - Caleb: Shiny?
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Marianna: But yeah I could just have a dance party if one in my apartment
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Marianna: Shiny!
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Marianna: Is that not how you spell it
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Caleb: ... It's just not the word that I'd think of
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Caleb: Sweaty?
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a song
9/1/19, 1:45 PM - Marianna: REM
9/1/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: AH yeah sorry I missed that
9/1/19, 1:46 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okaaaaay
9/1/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: I'm slackin
9/1/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: And I do too! I've got to be with the right people though
9/1/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: And everyone's gotta be on the same wavelength
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: Otherwise it's just ehhhhhhhh
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll forgive you
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Marianna: I honestly miss f
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: Oh I totally don't
9/1/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: I'm not a huge fan, ngl
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Marianna: But I like it for dancing
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Marianna: And the energy
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Marianna: And the friends
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Oh I like ryburn and other senior apps for the energy and dancing
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: F ain't it chief
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Not for me, not usually
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Unless it's Halloweekend
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Marianna: I have only be to ryburn like once
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: You're missing out
9/1/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Lots of elevated surfaced to dance on
9/1/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: I hate the masses and nastiness of f
9/1/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: But I still like it
9/1/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: I like court house parties best though
9/1/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: Really?  I didn‚Äôt think ryburn did
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: F has its own charm
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: It's like Philly
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: No no
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: The grime is part of the appeal
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: And also nothing good happens after 2 am
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Well maybe I don‚Äôt know philly well enough
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: I love f in the morning
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so classy
9/1/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Trash everywhere
9/1/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: Broken tables and other random things
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna go ahead and say that was sarcasm
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Caleb: Maybe, just _maybe_ sarcasm
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Caleb: Also, I've got a question for you
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a weird vibe
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: Not class though
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: And shoot!
9/1/19, 2:05 PM - Caleb: It's not so much a question as a thinly veiled confession
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Have you ever been cleaning a bathroom, and you're polishing the handles on the shower, and accidentally turn it on when you're standing in it while fully clothed
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: ...no
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Cool
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: No that‚Äôs not normal
9/1/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: How you doin over there Caleb
9/1/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: That's funny because I haven't either _hahahahahawhydoyouask_
9/1/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: Ehem well you did say confession
9/1/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: FOOLED yourself there bud
9/1/19, 2:11 PM - Caleb: "thinly veiled" confession excuse you
9/1/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/1/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: That supports what I was saying
9/1/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: Anyway
9/1/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna go sit at a little coffee shop hopefully because they have hammock chairs outside
9/1/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: And read or write in my journal
9/1/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: Hopefully one is vacant
9/1/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: Okay, have fun! I'm probably gonna just get away from here for a few hours
9/1/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mean to stress you out but have you started any of that homework you mentioned
9/1/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah I finished it actually
9/1/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: I think I just need to leave for a while, fresh air and nature always help
9/1/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs kind of how I felt
9/1/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: And this coffee is cheaper than the one below me
9/1/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: And I love hammocks
9/1/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: And this is my view currently
9/1/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Woah, that's not too shabby
9/1/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Is that the architecture in most of Budapest?
9/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Depends
9/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Most of this district was bombed out
9/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Hence the ruin bars
9/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Actually a good portion of the whole city was bombed out
9/1/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: So most everything has either been restored or left to the ruinous state
9/1/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: So I doubt this building is what the original looked like
9/1/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: Man
9/1/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: History like that is so interesting
9/1/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: That's so awesome you get to live in such a cool place
9/1/19, 3:44 PM - Marianna: I know!
9/1/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: I know I haven‚Äôt explored a lot but just walking to do errands amazed me
9/1/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: And today hopefully I‚Äôm going to mass at the basilica named after the first king of Hungary who brought Catholicism to the country
9/1/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt been inside yet
9/1/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: But the national holiday from my first week here is named after him
9/1/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: What time is mass?
9/1/19, 3:54 PM - Caleb: Also, I absolutely love cathedrals
9/1/19, 3:54 PM - Caleb: I hope it's a cool one, probably very Gothic?
9/1/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: Maybe 5
9/1/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: My dad thought it was 4:30 so I‚Äôm heading there now
9/1/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: And well it‚Äôs a basilica not a cathedral
9/1/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/1/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs like a slight difference that I don‚Äôt remember
9/1/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: And I don‚Äôt know I haven‚Äôt been inside yet but I hear it‚Äôs beautiful
9/1/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: If I get there early, I‚Äôm gonna take pictures
9/1/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: Send some pictures! I hope it's a good service
9/1/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: I turned my phone off and have been hanging out in this gorgeous park, reading
9/1/19, 5:32 PM - Marianna: Good service!
9/1/19, 5:32 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 5:32 PM - Marianna: Not the best shot but I have to get home and cook so I didn‚Äôt take many photos this time but I‚Äôll be back
9/1/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: So I went to the English community mass
9/1/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: And made the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù of sitting in front of one of the guys who puts the mass together
9/1/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: And he told me I should join the choir
9/1/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: And I told him I‚Äôd love to help out although I usually do readings at mass and not singing
9/1/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: And he messaged me on WhatsApp to coordinate helping next weekend and invite me to the community tea with the priest and everything. So it looks like I‚Äôm also gonna be connecting with locals (or at least English-speaking ones) this way too
9/1/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: WOO WOOOOOO
9/1/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: THAT'S AWESOME
9/1/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: I'm so happy to hear that!
9/1/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: And like I‚Äôm not sure I would have volunteered my first weekend but this is almost like a calling from god or as close as you can get to help out you know
9/1/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/1/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah I don't think it can get much more clear for you
9/1/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: So that‚Äôs cool!
9/1/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the park?
9/1/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Fantastic! It got cold and started raining so I left a while ago
9/1/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: But it was nice
9/1/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: A little crowded, but it's a Sunday afternoon so hey
9/1/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: The pictures are downloading right now, but I'll send them in a second
9/1/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Also, could we figure out what days I'm/you're/were traveling and visiting? People are in my flat making concrete plans for our week off and I figured we should probably snag tickets early-ish
9/1/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: PH MY GOODNESS THAT PARK IS BEAUTIFUL
9/1/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: I LOVE IT
9/1/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: AND THE PHOTOS
9/1/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: and so I cannot really get tickets until I get my classes
9/1/19, 6:34 PM - Marianna: But for when you visit, you can come and go whenever works best for you and spyros that end of the week/weekend
9/1/19, 6:34 PM - Marianna: Is that part of your week off?
9/1/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm going to get there sometime in September probably the last weekend or second to last weekend. I need to talk to Sarah though and run it by my parents but I will get you a date this week?
9/1/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: And then the nov/dec weekend
9/1/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: And I think that‚Äôs all
9/1/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: I know it‚Äôs still not very concrete
9/1/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: I really can‚Äôt plan until I know what my schedule is
9/1/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Does that help at all?
9/1/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: Yeah it was just what I needed I think
9/1/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: To sit down with a good book in a beautiful place
9/1/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: Also there are some drop-dead spots in Copenhagen, and I'm starting to get REALLY excited to explore it
9/1/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: People keep talking about wanting to leave and travel every weekend, but we don't have much time, and I'm starting to lean towards the idea of being a little more intimately familiar with Copenhagen than have a shallow experience across Europe
9/1/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: Like, I can pick any city to vacation in for a week for the rest of my life, but living somewhere is a lot more special
9/1/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: And there's a billion gems here that I'd kick myself for missing, like the Cisterns! Or beautiful old churches! Or castles and moats and whatnot!
9/1/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: Also, that's totally fine with what you just told me, I get that it's hard to schedule unless you know your schedule haha
9/1/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: And yeah, the week off I guess is my biggest unknown
9/1/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: My week off is Oct 8-13, so just let me know how much of that you'd be able to have me for
9/1/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: I definitely wouldn't want to get in the way of classes or anything, and also might need to cut the weekend a little short (like a day) if I have a deadline to get to China
9/1/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs kind of how I feel about Budapest
9/1/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Or I might just want to spend some weekends getting up early and getting an early train to like Romania or something and do soemthing there for a day
9/1/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: And moats!  You have moats?!?!
9/1/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: You can come down whenever if convenient for you
9/1/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: I kind of liked the Thursday idea
9/1/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: But whatever works best for your schedule/with your flat mates works!
9/1/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get in the way of classes, I just may be on campus for most of the day depending on what I do to my schedule
9/1/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: But again, don‚Äôt know :(
9/1/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: ALSO HEY
9/1/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: CALEB
9/1/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: ‚ÄúPERCIVAL‚Äù

9/1/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: I made pan seared salmon with teriyaki because I'm lazy
9/1/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Salmon tastes a lil too fishy
9/1/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna pick some fresh stuff up at the fish market this week and make a lemon garlic and butter sauce
9/1/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Also holy COw that looks tasty
9/1/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Also re: Cooking with Marianna, yeah I wasn't ready for this but I'm still glad its happening
9/1/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>

9/1/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Fantastic show
9/1/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Also, Emil walked into the apartment and was like "so I heard you had a rough night on Friday"
9/1/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Can you just shoot me already
9/1/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/1/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: If it makes you feel better
9/1/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Everyone has rough nights
9/1/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Also
9/1/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Which photo for my food story
9/1/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Oh and look at my salad
9/1/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: I know you‚Äôre gonna have salad envy
9/1/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Photo 1 for the story
9/1/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: With the rainbks
9/1/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: And Marianna
9/1/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Is that straight up just salad, raspberries, and vinaigrette?
9/1/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/1/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Doesn‚Äôt it look yummy
9/1/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs all from the market today
9/1/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Simplicity at its finest
9/1/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Good presentation
9/1/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: I feel like you have a little more room in there though
9/1/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: But I guess it's hard with your list of allergies :(
9/1/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/1/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: I like simple salads though
9/1/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Fruit and croutons and cheese are pretty much it
9/1/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: And corn
9/1/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: And tomatoes
9/1/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Aha, I see
9/1/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Well congrats
9/1/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: You did it
9/1/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: I've got salad envy
9/1/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: But I'm pretty full right now so it's not too bad
9/1/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Also, have you met someone in Budapest named Zoe Walling by any chance
9/1/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/1/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: I win
9/1/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm also STUFFED

9/1/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Ah, it's someone I know from high school
9/1/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: I just saw she's in Budapest right now!
9/1/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Idk if she's studying abroad there though
9/1/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Also have fun clubbing! Going anywhere new?
9/1/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Wild
9/1/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Well if she is, I will probably end up meeting her!
9/1/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  We‚Äôre gonna try the party hostel
9/1/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: They always seem very lit
9/1/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: They have like a dance floor on the main floor
9/1/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah I saw her post at the szechenyi thermal baths?
9/1/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know where that is yet
9/1/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: Ah, well, if you bump into her say hi for me
9/1/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: We have the same birthday, fun fact
9/1/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: But anyway, have fun clubbing! When are you heading out?
9/1/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Woah
9/1/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna bump into her and wish her a happy birthday and freak her out that I know
9/1/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: Oh my God that would be incredible
9/1/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm heading over to her place at 9:30 but we‚Äôre gonna do a liquor store run and pregame beforehand
9/1/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: LIGHT pregaming that is
9/1/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: And Ooooooo slippery slope incoming
9/1/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: You getting rum?

9/1/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: SHOOKETH
9/1/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: baaaaamBOOZLED
9/1/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Is it just you two going out?
9/1/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: I think so
9/1/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: wow
9/1/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: You are easy to bamboozle
9/1/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: No offense
9/1/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: But a blind man could have seen that coming
9/1/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Okay, stay safe and let me know when you're back!
9/1/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Have you ever seen "Singing in the Rain"?
9/1/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: YES
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Well I just watched like the last 30 minutes of it
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: And now I really want to see the first part
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: The LAST 30
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: HOW
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: CAN
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: YOU
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: YOU
9/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: MONSTER
9/1/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: MONSTER
9/1/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: I'M SORRY
9/1/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: I'll get around to watching it eventually
9/1/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: I promise
9/1/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Also now they're putting on La La Land
9/1/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: I'm just tryna do homework
9/1/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: ...homework due TUESDAY
9/1/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: LA LA LAAAAAND TIME
9/1/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: I love this soundtrack too much
9/1/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Never seen the movie though
9/1/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/1/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: MONSTER
9/1/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: on both accounts of the homework doing and the never seeing that movie
9/1/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I actually like all of the movie but the last 10 minutes
9/1/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: So have fun
9/1/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/1/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: Oh geez
9/1/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: I don't know if I'm ready for this one now
9/1/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: The soundtrack is a BOP
9/1/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: Peter knows every song, he's very animated and into it
9/1/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: A show on his own, some might say
9/1/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: Peter?
9/1/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: Do you know the story at all?
9/1/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: I also love most of the soundtrack
9/1/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: Better than the movie
9/1/19, 9:19 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I just play the movie in the background to listen to the music
9/1/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Besides it's a romance musical, nope
9/1/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Clueless
9/1/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: And Peter! He's one of the Danes living in Hannah and Loraine's flat
9/1/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll do homework and just listen then
9/1/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: But I feel like I need to see the movie out of obligation!
9/1/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Oh clueless is another good movie
9/1/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Oh got it!
9/1/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Is loraine in your building?
9/1/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Whiiiich I haven't seen
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: (surprise)
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah! She's Hannah's flatmate
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: They live like 3 floors up
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: I thought it was kind of random that she was over and you guys bumped into each other but that makes sense now
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah you have to watch the movie to get the story
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Just have tissues ready
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Kidding I didn‚Äôt really cry
9/1/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: I was more angry at it
9/1/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: What, Clueless, or La La Land?
9/1/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: La la land now
9/1/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Clueless later
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs actually kind of a fluff movie
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a classic
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah we're gonna be friends this semester
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: Also I did a dumb I missed my tram and now I have to wait like 8 minutes
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: NOOOO
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: Like it was here but I didn‚Äôt know it was the one I wanted
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: And I figured it out as it was leaving
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: EVEN MORE NOOOOO
9/1/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: Also are you good friends with Loraine?
9/1/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: We say hi to each other I think
9/1/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: She hypes me up at f
9/1/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs really good friends with Betsy‚Äôs and Maggie‚Äôs freshmen year roommates so we interacted a good bit
9/1/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Goooo loraaaine
9/1/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Yeah so far I like her a lot
9/1/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: It's the Davidson crowd
9/1/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: I'm a huge fan just naturally
9/1/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: I love Davidson people
9/1/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: I miss Davidson people
9/1/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: I miss people
9/1/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: I WANT PEOPLE
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: YOU'LL HAVE PEOPLE
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Soon! ‚Ñ¢
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: I WANT THEM NOW
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: I'm already so excited to be back for next semester
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: All my frens
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Not that I'm discontent here
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Yeah I miss people
9/1/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Ya know how it is
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: But I think everyone honestly needs the time away from each other
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: You're such a social butterfly
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Oh 100%
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: At least in my friendgeoup
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Same here
9/1/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: We were hitting critical mass for a bit
9/1/19, 9:33 PM - Marianna: It happened between sophomore and junior year in high school too
9/1/19, 9:33 PM - Marianna: For my group
9/1/19, 9:33 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like 2 years is the carrying capacity
9/1/19, 9:33 PM - Marianna: Although I‚Äôm pretty sure my group will meld back together pretty well
9/1/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Yeah, time heals all sounds
9/1/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Wounds *
9/1/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: I was like sounds?
9/1/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: There are definitely some hurt feelings still though
9/1/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: But hey! I'm looking forward to being back
9/1/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: A handful of friends are getting a house off campus with a big back yard
9/1/19, 9:36 PM - Caleb: So there'll be lots of smores and campfires
9/1/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Okay update: this movie is pretty damn good
9/1/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: As someone that really really loves jazz, it's a beaut
9/1/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Oh yes the jazz is good in it
9/1/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: I love the little bit that Ryan gosling plays on the piano
9/1/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Also
9/1/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: The captain has her rum
9/1/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: And some ginger ale and boy you can‚Äôt taste it
9/1/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Rum in belly?
9/1/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: On its way
9/1/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Godspeed
9/1/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: True
9/1/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: How's your night so far?
9/1/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: Good
9/1/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Anything particular happening? You at Robin's?
9/1/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: On the way to get alc two guys came up to robin and me on the street and asked if we wanted to hook up with them
9/1/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre back at nine
9/1/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Whew
9/1/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: That's awfully direct
9/1/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Nine is the club?
9/1/19, 10:47 PM - Caleb: WHAT IS THIS BULLSHIT ENDING
9/1/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN THE WORLD
9/1/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Wait what is this mintage
9/1/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Montage
9/1/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah I was kind of like uh no thank you
9/1/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: And robin was like wait what did they ask
9/1/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: And I was like oh I didn‚Äôt consult you but I assume you also didn‚Äôt want to
9/1/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: And no I mean mine
9/1/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: As in my apartment
9/1/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Have you finished the montage?!?!
9/1/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/1/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Oh God
9/1/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/1/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I'm fucking wrecked
9/1/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: It's been a long time since a movie did a number like that on me
9/1/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: I've never loved and hated something so much at the same time
9/1/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I know right?!
9/1/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I hated the end
9/1/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: HATED
9/1/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: BUT IT'S SO GOOD
9/1/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: It just hurt me
9/1/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: A lot
9/1/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: The montage was brutal
9/1/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Absolutely brutal
9/1/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I was confused and hopeful and then it shattered, just all over the floor
9/1/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: It made it a fantastic movie, my emotions were a casualty of it
9/1/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: EXACTLY
9/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: but I wish it had stopped with the montage
9/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Happily ever after is better
9/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Also oh my goodness I love rum
9/1/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: I'm glad!
9/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: And yeah
9/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: That eye contact was absolutely painful
9/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: But so, so beautiful
9/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: How's your night going?
9/1/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Also, we should watch that together sometime even though we've both seen it
9/1/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: I feel like that's one if the few, few movies I could watch again
9/1/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: And again
9/1/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: And again
9/1/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Also speaking of movies with J.K. Simmons chewing jazz musicians out, we should watch Whiplash sometime
9/1/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Okay my eyes are getting heavy so I think I'm going to go to bed, but good night I hope you're having fun! Send me any updates and I'll read them in the morning!
9/2/19, 12:37 AM - Marianna: We have made it to three places
9/2/19, 12:37 AM - Marianna: Helped some pretty drunk university of Richmond students find a club
9/2/19, 12:37 AM - Marianna: They were nice though
9/2/19, 12:37 AM - Marianna: And I would be down to watch it again
9/2/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: But I WILL sing
9/2/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: And I have not seen whiplash so I could also do that
9/2/19, 12:53 AM - Marianna: Oh the Richmond students were both Philly fans!!
9/2/19, 2:00 AM - Marianna: Hi I‚Äôm drunk nice to meet you

9/2/19, 2:55 AM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm not asleep I‚Äôm eating a cookie in bed
9/2/19, 3:03 AM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôve got chips
9/2/19, 3:03 AM - Marianna: They‚Äôre cheese cheeps
9/2/19, 8:27 AM - Caleb: Hello! Good morning!
9/2/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: Glad you had a fun night with Robin, but oh man you're gonna be dog tired aren't ya
9/2/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: Hi nice to meet you drunk, I'm in bed
9/2/19, 8:30 AM - Caleb: Eh, yeah I'm not too sure how to feel on this, probably leaning on the lucky side because of how it's turning out for me? But anyway, have you tried not being such a catch? I think that might be part of your problem here
9/2/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: Wow I'm making so many new friends tonight
9/2/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: And I hope that cookie/the cheeps were good, bed snacks are best snacks
9/2/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: Update: oh my goodness there's the cutest baby on the metro right now he keeps looking at me with these big eyes and laughing
9/2/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: Im gonna die its too cute
9/2/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: And I am awake!
9/2/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: Yeah but it‚Äôs not the best to wake up with cheep crumbs all over the bed
9/2/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: No fun sir
9/2/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: No fun
9/2/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Yeah, yeah that's always a downside
9/2/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: How are you feeling?
9/2/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Ti
9/2/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Red
9/2/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: But other than that not too bad
9/2/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt particularly like staying out that late though
9/2/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: Yeah I can imagine
9/2/19, 11:18 AM - Marianna: I also have even less of a voice than I did yesterday
9/2/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: I was surprised enough that you were clubbing on a Sunday night, and when you said you were back at your place I was like "ah turning in early I see"
9/2/19, 11:19 AM - Marianna: Ha
9/2/19, 11:19 AM - Marianna: Nope
9/2/19, 11:19 AM - Marianna: We lasted a surprisingly long time out
9/2/19, 11:19 AM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm not gonna do it again ever
9/2/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Oh really?
9/2/19, 11:19 AM - Marianna: It was all pretty dead and I will have actual homework and classes
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Yeaaaah
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Yeeeeaaaaaahhh
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Although by 1, the dance place was filling up but not as bad as last weekend
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: I think La La Land was the right choice for a night here
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Yes
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: You are right
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Wait for real? Locals or tourists?
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Smarter than me
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Mostly tourists
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: We met so many Americans
9/2/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: They heard us speaking and they were all like WOAH ARE YOU AMERICAN
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: I guess that's expected for a Sunday night club
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: It's full of people on holiday
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Yeah tourists don‚Äôt have Monday obligations
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Today‚Äôs Labor Day
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt realize that
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Yeeeeeeep, unlike someone
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs not a thing here!
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: üôÉ
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Yeah! Doesn't mean Davidson has off though
9/2/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: So oooohhhhhhhh well
9/2/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: That's still incredibly annoying to me, like why do they do they
9/2/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: They should give their entire staff a day off, it's not just about us
9/2/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: I kind of don‚Äôt mind have classes on it
9/2/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: I see about the staff though
9/2/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: Have you ever gotten to know your building services people? Like, the people that clean the halls and whatnot?
9/2/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: A little
9/2/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I chatted with the lady in Belk whenever she came through
9/2/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Our hall made her cards for her birthday
9/2/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: And not so much for the lady in new dorm
9/2/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: CAROLYN!
9/2/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: I love Carolyn
9/2/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Her and Addison were amazing, at the end of the year, first Belk got the entire building to pool money for her and give them gift cards as a thank you
9/2/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: They do so much for us, it's incredible
9/2/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember her name
9/2/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: But wow that‚Äôs incredible you guys did that
9/2/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Yeah
9/2/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Not gonna lie
9/2/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I mean they definitely deserve it
9/2/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Our places are livable because of them
9/2/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Wait
9/2/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: My hall was so dumb and filthy, and it was after the second time someone pooped on the bathroom floor that Sam and I were like "we're getting our floor to buy them something"
9/2/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: And then we just got the rest of Belk to chip in
9/2/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Please tell me they didn‚Äôt need to clean up the shit on your hall
9/2/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: The first time, no since it was a weekend
9/2/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: ...who did
9/2/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Well, presumably the person who pooped on the floor
9/2/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Sam and I sent scathing messages to our group, and it was cleaned up like an hour later
9/2/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Then an on call guy came and sanitized the spot
9/2/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: What the heck was up with your hall
9/2/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/2/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: ... I really, really wish I had an answer for you
9/2/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: I think first Belk is cursed
9/2/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre your guys worse than base belk this year?
9/2/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: It's 1) wild and not sub free, 2) has all the most outgoing, wild people on it, and 3) is high foot traffic, so a lot of non residents come through on weekends
9/2/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Base Belk was worse, but like personality wise
9/2/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: First Belk was a train wreck behavior wise for the first half, then we either got them in line, or they tired themselves out
9/2/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Oh good to know
9/2/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad that the base belk stereotype lives on
9/2/19, 12:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm amazed that it continues through the years
9/2/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah, base Belk will forever be a toxic place
9/2/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: I swear it's something in the ceiling tiles
9/2/19, 12:11 PM - Marianna: I mean they do literally live like underground
9/2/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: I've gotten asked "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SMOOTH SKIN" before because I didn't live there
9/2/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: Scary place
9/2/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: This year it was less wholesome honestly
9/2/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: It wasn't the fun, wild, untamed base Belk that I loved last year
9/2/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: It was just a lot of douchey kids who thought they were hot shit, and very rude
9/2/19, 12:14 PM - Marianna: Doucheyer than our year?!?!
9/2/19, 12:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad joey didn‚Äôt end up down there
9/2/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah it was infinitely worse
9/2/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: We did a joint program with them once and it was shocking
9/2/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Like, we gave them free pizza and they acted like annoyed middle schoolers who were too cool to be doing anything with hall counselors
9/2/19, 12:20 PM - Marianna: What
9/2/19, 12:20 PM - Marianna: That is so rude
9/2/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: The only joint social we did was with the fourth watts
9/2/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah I had to put up with quite some garbage last year
9/2/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: They basically asked our hall out to an ice cream social
9/2/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: Like I said though, there are some golden, shining moments that made it all worth it
9/2/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: ... Oh? Like, collectively asked you out?
9/2/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Ballsy, I'll give it to them
9/2/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: We had an ice cream social with the girls' side of the hall in like the second week
9/2/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre hall counselors told them they could ask any girls hall and they picked us
9/2/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: We were a fun hall
9/2/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: It was mostly them, but the four guys that did show up got lots of attention so they enjoyed it quite a bit haha
9/2/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs about how ours went
9/2/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: OoooOOOOOOOooOooo fourth watts has a crush on yoooooooouuuuu
9/2/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: üòçüòç
9/2/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah guys halls are kinda lame though, super low turnout
9/2/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: That's why I was hoping for a mixed gender hall when I applied, people just behave a lot better, and are way nicer, and it's just a better time in general
9/2/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: But! You did avoid having to deal with hallcest
9/2/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh yesss, hallcest
9/2/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: Less drama is definitely a payoff
9/2/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: Third rich hallcounselors were kind of like we don‚Äôt want to know anything you all figure it out
9/2/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: Fourth rich had loads of drama issues
9/2/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah, but those are a solid "not my problem" as a hall counselor
9/2/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Like, I'd be happy to be there as a resource and friend, but in the end it's not my responsibility to _have_ to deal with it
9/2/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Things like poop on the floor, having to call campo twice, dealing with weed kids, and having a resident piss on my chairs? That IS my responsibility
9/2/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: So yeah, I'll take the drama and issues over that any day
9/2/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: Hopefully I have neither though
9/2/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/2/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: Maybe sophomores are more mellow
9/2/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: Or whoever lives in little
9/2/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Well, I'ma keep my mouth shut until I get there, because I really really don't want to jinx anything
9/2/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: Im also still not totally sure how RLO is going to feel about me coming back and proceeding to not do SSLI so I can go on orchestra tour
9/2/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: But oh well, I'll burn that bridge when I come to it
9/2/19, 12:45 PM - Marianna: Uh wrong metaphor?
9/2/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: OH RIGHT
9/2/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: Cross it
9/2/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: That's what I'll do
9/2/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: Right right
9/2/19, 12:45 PM - Marianna: Uh ton of paramedics just came into my building
9/2/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: And well you did it last year?
9/2/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah, but I also had a HC pair and already knew my residents
9/2/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: But hey I'm sure it'll be fine
9/2/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: And that's probably not good. Any commotion? Coffee Shop maybe?
9/2/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: No commotion
9/2/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt even hear the ambulance sirens so I assume it‚Äôs nothing awful
9/2/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: They went into the apartment part of the building
9/2/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: When you say "ton" how many do you mean
9/2/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Like 5
9/2/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: So not a TONi guess
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: Maaaaaybe they're strippers? It's someone's birthday?
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: A usual squad
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: ha
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: Oh nevermind yeah probably not
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs 1pm on a Monday
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah totally totally, now if you'll excuse me I need to cancel something I ordered for your birthday then
9/2/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: Also random but Audrey got a new fish!!!
9/2/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: A fish! What's its name?
9/2/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
9/2/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: I am totally fine if the only strippers I see in my lifetime are the spe boys my big sent me during big little
9/2/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: And Toni!
9/2/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Continuing the literary reference pattern
9/2/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: Toni? As in Toni Morrison?
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: You betcha
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: VERY nice
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: I approve
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Not that I really need to
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Live your life Audrey
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: I told her to keep him alive until I got back
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Well see if that happens
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: :(
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Her track record and all
9/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Is he the only fish?
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: She should get him a friend
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Although we maintain we didn‚Äôt kill Atwood
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs a beta
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: So NOOOO
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: Nevermind them
9/2/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: Also idk, Atwood's murder sounds _FISHY_ to me
9/2/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: ... yeah that might have been too soon
9/2/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: I apologize if it was
9/2/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: But that's cool! I'm glad you have a new fish, and I hope to meet him soon
9/2/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: If anything, petsmaet murdered Atwood
9/2/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: He already had fin rot when we got him!
9/2/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: The timeline is off!
9/2/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: Well I guess I don‚Äôt have a new fish :(
9/2/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: But maybe I‚Äôll get visitation rights
9/2/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: Oh this is getting complicated, I forgot about that
9/2/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: I'm sure you will.
9/2/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: You'll be Toni's godmother or something
9/2/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: If you could get an unorthodox pet, all maintenance and care aside, what would you get?
9/2/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Oh maybe I can FaceTime him
9/2/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: And RABBIT
9/2/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: BUNNY
9/2/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: FLOPPY GUY
9/2/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: EARS
9/2/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: SOFT
9/2/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Wait what
9/2/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: I said unorthodox, not completely feasible!
9/2/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: GET A BUNNY!
9/2/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: DO IT
9/2/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: okay but it‚Äôs unfeasible for me
9/2/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: üëèCONTRABANDüëèBUNNYüëè
9/2/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/2/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: But if Todd sigler asks me about it
9/2/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: I'll harbor Buns for you
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna use this conversation as evidence that rlo encouraged contraband bunny
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: His name would be contraband bunny
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Connie for short
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: CONNIE
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: I LOVE IT
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: I totally see you and a bunny being best friends
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Okay got to go to class see ya later
9/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Very compatible personality wise
9/2/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah I've got class too actually, see ya
9/2/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd like a bunny
9/2/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôd need an affectionate one
9/2/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: Like I hope Connie likes cuddling
9/2/19, 2:48 PM - Marianna: He for sure is gonna sleep in my bed
9/2/19, 2:48 PM - Marianna: Although idk if that‚Äôs safe
9/2/19, 2:48 PM - Marianna: I toss and turn a lot and don‚Äôt want to fling him across the room or squish him
9/2/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: Pls don't squish Connie
9/2/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: Only loving squishes
9/2/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Nose squishes
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Caleb: Cheek squishes
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: Boops you might say
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: Oh now I want a BUNNY
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Caleb: Okay I've definitely told you about Bonnie the Bunny, haven't I?
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Caleb: My favorite stuffed animal besides huck
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: no!
9/2/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: Tell me about it!
9/2/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: WELL
9/2/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Bonnie was my first stuffed animal
9/2/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: And it was my mom's first stuffed animal
9/2/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: She got it from her dad, who found her in a trash can with her head ripped off out of anger
9/2/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: And so her dad (who's this war vet and hard-core farmer) pulls it out, cleans it up, and my grandma stitches it up, puts a bow on it, and names it Bonnie
9/2/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: And then when I was super super little, my mom gave it to me
9/2/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: AWWWW THATS SO CURE
9/2/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: CUTE
9/2/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: my grandfather had a bunny that was in my cousins wedding as something borrowed and then he gave it to that cousins first son afterwards when he was born
9/2/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Wait wait are we talking like a real bunny
9/2/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Or stuffed
9/2/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Either way that's precious
9/2/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Also, for a while I was ABSOLUTELY inseparable from Bonnie
9/2/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: I'd always carry her around the house with me, and it's hilarious because when I was going that, she was pretty much as big as me lol
9/2/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: No
9/2/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: Stuffed bunny
9/2/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: I would bring piglet with me EVERYWHERE
9/2/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: He still sometimes comes in the car with me when I run errands
9/2/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: We just went to ikea
9/2/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: Ooooooo what's the Ikea haul? Get anything fun?
9/2/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: Cocktail shaker!
9/2/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: French press!
9/2/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: A few other kitchen things
9/2/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: But the cocktail shaker has recipes on the side of the bottle so I‚Äôm pumped
9/2/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: You think you'll be hosting stuff in your apartment a lot? Sound like you've got the PERFECT setup now
9/2/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know
9/2/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt mind
9/2/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: But Sarah doesn‚Äôt like that as much
9/2/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: And she‚Äôs said so
9/2/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: So I need to respect that this is her space too
9/2/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: So we‚Äôll see
9/2/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Oh totally
9/2/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: I'm sure you'll have plenty of other options for hosting
9/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: But robin and Hans have already kind of invited themselves over for next Friday night...
9/2/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Well if it's just those two it should be fine, right?
9/2/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Does Sarah not want people in general over, or is she more talking about throwing Senior Apartment-style parties?
9/2/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the kind of parties or people over shes I ay with
9/2/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Like when we made fettuccine last semester, it was originally gonna be me, her, and owen and I asked if I could just invite the rest of the group and she was like sure but when a lot of people showed up, she got flustered and ended up not even staying and eating with us
9/2/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: So I don‚Äôt want her to feel like that in her own apartment
9/2/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Is she not an extroverted person?
9/2/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Also, that's incredibly kind of you to be that considerate of her
9/2/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: No she‚Äôs a hyper introvert
9/2/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: I've definitely had a people that would never have done that for me
9/2/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: How does your dynamic work out like that?
9/2/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt entirely know
9/2/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: It just does
9/2/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: She can act extroverted in small groups with her close friends
9/2/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: So like she much prefers hanging out with a very small group of really close friends
9/2/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Where as I would rather have a giant group and be able to be friends with everyone but not need them to be all my BEST friends
9/2/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: I just roundhouse kicked a flying bug out of the air in my apartment
9/2/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: ... You just what now
9/2/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Not bad, not bad at all
9/2/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: On your way to being Master Myagi
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Roundhouse
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: KICKED
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: a FLYING bug
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Our of the AIR
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: The bugs behoozie yeah yeah I follow now
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: yup
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm super cool
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: You did karate, right?
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: üëàüëà
9/2/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah haha
9/2/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: That's right that's right
9/2/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Then it should have been a jump 540 roundhouse
9/2/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: I expected more from you Marianna
9/2/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Hit 'em with the crescent kick
9/2/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: Anyway, my nights been much less exciting
9/2/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: I kinda just got back from class, hit the bed, and napped
9/2/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: My favorite were always flying scissor kicks or hook kicks
9/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Oh, jump crescent into roundhouse was always mine
9/2/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: How has your day been?
9/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: We used to do demonstrations and one time I did one off of someone's back to break boards
9/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Highlight of my life
9/2/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And it's been okay, I got elected as a class rep which was pretty fun I guess
9/2/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And then my second class was pretty decent
9/2/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And I got some cheap schwarma in between
9/2/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And then thicc nap
9/2/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And that's been it
9/2/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: What about you?
9/2/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Whoa that sounds super cool and also super dangerous
9/2/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Glad no one died
9/2/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: And class rep?
9/2/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: I had 3 hours of class, then ikea, then a snack and now I‚Äôm rushing off to yoga!
9/2/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Also it got cold!
9/2/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Yay cold!
9/2/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: And by cold I mean 74 degrees
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: And yeah, basically class rep just means that I'm the liason between the class and one of my professors
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna wear pants tomorrow!
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Heyyy that's the move
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs so cool
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Congrats!
9/2/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Thanks! It basically just means I get to get coffee with a professor like once a month
9/2/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Also, it's been _pure_ sweater weather today
9/2/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: It's wonderful
9/2/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Hey if I know anything about Caleb Grenko it‚Äôs that he‚Äôd love to be given the task of getting coffee with his professor once a month
9/2/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah honestly I‚Äôm regretting wearing shorts to yoga a little bit
9/2/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: But usually it‚Äôs my g warner rn
9/2/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Much**
9/2/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: But yeah, other than that it's pretty much been just listening to people book flights and it's getting annoying at this point
9/2/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Hey! Cozy weather around the corner, have fun at yoga
9/2/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Are you heading there now?
9/2/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Why is it annoying?
9/2/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: And yeah on the metro now
9/2/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Metro is v warm though
9/2/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm only a little worried I‚Äôm gonna freeze in my apartment
9/2/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Because I have no blankets
9/2/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: But I can always go back to Ikea to get one I guess
9/2/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Because I've made exactly no plans and it seems like all my friends are grouping up and making travel plans for breaks, and at the moment I don't really have anything planned so it's just a little stressful
9/2/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: And noo! Pick up some fluffy blankets
9/2/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Get cozy
9/2/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm sorry
9/2/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: No no it's fine
9/2/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: It'll all fall into place soon
9/2/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Still doesn‚Äôt feel good to feel left out
9/2/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: Yeah, yeah it doesn't
9/2/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Can you not hop in on any of their plans?
9/2/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Well, most of their plans are over the break when I was gonna visit you, so it's like a half overlap
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: So like I'm fine for the second part of the week, but I'm not sure what I'll do for the first half
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm sorry to be a problem!
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: I was thinking of just flying to Prague and exploring on my own
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm also stressed to figure out my fall break plans
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha you're the opposite of a problem.
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: And all other plans
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Well thank you I suppose
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: Or if you are, you're a good one to have
9/2/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: But still I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs tricky for you to coordinate
9/2/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: But yeah it's just frustrating because I feel behind the curve, and like my hands are tied until I fill in more unknowns
9/2/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt you talk about wanting to do croatia in connection with Budapest?
9/2/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I did, but I'll need to find people to go with me
9/2/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: And planning half a trip with people is also part of the issue then
9/2/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Hey they can come to Budapest too!
9/2/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a pretty cool place
9/2/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt promise to house them or show them around but idk
9/2/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: I feel like budapest is looked over
9/2/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Yeah! Totally true, but also I think everyone has their plans already
9/2/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Ooooh I see I see
9/2/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah, and then on top of all this I'm running into visa issues so I can't book any China stuff
9/2/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Which I guess is the root of a lot of my stress tbh
9/2/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Visa issues?
9/2/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Do you need a Visa to get to China?
9/2/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Or troubles with your Copenhagen one on the return?
9/2/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: Chinese visa
9/2/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: It's pretty complicated to apply as a US citizen in a foreign country, because I need to be in person at an embassy with documents that I'm here legally
9/2/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: And I'm not gonna have these documents until about two weeks from the conference
9/2/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: So nothing is actually confirmed, and I'm forced to have a deadline that's insanely tight
9/2/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Despite it being months away
9/2/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Oh woah that‚Äôs absolutely insane
9/2/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Nothing like not knowing the details of a pretty big deal trip to China for UPenn while you‚Äôre having to deal with school stress as well
9/2/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Also I have no idea where but I‚Äôm gonna be sore as HECK tomorrow
9/2/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah, and I'm currently sitting in the library doing a ton of reading I neglected
9/2/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: Mostly because it wasn't assigned until like yesterday
9/2/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: I feel like this semester is going to be less of a cakewalk than I thought
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Oh! And speaking of the library, it's actually the library of the Copenhagen School of Business, which is SUPER cool and worth sneaking (read: walking) into
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: And hey! That's the good type of sore that I love
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Yesterday was Sunday?
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Yes, yes it was
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: They assigned reading on Sunday?
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: And you betcha I got an email
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Also Sarah‚Äôs flight is delayed :(
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs trashy
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Well its for a class on Tuesday
9/2/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Can you send pictures of the library?
9/2/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: Or are you too swarmed with reading?  I don‚Äôt want to make you get up
9/2/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: OH I AM BLOWN AWAY
9/2/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: THATS MORE THAN I EXPECTED
9/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: There's a giant really cool art piece hanging in the middle of the room, but it mostly plays with space so it doesn't show up well on camera
9/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: That photo hurts my brain
9/2/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Not you!
9/2/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Just the weird distortion
9/2/19, 9:53 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think it's double paned glass
9/2/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Get that sweet sweet thermal insulation
9/2/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm really sorry about Sarah's fligjt
9/2/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Flight *
9/2/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: I know how much you were looking forward to finally having her there :(
9/2/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: And also the day you've been planning, but I'm sure she'll take a raincheck on it!
9/2/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs unlike any library I‚Äôve ever seen
9/2/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Well she might just get here after noon if she doesn‚Äôt make the original plane
9/2/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: But I wouldn‚Äôt be able to meet her at the airport
9/2/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: But it has to be crazy stressful for her
9/2/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Marietta by Upstate
https://open.spotify.com/track/6eOc29YX6IoRO2gwPoUjAs?si=syfuuz-xQPykWr8ykl-ELA
9/2/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Oh holy shit Marianna
9/2/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: I think I might be trapped in here
9/2/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: I tried to open a door but it was locked
9/2/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Then I found an automatic sliding door, walked DIRECTLY up to it, and nothing happened
9/2/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: At least if I die here it'll be a cool place
9/2/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: NEVERMIND, FREEDOM!
9/2/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: And yeah, flying is always, *always* a crazy, stressful experience
9/2/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: But just imagine how relieved she's going to be when she sees you
9/2/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: That'll make it all worth it
9/2/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Wow these Scandinavians sure do love their architecture
9/2/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Hi I can come up with a lot of places worst to be stuck than a library
9/2/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs a pretty picture
9/2/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: Are you just walking around now?
9/2/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: I was for a bit, but then it got too cold and I rode my bike back
9/2/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: So now I'm in my room again
9/2/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Me too
9/2/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Although Sarah and I may do that as part of our fall break
9/2/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: When's your fall break?
9/2/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Oct 25-nov 3
9/2/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah I was hoping to go at some point too
9/2/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: But there's certainly enough to do in the Netherlands to last more than one weekend
9/2/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: And everything is a quick train ride away from Amsterdam
9/2/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: But then again, that's not totally the crowd that I think I'd want to hang with in Amsterdam
9/2/19, 10:46 PM - Caleb: Oh nevermind they've got Ben Heuser it looks like it's a golden trip after all
9/2/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/2/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: This is what happens when I plan things :(
9/2/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Lol it‚Äôs mostly my friends
9/2/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: But yeah I feel like it‚Äôs a quick hop for you
9/2/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Hey maybe it's a blessing for her, maybe the grandma's have SUPER cool lives and getting to know them will give her a new outlook on life or something
9/2/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah
9/2/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: ALSO
9/2/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: I need advice on Italy
9/2/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: You had a Wednesday-sunday off, and wanted to go to Italy with friends, how many cities would you visit, and which ones
9/2/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: 2, maybe 3 if you count a day trip around another city
9/2/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: I think Florence for sure
9/2/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: And you could day trip to Tuscany (there are wine tours or bike tours or other things that go out there. We did a bike tour but I don‚Äôt know the details but it was so awesome)
9/2/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm impartial to Venice
9/2/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: Those two are also two of the easiest to get to
9/2/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: What's your hot take on Rome
9/2/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Hot take on Rome is it ain‚Äôt too hot
9/2/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt like it
9/2/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôm glad I went once
9/2/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: But I never want to go back
9/2/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: But Vatican was cool
9/2/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Since it's only like 5 days, it might be worth it to do Florence, Venice, and Tuscany then
9/2/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Thank you thank you, very helpful
9/2/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Or I might just do 2 cities and get a deeper feeling on them
9/2/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm going to go to bed soon, but how was your day?
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Good
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm up with Sarah
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: And bombarding her with airport pubs
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: I found one I think you‚Äôll like:
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Me in airport: what do we want??
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: People: AIRPLANE NOISES!!!
9/2/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Me: and when do we want them??
9/2/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: People: NYYYOW
9/2/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Oh that's pure gold
9/2/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Sorry I've been slacking on the pun game lately
9/2/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: I can totally hear you doing that though
9/2/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Here's a good one
9/2/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: A passenger is panicking on an airplane, so he runs up to the cockpit and sees a little green man flying the plane
9/2/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: The passenger shrugs it off, and goes "pilot! Are we going the right way?"
9/2/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: And Yoda replies, "off course, we are"
9/2/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Oh and another one while I'm at it: what sound does an airplane make when it bounces?
9/2/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know what sound does it make
9/2/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Boeing! Boeing! Boeing!
9/2/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: HA
9/2/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Sarah‚Äôs getting that one
9/2/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Wonderful
9/2/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: I think I might have to call it a night soon too
9/2/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Well, give Sarah my best wishes for getting across the pond, I'm going to sleep because I have my first class at 8:30
9/2/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Okay then, goodnight!
9/2/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Oh yes sleep sleep sleepy caleb
9/2/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Goodnight
9/2/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Oh also how‚Äôs your discover weekly this week?  I used last weeks from you as my going to sleep playlist but now it‚Äôs gone so I‚Äôm curious if Spotify continues the vibe for you
9/2/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: I honestly haven't checked it out yet, but I'll be sure to give it a listen and let you know
9/2/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: I saved most of the songs so I can send them to you, or if you need a new link I can do that too
9/2/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Night!
9/3/19, 7:20 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre in room -1?
9/3/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: How does that work?
9/3/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Oh I have to walk backwards through the door every time
9/3/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: It's kinda awkward but I'm in the wrong room otherwise
9/3/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: üôÑ
9/3/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Anyway good morning
9/3/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôve probably been up for a while because you have your early class today right?
9/3/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: üòÅ
9/3/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: Good morning
9/3/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: And yeah, I had my first Neural Networks class
9/3/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Well I just got up and flight aware says Sarah is over the Atlantic Ocean
9/3/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: It's fun, he's a really really cool guy but also I don't know how he'll be as a teacher
9/3/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: And HOORAY FOR SARAH
9/3/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: WOOOHOOO
9/3/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: Did you not get a sense of how he‚Äôll be as a teacher today?
9/3/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: (oh and also I think the 1, -1 is just how they write like a semicolon, I'm not sure why)
9/3/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: He just earned cool guy status?
9/3/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: WHAT
9/3/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: No no, it's the first class though
9/3/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: DNEMARK
9/3/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: WHAT ARE YOU ON
9/3/19, 10:36 AM - Marianna: Oh my gosh it is so chill outside
9/3/19, 10:36 AM - Marianna: It feels glorious
9/3/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: Update: the guy at the Schwarma place gave me his private number so I can text him orders ahead of time
9/3/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: I'M IN
9/3/19, 11:45 AM - Marianna: Oh you are sooooo set for the semester
9/3/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 11:48 AM - Caleb: Cool dude cool dude
9/3/19, 11:48 AM - Caleb: Anyways, how's your day been? What are you up to?
9/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve just been eating in my apartment
9/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Class is in an hour
9/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: So not much
9/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: What about you?
9/3/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Well
9/3/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: I've had two classes
9/3/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Am very tired, and have one more
9/3/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Oh the tired just hit me again
9/3/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Man we've run the absolute gauntlet of topics with Ahmed
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: But I need to do 3 hours of classes!
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: This has been a very interesting much
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: When do they start?
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: What
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: lunch*
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: Wait who‚Äôs Ahmed
9/3/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: And 1
9/3/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Aw man so you don't have time for a nap
9/3/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: My man Ahmed works at the Schwarma place
9/3/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: I think it's a one man operation
9/3/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: He's from Palestine, and this place is right in the middle of 3 gay bars
9/3/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: And so he was telling us what incredible people they are and how lucky he is to know them, and how unfairly they're treated around the world
9/3/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Then he started explaining the kinks he's heard about
9/3/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: And then it somehow turned to US politics
9/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: No :(
9/3/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Wish
9/3/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Woah*
9/3/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a whirlwind of topics
9/3/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Cool that you‚Äôre getting to talk with interesting people and hear their stories though
9/3/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah, it's the only affordable food near campus anyway so I think I've found my regular spot
9/3/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Have you ever worked with a lot of immigrants?
9/3/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: I'd imagine not at your last job(s), but maybe at like Williams Sonoma?
9/3/19, 12:14 PM - Marianna: Yeah nope not really
9/3/19, 12:14 PM - Marianna: Williams Sonoma was a bunch of white middle aged women
9/3/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah okay I don't know what I was expecting there
9/3/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: But yeah, it was a really, really rewarding experience when I did, because I met so many interesting people with fascinating life stories and I could really see how their upbringing made them who they are
9/3/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: Also, does that make you a middle aged white woman for working at Willams Sonoma
9/3/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: And it's totally okay because I'm basically an embarrassing dad at this point with my hall and the dad jokes
9/3/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: No
9/3/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm too #hip #cool for that
9/3/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: That's JUST what a middle aged mom would say
9/3/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: ...exactly
9/3/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Are you trying to embarrass your kid right now?
9/3/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: But I actually don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm toooo wine mom yet
9/3/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Nah you're at completely acceptable levels of wine mom
9/3/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: I think we might be kinda close in the wine-mom-ness actually
9/3/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: I feel too young to be even a wine mom
9/3/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: #Ros√©AllDay
9/3/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got too much spunk and lets go out attitude in me
9/3/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: #LiveLaughLove
9/3/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Oh goodness who are you kidding you are definitely worse than I am
9/3/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Also
9/3/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm wearing more clothing than I have in months and it feels amazing because I‚Äôm still a little chilly for my walk to class
9/3/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: I was about to refute that
9/3/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: But then I stepped in another Danish homegoods store and bombarded you with snapchat, so maybe you're right
9/3/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Also THATS AMAZING
9/3/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: This is such an exciting time of the year
9/3/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: It's like thank God the heat is over
9/3/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Break out fun fall clothes
9/3/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: And you get to layer like an onion
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: EXACTLY Caleb
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre much much worse
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: LIES
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Although I had fun in Ike‚Äôs
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Ikea
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: And yeah
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Malarkey!
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Inside buildings is still hot though
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt like that
9/3/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Yea hence the layering
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Also found some very smushed tootsie rolls in my coat project
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Pocket
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know the last time I wore it or when the tootsie rolls are from
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Uhhhh you gonna eat that?
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: They are in the trash now
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Noooo
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Wasted
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: ...
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: How could you
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: SMUSHED
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: TASTY
9/3/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Like sticking to the lining of the pocket smushed
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Oh, oh no
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: üò≥
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Nevermind
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Yup you see
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: I'm backing out of this one
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: I was right
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Sarah‚Äôs in London!
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Uh yeah congrats
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: ‚≠ê
9/3/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: There's your gold star for being right
9/3/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: And woah that's awesome! How's her layover looking?
9/3/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: Oh wait don‚Äôt I get something if I get enough gold stars
9/3/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: She leaves in like an hour I think
9/3/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: So not toooo long
9/3/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: But she also left her house like 24 hours ago
9/3/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think you were gonna get something, it was probably cheesy
9/3/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: However, all my texts are deleted so I'll let you make up your own prize
9/3/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: And uuuuugh that's such a long travel day, I hope she's not too wiped
9/3/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: I hope she stayed up though so she gets over the jetlag quickly
9/3/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: Because as not fun as it is to not sleep in planes, it's even less fun not being able to function for like a week
9/3/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Okay, back from class and you already know what time it is
9/3/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: T h i c c N a p
9/3/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: Haha I have a great power now
9/3/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll come up with a great prize you owe me
9/3/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: I mean we have orientation all day Friday/ Saturday/ Sunday so she doesn‚Äôt have a ton of time to adjust
9/3/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: Done my classes!
9/3/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: I need to try to find Marsala wine
9/3/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: Sarah wanted chicken Marsala
9/3/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: I hope you are so enjoying that thiccccc nap though
9/3/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: Also nap in Hungarian means day
9/3/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Haaa, sure things, just let me know when you decide, consider this an IOU üòÅ
9/3/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: And hey! Congrats! You're done done, right? As in until orientation?
9/3/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: So OHHHHHHHH man I love chicken marsala
9/3/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Definitely one of my favorite dishes
9/3/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: It's hard to find the right spices here though, you need to go to specialty stores
9/3/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Well okay not DONE done
9/3/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Just for the day
9/3/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Our teacher says we have a final test tomorrow
9/3/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs kidding or not
9/3/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm gonna make a quizlet tonight with everything and just dothag a bit
9/3/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Do that**
9/3/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think Sarah will mind considering she‚Äôll probably just want to sleep anyway
9/3/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Yeah I don‚Äôt think Marsala wine is a thing here :(
9/3/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: Oh hey mr soon to be 21 year old. I‚Äôll cook chicken Marsala for you if you can get the wine in the us when we get back to campus
9/3/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: Because now I really want it
9/3/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs such a comforting food
9/3/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: Oh hey Ms. Correct, I'll help you under one condition
9/3/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: I get to help cook üòä
9/3/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: And ooooooo that's stressful
9/3/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: I mean, it definitely won't hurt to do quizlet, even if it isn't tested
9/3/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Also, you don't get a grade for this, so ehhhhhhh what are they gonna do to you
9/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Yeah but also why would they test us
9/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: I guess testing is a method and madness of learning
9/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: But yes of course you can help cook
9/3/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: If you like mushrooms I‚Äôll even include them (when I cook it for myself, I just keep them out)
9/3/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Ahaha I won't force that on you, no worries
9/3/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: But if it is a test, it'll be a no-consequences test except for your own good
9/3/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: So do yourself a favor and don't stress out too much
9/3/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Well now I‚Äôm stressing myself out because I couldn‚Äôt figure out which side of the street I needed to be on to get on the bus to get to the airport
9/3/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm going to wrong way rn because of that
9/3/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs only 2 stops and I assume it will turn around and go back to the airport
9/3/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: I ASSUME
9/3/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: Oh jk
9/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: I need a special ticket for the airport shuttle
9/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs dumb
9/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: And rn idk if I‚Äôll make it in time to see her so I‚Äôm just gonna wait at the apartment
9/3/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I think that's a good call
9/3/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: How long until she gets there?
9/3/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: She lands in about 30 min
9/3/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: Oh man
9/3/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: E X C I T I N G
9/3/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Hi pup
9/3/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: I don't think I have a picture on my phone that will show how excited I am for you, but here's a picture of Parker instead
9/3/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/3/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I was like OH DID YOU TAKE PARKER WITH YOUUUUUU
9/3/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: Oh LORD I wish
9/3/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: Aw man now I miss Charlie and Parker
9/3/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: IT'S FINE
9/3/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Aw I‚Äôm sorry
9/3/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt mean to bring it up
9/3/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Did you bring your stuffed pup?
9/3/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: (I forget his name and I am so sorry)
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: His name is Huckleberry
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: And no, I didn't :(
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: He'll be at home waiting for me though
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: Aw
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: Yes I thought it started with an h
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: Which of your stuffed friends are in Budapest?
9/3/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: Sarah has a stuffed Dalmatian who‚Äôs name also starts with an h
9/3/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: Just pig :(
9/3/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: I miss the others
9/3/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: But they would have been a lot to travel
9/3/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: I'm sure they miss you too
9/3/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: But just do what I do when I miss the rest of my friends-- think about how great it'll be when you see them next!
9/3/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm grocery shopping right now, you got anything you think I should make in the next week
9/3/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Yeah I miss my comfies
9/3/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: And ah I don‚Äôt know
9/3/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: I can hardly meal plan for my own week
9/3/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I generate a random number and just bring it up
9/3/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Sorry just being the recipe doc up and do that number recipe
9/3/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Oh I totally did that
9/3/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: And then decided it was taco night for the next two nights
9/3/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: But hey I'm out of there now anyway
9/3/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Also I have a new plant! His name is Charley
9/3/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: And he's a Chives plant
9/3/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: YOU REPLACED YOUR DOG
9/3/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: No no
9/3/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: His full name is Charley Chives
9/3/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: And my dog is Charlie
9/3/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: WAY different
9/3/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Geez don't say things like that üò¢
9/3/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Also that comic makes me so happy
9/3/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: SORRY
9/3/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: okay different spelling
9/3/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: DID I tell you that I saw a rosemary plant at the store
9/3/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt get it because I was like I don‚Äôt have a plantar!
9/3/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: But I do!
9/3/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: There were old cactuses in it
9/3/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: So I think I‚Äôm gonna get it
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: You gonna ditch the old cacti?
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Cruel
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: They dead boy
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: But worth it
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: They DEAD
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Give them a funeral!
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Trashcan
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Trashcan
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: I BET THEY HAD NAMES MARIANNA
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Trashcan
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: HOW COULD YOU
9/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Trashcan
9/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Trashcan
9/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Trashcan
9/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Sure
9/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Why not
9/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Maybe that's how I'd want to go
9/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: The true millennial way
9/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: "yeah after I kick the bucket just yeet me into a trashcan"
9/3/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: How else would you get rid of done plants
9/3/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Also
9/3/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: SARAHS HERE
9/3/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: YAYYAYAYAYAYAY
9/3/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: You guys doing anything tonight, or is she just going to crash?
9/3/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: We just ate
9/3/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Leftovers
9/3/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: I love that for you
9/3/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Nothing too special
9/3/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: Any other plans?
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: We did finish the white wine
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Am I speaking with Drunk Marianna?
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Now I have a test to study for
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: :)
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: No no
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Oh, oh goodness
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: There wasn‚Äôt THAT much wine left
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Tipsy
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: I'm guessing Sarah put the face down?
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: But not drunk
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Hey tipsy is fun
9/3/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Nah she‚Äôs surprisingly still up
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Tipsy is perfect
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: She says she doesn‚Äôt feel tired
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Woah, yeah that's pretty impressive
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Got a song for you
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Blue hundreds by holy mattress money
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I think she‚Äôs gonna crash
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs probably good she‚Äôs not asleep yet
9/3/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Maybe she‚Äôll adjust better
9/3/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/3/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: And also it's earlier for her, not later, isn't it?
9/3/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: Each
9/3/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/3/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs been up for like 24 hours with v little sleep on plane
9/3/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: Yeah that'll do unkind things to people
9/3/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: So! How was your day?
9/3/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Pretty good
9/3/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Could not find Marsala
9/3/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Happy to have Sarah
9/3/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Felt like it flew by
9/3/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Probably should have been reviewing vocab before when I was watching gossip girl
9/3/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: How Twas your day!
9/3/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Hey sounds like a good day to me
9/3/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I had 3 classes, was very sleepy by the last one, came home, napped, got groceries, and then came back and did homework
9/3/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: After a while, I want to Tivoli which is this beautiful amusement park in downtown Copenhagen, and we left a bit ago and now we're hanging out at a bar
9/3/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Oh get any pictures from tivoli?
9/3/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: And is that tivoli gardens?
9/3/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Or am I thinking of something else with a similar name
9/3/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: And oh this wine and day has made me very tired
9/3/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt want to review Hungarian
9/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: I didn't bring veev for obvious reasons, but here are some phone shots
9/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: OH SO PRETTY
9/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Looks a little like a fairytale
9/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre there rides?
9/4/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: Very fairy tale
9/4/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: Also you betcha there were rides
9/4/19, 12:22 AM - Caleb: It was odd though because you had to pay for admission and then rides on top of it, so we only did two, then got waffles and walked around for a bit
9/4/19, 12:22 AM - Caleb: Overall a pretty fun night, gotta say
9/4/19, 12:22 AM - Caleb: How are you doing?
9/4/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: Oh it still looks so pretty
9/4/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: That is odd
9/4/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: Almost like a fair though
9/4/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: Good
9/4/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm getting ready for bed
9/4/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: I figured just going through and typing out the quizlet is going to be more than other people in the class do so I‚Äôm probably okay just doing that
9/4/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: Have any fun field trips tomorrow?
9/4/19, 12:39 AM - Caleb: Yeah you're golden
9/4/19, 12:39 AM - Caleb: Super smart, you've got this
9/4/19, 12:39 AM - Caleb: And yeah! I'm going to the national museum tomorrow!
9/4/19, 12:40 AM - Caleb: I'm gonna take Veev because I really regretted not bringing him on the last one
9/4/19, 12:40 AM - Caleb: Right now I'm just waiting for the metro though
9/4/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: Ooooooooh that sounds super cool
9/4/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: With our student passes, we get free admission to the museums here
9/4/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: I want to take advantage of that
9/4/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: And really cheap opera tickets apparently
9/4/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: Although Sarah wasn‚Äôt too enthused when I said I wanted to go to the opera
9/4/19, 12:43 AM - Marianna: And get home safe!  I think I‚Äôm gonna crash so I gotta go!
9/4/19, 12:43 AM - Marianna: Goodnight!
9/4/19, 12:59 AM - Caleb: Well
9/4/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: I just bought a brownie and milk at 7/11, so my night is ending well!
9/4/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: Okay! Finally back, goodnight! I'll talk to you tomorrow
9/4/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: What?! Of that sounds like heaven
9/4/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: One of Sarah‚Äôs questions to me yesterday was where do you go after dinner to get brownies and I was like uhhhhh I don‚Äôt know
9/4/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: I wasn‚Äôt aware that would be asked of me
9/4/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: Great minds man, great minds
9/4/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: No but actually me too
9/4/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd still never throw a book away
9/4/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: No trashcan
9/4/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: But I was angry at it
9/4/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: And didn‚Äôt want it near me
9/4/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: To continue the saga of poor forward I just saw someone wearing crocs. I don‚Äôt know what ukase saw that
9/4/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah, we never actually talked about the books did we? I feel like you've got some choice words for it
9/4/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: And crocs? In Budapest? In the year of our lord 2019? Crikey
9/4/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: I guess they're comfortable
9/4/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: I actually saw a kid wearing GIANT crocks on the metro, like size 13 or something and he was shorter than me
9/4/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: It was comical
9/4/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: No I don‚Äôt think we have
9/4/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: But I also haven‚Äôt read them in YEARS
9/4/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: so I‚Äôm not sure how much I‚Äôd be able to contribute to the convo
9/4/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: But woah that does sound like a sight to see
9/4/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: Marianna I have a very important question
9/4/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: Have you ever owned crocs? And if not, what size shoe do you wear?
9/4/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: TOTALLY just curious hahahaha I would _never_ buy you crocs for your birthday ahahaha ha
9/4/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: Okay actually though, now I'm remembering how I owned Heelys in 2nd grade, and actually how fun they were
9/4/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: Man
9/4/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: Those were the days
9/4/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: I had knock off crocs
9/4/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: And no
9/4/19, 10:27 AM - Marianna: I would disown you
9/4/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Or disavow you
9/4/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Or whatever dis word works here
9/4/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Maybe just dis you
9/4/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Now that I think of it
9/4/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: I never had heelys :( Judy said they were too dangerous
9/4/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: Update test is done
9/4/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: Passed!!
9/4/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: Which is all that matters
9/4/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: I honestly think they might just do it for the stats to see how the teachers do
9/4/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: But we did KILL jeopardy beforehand so the studying kind of mattered
9/4/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: Oh so there WAS a test! Well I'm glad it worked out
9/4/19, 11:51 AM - Caleb: Also too late already ordered ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/4/19, 11:51 AM - Caleb: I even got the bonus pack of the things you stick in the croc holes
9/4/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: And NOOOO Judy! Those were legitimately fun, but yeah I'm surprised I don't have brain trauma from them or something
9/4/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: My mom probably made me wear a helmet
9/4/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Thanks mom
9/4/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Also, grades are temporary, the glory from jeopardy is forever
9/4/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Aren‚Äôt they called giblets or soemthing
9/4/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: After jeopardy, one of the other girls was like I will pay one of you to write my name on your test
9/4/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Her team didn‚Äôt do so hot and ours do sooo
9/4/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: But she was kidding
9/4/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs still to even hear people joking about it though because I feel like at Davidson, people are so in love with the honor code that they wouldn‚Äôt even joke
9/4/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah I can see how that would be jarring
9/4/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Also this museum is incredible
9/4/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: I've been in here for like 3 hours and have only seen about 1/6 of it
9/4/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Fun fact, in Mongolian homes, it was seen as good fortune if a child falls on its face when coming into a home
9/4/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Woah
9/4/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôve got a long day ahead of you boyo
9/4/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: And I love that
9/4/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd be able to bless so many homes
9/4/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

9/4/19, 12:49 PM - Caleb: Those are some highlights
9/4/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: Ooooh looks cool
9/4/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre on a scavenger hunt
9/4/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: On the island between buda and pest
9/4/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: Pretty
9/4/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt bring andi
9/4/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: On purpose because I didn‚Äôt want to hold everyone up
9/4/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Poor Andi :(
9/4/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: I think later today/tonight I might be exploring with a friend for a class
9/4/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: For my History of Copenhagen class, we need to write an essay where we pick four buildings corresponding to these four eras of Danish history, go take pictures of their defining characteristics, then write about them
9/4/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Wait! She goes to Davidson! Do you know Emily Juel?
9/4/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Oh and also! Right now I'm in the Royal Library and it's preeeetty cool, gotta say
9/4/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: It's called the "Black Diamond"
9/4/19, 3:20 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs such a cool project
9/4/19, 3:20 PM - Marianna: And no, I don‚Äôt think I know her
9/4/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: But you mentioned her before I think?
9/4/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: And ooooh pictures?
9/4/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: The only pictures I took of the island is the one on my story and the video I sent you and this one:
9/4/19, 3:22 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Ah, well she lived on second Rich
9/4/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: And sorry, I don't think I actually grabbed any pictures
9/4/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôve definitely seen her before
9/4/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: There were a bunch of VERY explicit "no photography" signs in the room I was in
9/4/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: It's where a lot of locals go to study and work, so the Danish government doesn't want a bunch of tourists swarming it
9/4/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/4/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Yeah that might do it
9/4/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Oh that makes sense
9/4/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like the New York library
9/4/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Lots of tourists
9/4/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Among the people who are doing actual work
9/4/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's unfortunate
9/4/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: There's like _regular_ levels of tourists being obnoxious, then there's that
9/4/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Have you ever heard about how Amish people keep having to kick Chinese tourists out of their houses?
9/4/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: No?  What?
9/4/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/4/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Well
9/4/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Basically, Chinese tourists think Amish people are SUPER interesting, but they don't understand that it's not like a heritage site or living museum-- it's an actual community of people just trying to live
9/4/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: So they figure it's a museum exhibit, and people are actors, so they end up just driving up to Amish communities, breaking into houses, taking pictures, and then some poor Amish person just stumbles across random Chinese tourists in their bedroom or kitchen
9/4/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: What
9/4/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: That is insane
9/4/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: I cannot imagine
9/4/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs rude but also they probably don‚Äôt mean to be rude
9/4/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: But inconsiderate or soemthing
9/4/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm not really sure what it is
9/4/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: They might know and not care, or they might just not know
9/4/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: I don't think I can be the judge of it
9/4/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: So! How was your day?
9/4/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Day was pretty good
9/4/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been pretty tired
9/4/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm so happy Sarah is here
9/4/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: I may shower and nap soon
9/4/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: How was your day?
9/4/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: I'm glad Sarah's there too, it's gonna be SO much more fun
9/4/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: And my day was pretty good
9/4/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: I already gave you a pretty thorough breakdown of it
9/4/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: The only new things are that I made fancy ramen and napped for like an hour
9/4/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: I'm shocked at how much I've been napping honestly, this is like the complete opposite of me at home lol
9/4/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: Fancy ramen????
9/4/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôm proud of you for napping
9/4/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: I did not get a nap today
9/4/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: Also!  So I‚Äôm hoping to get tickets for Copenhagen as soon as I get my class schedule on Sunday. Sarah and I are tentatively looking to come sept 27-29?  Would that work?  Would you still want to do an air B and B for that weekend?  Sarah would probably just stay with Marion if she‚Äôs cool with it (I asked and should get a response in a few business days)
9/4/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Oh shoot I napped so hard that I missed the first orchestra meeting
9/4/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Well guess I'm not doing that this semester, am I
9/4/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: And yeah! That weekend would work
9/4/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: I think I'd still lean towards an AirBnB just because I don't want to put Reid in that awkward position of being kinda unable to say no
9/4/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: And besides we would only need it two nights, so I'm sure it wouldn't be that much
9/4/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: Just let me know when you actually make plans with that
9/4/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Okay AirBnB update, looks like anything that's more than literally just giving you a tent works out to about $200 for the weekend
9/4/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: I'll just talk with Reid tonight
9/4/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: No!  I mean I guess you could just go to the second meeting?
9/4/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Im planning on making the plan as soon as I get my classes
9/4/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: But that means I have to write my proposal for my parents by then
9/4/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: So if you have any bright ideas for what to do while there, that would be helpful so I can show them thats it‚Äôs a cultural/educational trip too
9/4/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: And I found 1 for like 160-170 or something. If we split it that‚Äôs not too bad but I also get if you wouldn‚Äôt want to split it because you have a place and I don‚Äôt so it‚Äôs more of a me issue.
9/4/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: No no I'll totally split it
9/4/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Also sure! I've already got a few things I wanted to do! Want me to just throw them all at you?
9/4/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Also, just send wherever you're thinking for rooms, and I'll 100% split it, just try to get an answer soon so prices don't go up too much
9/4/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Yes please!  I just have to convince them why they should should send me go on these trips as part of my abroad experience so like I may come up with a few things but if you have ideas of what to do, I want to be able to include those so I don‚Äôt write a proposal on my own and then do nothing because you had plans
9/4/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: So like if you have museums of places in mind I guess
9/4/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Sure! I'll just send you a bunch now if you want
9/4/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g806262-d5257023-Reviews-The_Cisterns-Frederiksberg_Copenhagen_Zealand.html
9/4/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: First off, there's this incredible museum/art gallery in the old Cisterns which I REALLY want to go to
9/4/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: It's got the world renowned Tivoli
9/4/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Highly recommended
9/4/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Stunning gardens and thrilling rides
9/4/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Beautiful old churches
9/4/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Every street is packed with history
9/4/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Copenhagen is the seat of absolutely ICONIC Nordic designers
9/4/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Castles: Rosenburg castle, Christiansburg castle, Frederiksberg castle
9/4/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: We have a world renowned planetarium
9/4/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: And we HAVE to go to the Botanical Gardens
9/4/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: We could spend an entire day in the national museum and still learn things about the Nordic lifestyles
9/4/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: From ancient to modern
9/4/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Also, Copenhagen is unique city
9/4/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: It was the "in between" of Europe and Scandinavia for a long long time, and the city sits on the Baltic sound which means that it had massive significance on the global scale
9/4/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Okay thank you v v much
9/4/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: I may also look at rick Steves guide to cope but those all sound like super fun things and we only have about 3 days but we can figure it out we did stellarly in dc
9/4/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: And I may ask one night I get to get Marion and Margaux and we all go to the club
9/4/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: Miss my gals
9/4/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: But I probably won‚Äôt include that in the proposal
9/4/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Want me to send you the Airbnb link so you can look at it?  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs super downtown but one review said there is a bus right outside that goes downtown easily
9/4/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: But again, it‚Äôs up to you and Reid and your flat mates what you are comfy with
9/4/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: And just got back from dinner with Sarah!
9/4/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll never believe what I had
9/4/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: (I would like you to guess)
9/4/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah I felt like DC was a pretty good balance of just hanging out and doing touristy things
9/4/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: And yeah! Thats perfectly fine by me if you want to just take a night and go out with them, either with or without me
9/4/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: And yeah just go ahead and send me a link to the AirBnB, the sooner we book the better so let me know when you want to pull the trigger on it
9/4/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And I told Reid "yeah I'd feel bad sticking you with a second roommate for the weekend" and he just laughed and went "haha thanks I appreciate it"
9/4/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Do I think my room is out, but we can still hang out at my flat a bit if you want!
9/4/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: And I'm gonna guesssssss Chicken Marsala? The ruin bar looks so cool! Are they all that aesthetic?
9/4/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: WAIT A SECOND
9/4/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: REID AND HANNAH ARE GONE THAT WEEKEND BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SWITZERLAND!
9/4/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Oh!  So no need for the Airbnb?
9/4/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: That would be phenomenal timing
9/4/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'll talk to him about it
9/4/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/35782663?toddlers=0&adults=2&check_in=2019-09-27&check_out=2019-09-29&source_impression_id=p3_1567615553_Nz6VMnU%2B3UghTbqM
9/4/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: I don't think either of us thought about it
9/4/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs the link just in care
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: And no no chicken Marsala
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs still tentatively in the menu tomorrow for dinner
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: BUT I did have swarma
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Shawarma
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: It never lets me spell it right
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not even sure I know how to spell it right
9/4/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: V good though
9/4/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: My tummy is so full of pita and slightly spicy slightly sweet chicken
9/4/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Marion said she‚Äôs asking her Danish roommate if Sarah can sleep at their place too
9/4/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah also Sarah is more than welcome to hang out/explore/do fun city activities with us
9/4/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Any of your friends are if thats what you want
9/4/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Also I just won cards against humanity
9/4/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: But now have homework
9/4/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: So who's the real winner here
9/4/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: And shawarma! Heyy! That stuff is absolutely delicious
9/4/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Im glad I've found my spot
9/4/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: I actually hadn't had it before coming here
9/4/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah you‚Äôll be for sure third wheeling Sarah and me at least for parts of the weekend
9/4/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs just kind of how it goes
9/4/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get used to it
9/4/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Congrats!  You must be in a pretty witty mood tonight
9/4/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve only had shawarma once in Louisville
9/4/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: But mazel tov (the place we went tonight) is in the Jewish district and has Israeli streetfood and fusion food but all dressed up nice and fancy (and more expensive than street food)
9/4/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Guess so! It's funny because I honestly wasn't feeling great earlier
9/4/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: But I got some tacos in me so all is well
9/4/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Also that's right! The hip Jewish district! What have you guys done so far?
9/4/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: Well we live in the hip Jewish district
9/4/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: And all of the bars we‚Äôve been to so far have been here
9/4/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs where most of the ruins are
9/4/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: And instead ofpeople buying the buildings a fixing them, people bought them because they were cheap and kept them for the novelty
9/4/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: So there‚Äôs a lot of history just walking around this district
9/4/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: But nothing very structured in this district yet I guess
9/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Okay I have class early tomorrow so goodnight!
9/4/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: Okay, goodnight! I'll probably be doing homework for a while
9/4/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: This reading ended up being 56 pages üòê
9/4/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: So uhhh catch me sleeping in ‚úåÔ∏è
9/4/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Update I only need to read 18 of them
9/4/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Yey
9/5/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: Okay this is about the point in the night where I start to regret having a 2 hour nap
9/5/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: I'm not tired at all
9/5/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: Well I was TUCKERED OUT
9/5/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: Now I am also pretty tired
9/5/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: Like might make coffee tired
9/5/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: (I originally typed that as ‚Äúlike might make tired coffee)
9/5/19, 8:21 AM - Marianna: I just made a half decent cup of instant coffee
9/5/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: Hello! Good morning!
9/5/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: I might need a cup of tired coffee
9/5/19, 8:27 AM - Caleb: Tired coffee for a tired boy
9/5/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: And today's the day I have class until 6, so I might need something to not nod off
9/5/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: Honestly instant coffee really isn't that bad, and when you're tired its just way easier to throw together and make quickly
9/5/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: So! What do you have planned for the day?
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: Oh boy I‚Äôm not jealous of that
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: I only have a half day pretty much
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: We get to see BSM today
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs where class is and the closing ceremony
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: OH AND THEY PUT A KAHOOT ON THE SCHEDULE
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Caleb: KAHOOOOOOT
9/5/19, 8:31 AM - Caleb: Also BSM?
9/5/19, 8:32 AM - Marianna: but I did get a mini French press I just don‚Äôt have regular coffee grounds or know how to use it yet
9/5/19, 8:32 AM - Marianna: But instant coffee should be good to have on hand
9/5/19, 8:32 AM - Marianna: And yeah budapest semester in math
9/5/19, 8:32 AM - Marianna: The other abroad nerds here with us
9/5/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/Ngpf6UtPn4k
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Caleb: Oh right rifht right
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Although the Richmond kids we met last weekend were in another abroad program that I had need heard of so apparently there are more
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Caleb: I thought it was like a hall or something
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: And then yoga!  And cooking!
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Also
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Me legs
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: They hurt
9/5/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Walked 7 miles yesterday
9/5/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: Yoga? Scavenger hunt?
9/5/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: Ah yep
9/5/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: There we go
9/5/19, 8:34 AM - Marianna: I got my Fitbit back so now you‚Äôre gonna have to hear about the stats if they are insane I‚Äôm sorry
9/5/19, 8:34 AM - Marianna: Scavenger hunt
9/5/19, 8:34 AM - Marianna: We basically walked the entire length of the island
9/5/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: "oh man I ONLY walked 28 MILES yesterday I'm SLACKING"
9/5/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: kk Marianna I see u
9/5/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: Yeah just wait for it
9/5/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: This is me apologizing in advance
9/5/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: Sometimes it will be complaining
9/5/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: Sometimes it will be ‚ÄúI only took 100 steps today look at me GO ‚Äú
9/5/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: Ahaha no worries, I'll take both
9/5/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: I need to do more crossfit
9/5/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: My flat keeps saying they'll go and then no one does
9/5/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Revolt and go without them
9/5/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Or drag them by their feet
9/5/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Well the idea was that if I do it with my flat, they'll hold me accountable
9/5/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: But I'm needing to hold them accountable üôÉ
9/5/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs not good
9/5/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: I guess accountability is a circle
9/5/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: I mean I always find if I saw I‚Äôll do it every ______ day, I can do it better
9/5/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôm planning on doing yoga every Monday and Thursday and maybe occasionally Saturday
9/5/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Because that seems spread out and then I know to anticipate it
9/5/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs kind of why I like classes too
9/5/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: Because they are timed so you have to make time for them in your schedule not just _whenever_
9/5/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: Yeah that's a good idea
9/5/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: Maybe I'll bring it up tonight to my flat
9/5/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: They also have an open gym, which is a lot less intimating than a class
9/5/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: And I'd feel better going alone then
9/5/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: OKAaaaaayyy I should probably get up and shower, shouldn't I
9/5/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: That's the first step here
9/5/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: Maybe make some cawfee
9/5/19, 8:47 AM - Marianna: Yeah I can definitely see how it‚Äôd be nice to go with your people
9/5/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: I told two girls who were interesting in finding a yoga studio about where I went partially in hopes I‚Äôd be able to go with them in the future
9/5/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: Shower and coffee!
9/5/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: Or
9/5/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: Coffee and shower!
9/5/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: You got this
9/5/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a stellar Thursday come on come on get up get up
9/5/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: Gosh darn I just ran for the train and some lady got in my way so I had to swerve around and the doors shut but like if she hadn‚Äôt ignored me and let me pass I would have made it :(
9/5/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: Update got off at the wrong stop so now have to wait for the NEXT train going in the same direction as the one I just got off
9/5/19, 8:58 AM - Marianna: Coffee=ineffective this morning
9/5/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: AH SHOOT
9/5/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Im making scrambled eggs, and I added a little milk to it
9/5/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Then looked at the container, and it expired yesterday
9/5/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: It smelled sour
9/5/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: Oh well it was so little that I'm sure I'll be fine
9/5/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: Oh man nevermind I just read your text, you're having a slightly rougher morning than mine
9/5/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: But hey! It's all uphill from here, so there's that
9/5/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: Update: Hana got an A on the paper I spent four hours helping edit! It's a great morning again!
9/5/19, 9:48 AM - Marianna: Well how were the eggs
9/5/19, 9:48 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre doing Hungarian tongue twisters
9/5/19, 9:49 AM - Marianna: And the Hungarian guy who‚Äôs doing them with us was laughing at us so we made him to English tongue twisters
9/5/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: And then he was like oh yeah I see what you all have to go to
9/5/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: But HEY CONGRATS!  To you and to her!
9/5/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Now we‚Äôre learning Hungarian superstitions
9/5/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: Eggs were okay
9/5/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: Not great
9/5/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: We'll see how my stomach feels
9/5/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: Also ooo I'll definitely need you to teach me some
9/5/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: I love tongue twisters
9/5/19, 9:57 AM - Caleb: And also some superstitions, those are just super interesting
9/5/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: They had most of the same ones we have
9/5/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: ^^superstitions that is
9/5/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: One different one is if you sit on the corner of a table at dinner, you have bad marriage luck
9/5/19, 10:21 AM - Marianna: (But our guide said she has definitely sat on the corner and been fine with her husband so she thinks it‚Äôs fine
9/5/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: Oh!  And there are name days in Hungary
9/5/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: Like every name has a day
9/5/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: And for once my name is on something!
9/5/19, 10:24 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs on the list of approved girl names so my day is November 1
9/5/19, 10:34 AM - Caleb: Wait as in "Marianna"? Or do you have a Hungarian name now
9/5/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: No no Marianna is a Hungarian name apparently
9/5/19, 10:35 AM - Caleb: Oh! Awesome
9/5/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: Yeah
9/5/19, 10:35 AM - Caleb: You should throw a party or something
9/5/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: That's still so weird to me that there's a list of approved names
9/5/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: Like
9/5/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: What
9/5/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: Also that's hilarious, I'm glad your guide is having things work out for her despite her corner-sitting
9/5/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: AWWWWWWWW
9/5/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: I was unpacking the last few things from my luggage, and I found a card my parents wrote and stuck in the bottom
9/5/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Wasn't expecting to feel this way on a Thursday morning
9/5/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: Why'd they gotta do that to me
9/5/19, 11:25 AM - Caleb: Another update: going up the escalator from the metro station, I made direct eye contact with a man who almost tried to go down the up escalator, and we both started laughing
9/5/19, 11:25 AM - Caleb: Today is a roller coaster
9/5/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: AWWW that‚Äôs amazing f
9/5/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Both the card and the elevator
9/5/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Mostly the card
9/5/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm 1 shot in and it‚Äôs before noon
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Because we had a competition to smell palinka (which is Ike special Hungarian fruit brandy) and guess which fruit it was
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: And I was the only one who guessed correctly
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: So my reward was I got to drink a shot of it
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: But I guessed Apple...
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: So it was apple brandy
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: But when I stood up, everyone started shouting SHOT SHOT SHOT
9/5/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: so I did the shot
9/5/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Well see if I‚Äôm allergic
9/5/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: But I doubt it because it‚Äôs distilled so it should be processed
9/5/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: But I can feel the alc love this gonna be a fun metro ride home
9/5/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: UHHHHHHHHHH
9/5/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Please don't die
9/5/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: You have your epi pen right
9/5/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Yes yes
9/5/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Ok coolio
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: How was it?
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: You know there is a very small chance I‚Äôd ever need to use it
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Yeah but if doesn't mean I won't worry
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not being totally dangerous ignoring my allergies
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Also, doing shots before noon is a power move
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: I want to pick up some more palinka
9/5/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: A dangerous one, put a power move
9/5/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah that sounds absolutely delicious
9/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Because the rum was expensive and I bet the traditional palinka drunk is more normal and cheaper
9/5/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: I definitely want to try it when I'm there!
9/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Apparently raspberry palinka, raspberry juice, and lemonade üëÄ
9/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Robin has also said she wants to go out tonight
9/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: So unless Sarah doesn‚Äôt want to, I guess we‚Äôre doing that
9/5/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Git lit Marianna
9/5/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I mean you're _already_ pregaming
9/5/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: No no we want get lit Marianna to sleep for a semester or two
9/5/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: HEY

9/5/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Oh God this is how I die
9/5/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: This is how I want to die
9/5/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: That sounds delightful
9/5/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: AND you have a cocktail shaker now
9/5/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Oh! Also I checked, and you're totally totally welcome to stay with me the weekend of the 27th
9/5/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: I quickly passed it by Reid and he was totally cool with it, not that I thought he would have a problem with it
9/5/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd have to shake it
9/5/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sure we can
9/5/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Need to make ice cubes though
9/5/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Yay!  Now as long as Sarah can stay with Marion, we‚Äôre all set!
9/5/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: And as long as parents say yes and I get my class schedule so I can get airplane tickets
9/5/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: We just went on a new grocery store adventure to a new grocery store and I‚Äôm in love with it
9/5/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: Sarah thinks I‚Äôm so weird but I was NERDING out in there man
9/5/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: That lowkey sounds like so much fun
9/5/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: What did they have?
9/5/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Anything special?
9/5/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: Basil plant!
9/5/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: GOOD COOKIES
9/5/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: and other stuff they just add good selection
9/5/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Including a fifth of vodka for <$10
9/5/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt get the vodka on this trip but we will return
9/5/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: I feel like not getting the $10 fifth is a good life decision
9/5/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: And GOOD COOKIES
9/5/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Oh man I'd kill for some good cookies right now
9/5/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: I'm a lil hungry
9/5/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: This will be a long class
9/5/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: I mean we made the decision to get it later
9/5/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs like a eh life decision
9/5/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: (And it was partially made because they were out of stock soooo)
9/5/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: I just woke up from a nap
9/5/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: You got this
9/5/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: Class ain‚Äôt got nothing on you
9/5/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm taking Sarah to the mall to get a SIM card and stuff
9/5/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/5/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Oh my
9/5/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Class had SO many snacks
9/5/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: And I ate SO many snacks
9/5/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: But hey blood sugar is important right
9/5/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Lots of energy
9/5/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: OH got to love classes that have snacks
9/5/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: I just got out of yoga
9/5/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: And three AIT kids showed up!  So that was fun
9/5/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: They invited me out to grab food with them after but I explained I had to go find Sarah (who I just left at the mall for the past 2 hours)
9/5/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Ahaha now I'm imagining Sarah just stranded at the mall, lost like a kid waiting for his mom to come back to the grocery line because she needed to grab one more thing
9/5/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Hey!  I showed her the vodaphone store before I left so she got a SIM card so she‚Äôs not sooooo stranded
9/5/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs a large mall and she seemed happy to shop
9/5/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Haa good to hear it
9/5/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Any plans tonight?
9/5/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Making tokaji chicken
9/5/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Because apparently that‚Äôs the Hungarian wine variation similar to Marsala
9/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a white and doesn‚Äôt have a super high alcohol content so I‚Äôm skeptical
9/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: But we‚Äôre cooking with it so we‚Äôll see!
9/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: And then we are probably just going to go to a bar for drinks
9/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: With some other AIT people
9/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Do you have any plans?
9/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Hey that sounds like a whole lotta fun
9/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: I made dinner
9/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: It was delicious
9/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Now I'm fighting a food coma
9/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: But it's okay
9/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Because I'm gonna ride my bike
9/5/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: ... Ride my bike to an ICE CREAM shop with friends!
9/5/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: And then do homework because I'm putting it off hardcore
9/5/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: OH BIKE RIDE TO ICE CREAM SOUNDS LIKE BEST OF BOTH WORLD
9/5/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: And Oooo is that breaded?
9/5/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: What's on the menu?
9/5/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: Hey I respect your life decisions
9/5/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: Chicken Marsala
9/5/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: But with Hungarian wine
9/5/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: So I think I may call it tokaji csirke
9/5/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Look at you
9/5/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Innovating and stuff
9/5/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Go you

9/5/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: Yup
9/5/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: Oh and the fresh corn is soooo good
9/5/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Absolutely _magnificent_
9/5/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: That looks fantastic
9/5/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Have you ever had roasted corn? Like over a barbecue?
9/5/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: Okay update Nordic Mythology is hilarious
9/5/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: Thor is salty that a kings great grandmother dumped him for a giant
9/5/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: And Odin owes this king big time
9/5/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: There are alternating lines, one where Odin gives him a blessing, and the next is Thor being salty and cursing him
9/5/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: And this lasts like 2 pages
9/5/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Odin: 'I ordain that he shall live three life spans.
Thor: 'He shall commit a most foul deed in each one of them.
Odin: I ordain that he shall have the best of weapons and
clothing.
Thor: I ordain that he shall have neither land nor estates.
Odin: 'I give him this, that he shall have great riches.
Thor: I lay this curse on him, that he shall never be satisfied with what he has. 
Odin: I give him victory and fame in every battle.
Thor: 'I lay this curse on him, that in every battle he shall be
sorely wounded.
Odin: I give him the art of poetry, so that he shall compose verses as fast as he can speak.
Thor: 'He shall never remember afterwards what he composes.
Odin: I ordain that he shall be most highly thought of by all the
noblest and the best.
Thor: The common people shall hate him every one.
9/5/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never made it but I‚Äôve had it
9/5/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: OH wow Thor is PETTY
9/5/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Oh for REAL
9/5/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Honestly these myths are just great
9/5/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Okay update they're making me buy another episode
9/5/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: But they're gonna repay me in alcohol so it's all good
9/5/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: All of the Danes always walk in, and go "what is this" and then within 30 minutes they're INCREDIBLY involved in it
9/5/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: You are showing them the worst part of American culture
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: They LOVE IT
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: They know we all think it's trashy
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Hey get that alc‚Äî>online tv show   Exchange
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Good swap
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Oh oh you know it
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: It's also only like $2 an episode
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Bet you don‚Äôt have $10 vodka
9/5/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Uh no I actually don't
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: I've got like a $7 bottle of wine
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I still don‚Äôt like the premise of paying per episode
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: And just to remind you, you don't have a $10 bottle of wine either üôÉ
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: Uh well I splurged and got the $4 bottle of wine
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: Actually no
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I like it was $3 at most
9/5/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: LOVE budapest
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I don't either, but also I have like $20 of play credits from telling Google surveys about my alter ego
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: üôÉ
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Also WHAT
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: What
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Oh they give you like good money for answering surveys
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Yeah so 1000 ft is a little more than $3
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Okay now I'm incredibly jealous
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: And you can easily get bottles for 300-700 ft
9/5/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: I should smuggle wine from Budapest
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: What is this shit
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Why am I broke here
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Why did I come here
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Okay but not gonna lie I haven‚Äôt loved it as much as Italian wine
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs the program that worked for you
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Honestly, yeah
9/5/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: I wish I had more choices, but ohhh well
9/5/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: My parents gave me my monthly budget today and I‚Äôm never gonna hit it I don‚Äôt think
9/5/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: ... Caaaaant relate
9/5/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Love cheap Budapest
9/5/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: One because I'm not getting a budget
9/5/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: And two because everything costs an arm and a leg
9/5/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: And maybe a kidney
9/5/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: I need a budget or I feel crazy
9/5/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: I hate that
9/5/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: I lived in dc for a summer
9/5/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: So I know what that‚Äôs like
9/5/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Wait, a budget as in your parents are sending you money? Or a budget or as in your parents are advising you how to spend yours
9/5/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: What they‚Äôll pay while I‚Äôm over here
9/5/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Somethings o but I make notes of to pay them back for
9/5/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Because they are just paying my credit card bill while I‚Äôm over here so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it
9/5/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhhhh maybe I should try that on my parents
9/5/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: But then I‚Äôm gonna write I check when I get back of what I spend
9/5/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: That sounds much more relaxing
9/5/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: I hate feeling like my finances are on a wire
9/5/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôm spending most of money I spend on food or other things that are kind of essentials
9/5/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: But also, if I want to spend money, now is the time
9/5/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like spending money and I always feel so bad spending theirs so
9/5/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: But like if I go shopping for a new dress that‚Äôs on me
9/5/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: But travel and stuff that‚Äôs either part of the abroad experience or food they said they‚Äôd do
9/5/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Which is why I have to write a proposal
9/5/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: For each trip I plan to go on
9/5/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Least I can do
9/5/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think what I would want the most is travel, because I think pretty much everything is on me right now
9/5/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: But also I'm honestly not planning on traveling too much
9/5/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Because I can travel at any point, but there's SO much to do here and I might not have a chance to know a city this well again
9/5/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Ooooohhh maybe I'll see if they're willing to pay for in-city activities
9/5/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Like museums and whatnot
9/5/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Pull the education card
9/5/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: And the once in a lifetime card
9/5/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Good cards to keep on hand in my opinion
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: Hmmm
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: That some quality advice
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I should also probably call my parents more
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be here all night
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I've only talked to them once so far
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Actually well I‚Äôm going out in a bit
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: AHA
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: Ruin bar?
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah me too
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: But I send them lots of photos and updates
9/5/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: Oh okay that's good to hear it's not just me
9/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: I send bulk updates
9/5/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Yup!  With Sarah, rose, and robin
9/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: It'll be like 3 days and I'll just flood them with pictures
9/5/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Yeah I do that sometimes
9/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Heyyy! How is Sarah getting along with them?
9/5/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: She hasn‚Äôt really interacted with them
9/5/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: They met because I took her on the scavenger hunt with my language class
9/5/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: But nothing besides that
9/5/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Have you met anyone else? Or are you still just going to meet people on Sunday at the orientation
9/5/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Orientation starts tomorrow!
9/5/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Also the ruin bar is so cool
9/5/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also like a Mexican taqueria
9/5/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: So lots of Caribbean drinks
9/5/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: I saw your snapchat!
9/5/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: I'm v happy for you and Sarah
9/5/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Alright I got class early tomorrow, but I hope you're having a good night!

9/6/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you came over for packing
9/6/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure we would have kept talking as much during the summer
9/6/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Like I liked you enough to but we hadn‚Äôt talked all that much before then
9/6/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: But idk well never know
9/6/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Which I believe is a good thing
9/6/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: The version of the story that did happen is a good one so far
9/6/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's one thing I'm okay with not knowing :)
9/6/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: I also wonder what we would have done if I didn't ask if you wanted to call that one night when I moved to Philly
9/6/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: I just remember I had it typed out and was super nervous to send it
9/6/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/6/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: #bebold
9/6/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt think it was weird that you did
9/6/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: Especially after moving here and being by myself the first night, I totally get needing to talk to someone
9/6/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: And I think we still eventually would have talked over the phone
9/6/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: I like phone calls
9/6/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: And lord knows I was bored enough in dc to call just about everyone in my phone book

9/6/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Again, I kind of think that just would have happened
9/6/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Well, things just work out sometimes
9/6/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Gotta say you're preeeeeeeeeeeetttyyy fun to talk with

9/6/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Okay definitely one of my most called people
9/6/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: But don't let it get to your head
9/6/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: I feel like I can be annoying on the phone

9/6/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: No I swear I didn't I'm just an idiot normally
9/6/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: Robins coming in 30 min so unless you wanted to talk for 30 min or after we get back (at who knows what time), I think another night might be better?

9/8/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: SO TINY
9/8/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: are you like one of those peoples who‚Äôs obsessed with little things?
9/8/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: Uh what me no
9/8/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: I don't do that
9/8/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: Maybe
9/8/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: I feel attacked
9/8/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Oh! And the sushi story
9/8/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: So since my mom used to live in Japan (which I think I've told you that story), she used to just go out to sushi with me all the time
9/8/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: And we just kept hopping around sushi places, but none of them were super good or authentic
9/8/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/8/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: But THEN, we found this one place called SushiExpress which was a mall kiosk
9/8/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: And it was DELICIOUS
9/8/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: So we just used to go there all the time together every time we were in Lancaster
9/8/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Is it the best tasting though?
9/8/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Awww that‚Äôs such like a good tradition to have with your mom
9/8/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm not gonna pat myself on the shoulder or anything but this was pretty gosh darn worth cooking for 2 hours
9/8/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Kitchens a mess now though
9/8/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Definitely a keeper but not something to cook all the time because it‚Äôs kind of involved
9/8/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Shhhhhhhh
9/8/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Don't think about the kitchen
9/8/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Think about the food
9/8/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Also is the recipe on the doc?
9/8/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: The food is gone now though!
9/8/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: Belly is a HAPPY CAMPER though
9/8/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: And no not yet I‚Äôll put it on there eventually
9/8/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: Oh mine too
9/8/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: Packed with sushi
9/8/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: It's the best type of full
9/8/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: Hows your night been?
9/8/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Mines been good!  Got my final schedule finally!
9/8/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Well actually not quite yet
9/8/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: I need the registrar to answer a question and then I may drop a class or audit another
9/8/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your night been?
9/8/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Hey! That's awesome! How's it look?
9/8/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: And my nights been pretty good
9/8/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: It's my last night with everyone for a week, so we're all just hanging out
9/8/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/8/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Not to bad
9/8/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: 6 hours of class mwf but only 2 Tuesday Thursday
9/8/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: Wait why is it your last night for a week?
9/8/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: It's core course week, which means that everyone goes somewhere with their one main class
9/8/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: And most people are gone Monday through Wednesday, and I'm gone Thursday through Saturday
9/8/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: So it basically means I'm just not gonna see them for a week
9/8/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Except for maybe a little on Wednesday
9/8/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm going to shower and brush my teeth, but I'm free to call whenever after that!
9/8/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Maybe like 20 minutes?
9/8/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Oooooh got it got it
9/8/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: And yeah I just got out of the shower too so I‚Äôm free whenever!
9/9/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: https://greatescape.co/
9/9/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: GOOD MORNING AND HAPPY BORTHDAH AGAIN
9/9/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: that was a typo but I like the sound of it so it gets to stay
9/9/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: "bORthdAy"
9/9/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: Oooo gotta say I like it
9/9/19, 8:07 AM - Caleb: And thank you very much! üòÅ
9/9/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: BorthdaH
9/9/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm excited for day 1
9/9/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a nice day out
9/9/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs supposed to rain more but not until after my class starts and maybe it will even be done in the afternoon by the time I have to walk back!
9/9/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: Metros still a tad bit toasty in a rain jacket though
9/9/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: Also you sent that website and I thought I‚Äôd share what Sarah and I have been using idk if they have the same deals but it‚Äôs studentuniverse
9/9/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: Yeah it's going to be about the same here
9/9/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: It's mid 50s until about 2, then it's supposed to rain for the rest of the night
9/9/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: And I'm dumb because I'm fully aware of it but will still probably forget a raincoat
9/9/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: BUT AT LEAST I CHECKED!
9/9/19, 9:00 AM - Marianna: Oh well we‚Äôre in the 60s so hah
9/9/19, 9:00 AM - Marianna: Hey hey hey
9/9/19, 9:00 AM - Marianna: Friendly reminder to get your coat!
9/9/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: üòÅ
9/9/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: Thank you, I have my coat
9/9/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: And a warm sweater
9/9/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: Because it's absolutely one of those days
9/9/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: How many sweaters do you think I'll own by the time I get home?
9/9/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: Also I totally just spend 10 minutes talking with this guy outside the metro who was trying to get me to participate in a survey, and eventually I agreed, but at the end of the paperwork it asked for my residency number so I was like "hahaaaa sorry üôÉ" and left
9/9/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: UPDATE
9/9/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: 7-11 had buy one get one free croissants
9/9/19, 9:33 AM - Caleb: And Nathan siu got me one
9/9/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: Update 2: ULF BROUGHT HIS BABY TO CLASS
9/9/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: I have not broken out any sweaters yet
9/9/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: OH now I want a buy one get one free croissant
9/9/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: Or just a croissant in general low key
9/9/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: And hey maybe I‚Äôll get one today on my way home
9/9/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs so weird you have seven 11
9/9/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think we do
9/9/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Also I hate that I just typed out ‚Äúseven 11‚Äù
9/9/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: Also it has started raining quite heavily and we have the windows open in class and it‚Äôs NICE
9/9/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: Oh it's crazy
9/9/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: 7-11s are super super nice here
9/9/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: How are classes going so far?
9/9/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: Good!
9/9/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Really liked my cryptography class this morning!
9/9/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Our first homework is solving ciphers
9/9/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: BIG fan of that
9/9/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: My mobile class was a little boring he just told us the history of iOS and Android implementation
9/9/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: And we just had lunch and I‚Äôm genuinely mad at the lunch
9/9/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: So now Sarah and I are at the outpost of the coffee shop underneath of us which happens to be at AIT which is a crazy coincidence eating chocolate pastries under a metal awning listening to rain hit it
9/9/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/9/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: I really really hope that your homework for cryptography is basically just solving puzzles and learning a little theory
9/9/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: Because when we get back I will _absolutely_ want you to teach me some of them
9/9/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: (if you'd like that)
9/9/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: And that's unfortunate! I'm sure the class will still get a little more interesting
9/9/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: And wOaH what a wHaCkY coincidence, I still think they should give you a discount for being good neighbors or something
9/9/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: Also rain hitting a metal roof is definitely one of my favorite sounds ever
9/9/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: Yes I would totally love this semester if it‚Äôs just that
9/9/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: And if I remember any, yes I will teach you
9/9/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Have you seen the imitation game?
9/9/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre in our break for the comp bio now
9/9/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: I have! That's another one I guess
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I are the only white people
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: And oh I'm so happy that they give you breaks
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like oh is this what the ratio feels like for other people?
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah welcome to my summer
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: And awesome!
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: It's a wonderful experience honestly
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: Now I want to see the movie again
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: Like I feel like I might appreciate it more now than senior year of high school
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Oh same
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: We should watch it and you can give me expert commentary
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: Ah yes
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll correct their oversimplification
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: *EXPERT* Marianna
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: I really can be obnoxious to watch movies with
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: Only the highest of hopes here
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: You haven‚Äôt seen my worst
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: Hey hey I'll take my chances ‚ò∫Ô∏è
9/9/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: I guess the only movie we‚Äôve seen together is princess and the frog
9/9/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: I still pointed out all the Easter eggs and foreshadowing though
9/9/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: Yeah and I was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of singing
9/9/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: Well, I do have one pet peeve with watching movies with people
9/9/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: I! Was! In! A! Stressful! And! Confusing! Situation!
9/9/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt want to EMBARRASS myself
9/9/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: Ha look at me now
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Look at you now?
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: Now all I do is embarrass myself
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: And heres my pet peeve: If it's my first time watching the movie, and they're asking me questions that either are about to be answered, or we're not expected to know yet
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: @mom
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: HA
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Me too
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: It's great
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: Oooooh yeah
9/9/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Being embarrassing is more fun with company
9/9/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm also that person who when watching a movie I‚Äôve seen with a person who hasn‚Äôt seen it, will be like ha look at this look at this just wait for it _wait for it_
9/9/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: True
9/9/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Although I get embarrassed by other people being embarrassed much more than myself being embarrassing
9/9/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: Also?
9/9/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: ME TOO!
9/9/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: The only difference is that I didn't know the lyrics
9/9/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/9/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: Probably most nerve wracking movie watching _I've_ ever done
9/9/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: Horror movies be damned
9/9/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt you say you‚Äôre notoriously bad at remembering lyrics or is that someone else
9/9/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Also you weren‚Äôt the one who was like AH GOSH DARN MARIANNA YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MOVE for like 3 hours
9/9/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Or well maybe you _WERE_ thinking that but you don‚Äôt have to act on it
9/9/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
9/9/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: I think that was someone else
9/9/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: And maybe, just _maybe_ I had something like that in my head, but I figured I'd see what you were going to do because I _might_ have been a little nervous üòÅ
9/9/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: Wow I literally just woke up
9/9/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: Buthello to charljeans his ball
9/9/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: Now I have to get up, eat and go to yoga
9/9/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: Also I figured out what is ailing basil
9/9/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: I was drowning him
9/9/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm used to watering plants on the deck where the planters have holes to drain
9/9/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: But alas that is not the situation
9/9/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: So my bus was literally just floating
9/9/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
9/9/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: You know what they say
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: Great minds... wake up at 6:46pm from naps?
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: No
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: And also sounds like you've got a good night ahead of you
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: Low key ticked off at my mind
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: Oh?
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: But I do need to get up
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: Well I was very very nicely asleep
9/9/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: Like such a good sleep I woke up and was not sure what day it was or where I was
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: THOSE
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: ARE
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: THE
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: BEST
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Bonus points if there was a bunch of drool down your chin
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: No no I told you
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Me = princess
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Yeah yeah
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: So no drool
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: üëèPRINüëèCESS
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Hey reminder it‚Äôs your bday
9/9/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Or something
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Happy bday
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Thank you
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: :)
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: I'm also apparently going out to a bar with a couple friends from class for a drink
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Maybe a bite to eat too
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: But I had the best turkey burger so maybe not actually
9/9/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Also, just so you know, since Mr./Ms. Basil is surviving, it needs a name
9/9/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: There are like a dozen and a half police officers in riot gear outside the bank near us
9/9/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm CuriouS
9/9/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah!  Go have your first drink as a 21 year old!
9/9/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Oh you know I love turkey burgers
9/9/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: And well he‚Äôs not for sure gonna survive yet
9/9/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: If his condition improves I‚Äôll name him
9/9/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Well
9/9/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: If he does
9/9/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: I think "Lucky" is a decent name then
9/9/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: And ooooooo I'd ask you to send pictures, but please stay safe
9/9/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Sounds eventful
9/9/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: I wonder if you can use a police scanner in Budapest
9/9/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: That's what I did in Philly and it never failed to entertain
9/9/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Helloooooooo
9/9/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Hope you're having a good night :).
9/9/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Oh good point will definitely keep that in mind if he does survive
9/9/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Idk
9/9/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: My mom uses a police scanner too
9/9/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: And hellllloooooo
9/9/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: How are you
9/9/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm walking back from yoga and it‚Äôs chilly and everything is wet from the rain but I feel good so it‚Äôs a good night
9/9/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Update cops are gone so I guess everything‚Äôs okay now
9/9/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: Glad cops are gone
9/9/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: Sad theres no good story
9/9/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: And I'm great! Minimal typos so I think I'm doing ok
9/9/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: We're still at the bar, but just kinda hanging out
9/9/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: These guys are super cool, I definitely want to be friends with them
9/9/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: What are you up to?
9/9/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Ah you drinking?
9/9/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: And these are all guys you have class with?

9/10/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: I had a very very very fun day
9/10/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: And yeah, we went to a bar and had 3 rounds of beer over the course of the night
9/10/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: It was a place called Taphouse, and they have 61 beers on tap
9/10/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: Several of which were delicious
9/10/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: And HELLLLLLOOOOOO in 17 days! I already can't Wai t
9/10/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: Wait*
9/10/19, 12:59 AM - Caleb: I'll start finding things to do
9/10/19, 12:59 AM - Caleb: What ratio of hanging out/"hanging out"/exploring and touristy stuff do you want to do?
9/10/19, 12:59 AM - Caleb: And thank you again, it was a very fun birthday :)
9/10/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: Talk to you tomorrow, good night!
9/10/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: Okay random update both of my brothers texted my happy birthday
9/10/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: Even Josh!
9/10/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: That might seem dumb and kinda trivial to you, but it really really made my night
9/10/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: Good night again!
9/10/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: Oh that place actually does sound cool
9/10/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: What made the beers taste good?
9/10/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: I was thinking at least all of Saturday we do touristy stuff, and then going to a club with my davidson gals that night
9/10/19, 8:58 AM - Marianna: And then maybe a slow start to Sunday but still see something else if we can then
9/10/19, 8:58 AM - Marianna: And everything else can be some mix of the types of hanging out
9/10/19, 8:58 AM - Marianna: And hey that‚Äôs awesome!
9/10/19, 9:00 AM - Marianna: Meanwhile: this conversation happened last night in the math kids group chat
9/10/19, 9:01 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/10/19, 9:01 AM - Marianna: You have to open it to get the last guys text
9/10/19, 9:03 AM - Caleb: .... What the hell did I just read
9/10/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: Idk it‚Äôs a bold move to share that with like 65 kids you‚Äôre abroad with after only a few weeks
9/10/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Wait
9/10/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: There are 65
9/10/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: 65 kids in that chat
9/10/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: 68 technically
9/10/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: If we‚Äôre being exact here
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: That's a POWER move hot dang
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: They later went into their favorite numbers
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: ... How many said 69
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: I bet it was like half of them
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: Some kid i^i and how the roots of unity were cool and I liked that
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: None actually
9/10/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: They may be weird but they‚Äôre intellectually weird
9/10/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: Okay you see that's actually petty cool now
9/10/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: Intellectually weird is my favorite type of weird
9/10/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: It's why I love my friends so much
9/10/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: They're the smartest people I know, but in so many different areas that it's always really lively, interesting, educational, weird discussions
9/10/19, 9:16 AM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs the best part of davidson people
9/10/19, 9:17 AM - Marianna: And I hope eventually I can get those convos out of people here
9/10/19, 9:17 AM - Marianna: Especially drunk, I always like to theorize about comp sci
9/10/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: Ooooooo oo lord I'm gonna get you to do that sometime
9/10/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: But yeah
9/10/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: I sure do love my Davidson people
9/10/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: And I honestly can't wait to get back to them
9/10/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: Because even among Davidson people, they're really special to me
9/10/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: Oh hey! Wanna know something crazy I realized last night?
9/10/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: I only have one week of classes in October
9/10/19, 9:42 AM - Marianna: Hey I think I tried
9/10/19, 9:42 AM - Marianna: I debugged my code when I brought you back to new dorm and you were not having it
9/10/19, 9:42 AM - Marianna: Which admittedly was a weird thing for me to do but it happens sooooo
9/10/19, 9:42 AM - Marianna: And woah
9/10/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: Because China, break, and then the London week?  Or is that some other time
9/10/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Woah woah woah
9/10/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Hang on here
9/10/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: I was into the debugging
9/10/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: I just felt kinda useless, because being an AT meant that if someone's trying to debug I felt obligated to help
9/10/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: And also I totally got you to explain the *schoop * thing to me
9/10/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: That was fun
9/10/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: And yeah, it's a break, then China, then class for a week, then I'm traveling with my class to London
9/10/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: Uh really you were like Marianna is this really the time to debug
9/10/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: Which is admittedly really wasnt
9/10/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt worry you can help me drunk debug or just sit there and look pretty while I drunk debug in the future
9/10/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Schwooop is a fun thing
9/10/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Still don‚Äôt totally know what it means
9/10/19, 9:58 AM - Caleb: Hey me neither but I enjoyed the explanation
9/10/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: Well same
9/10/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: Except Thomas Cameron explained it to me
9/10/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: And then tested me on it
9/10/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: Much less fun than just knowing it let me tell you
9/10/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Well
9/10/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: I just got out of class early
9/10/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Like an hour and a half early
9/10/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: But now we're gonna go to the Schwarma place
9/10/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: And have to reconvene at 3:50
9/10/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: So
9/10/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/10/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: Woah that‚Äôs nice
9/10/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: I just got out of class (on time) and am gonna chill at school for like an hour and then head home for lunch because our apartment is being cleaned from 1-2pm today
9/10/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Did not expect that the apartment would be cleaned by someone else and I am LOVING it like it‚Äôs so nice to not have to
9/10/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: ... You what now
9/10/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Oh my sweet lord
9/10/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Life is good in Budapest, isn't it
9/10/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Also, had a good nap
9/10/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Good nap made me tired
9/10/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Tired makes me want to nap
9/10/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: Nap makes me tired again
9/10/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: Is this an endless cycle
9/10/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: Yes but it‚Äôs such a nice cycle ain‚Äôt it
9/10/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: I ended up getting food on campus because a large group of people were and I WANT PEOPLE
9/10/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: And then a few of us went to the old ancient ruins near our campus
9/10/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm on the train home now
9/10/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll nap
9/10/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: Blurb from talk I'm at
9/10/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: "this follows the whole 'no free lunch theorem'. Okay actually today we do have free lunch, but not in that way."
9/10/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: What is the no free lunch theorem
9/10/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: And what‚Äôs the talk?
9/10/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: And how are you?
9/10/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Well
9/10/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: We went to this company called Corti
9/10/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: https://corti.ai/
9/10/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Basically it's a startup that developed an algorithm which is a live diagnostic tool for calls with 911 dispatchers
9/10/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: So it can make an automated diagnosis and prioritize resources like ambulances
9/10/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: And the no free lunch theorem basically says that you can make algorithms that work really well for some things, but you can't get it to do EVERYTHING well
9/10/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: And I'm great! It was a really interesting talk, and now I kinda want to see if I could maybe get an internship there
9/10/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: How are you?
9/10/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Oh wow that‚Äôs all so cool
9/10/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Also I love that theorem
9/10/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: I want that on a flag
9/10/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Or like maybe I‚Äôll make that my insta bio
9/10/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Like I can do some things but not everything
9/10/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good
9/10/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I just went grocery shopping
9/10/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: And we bought aperol for aperol spritzes
9/10/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: And I made them
9/10/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: But like REALLY big ones
9/10/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: So we‚Äôll see how drunk we end up on a Tuesday
9/10/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: But whatever happens, it was an accident to make them this big I didn‚Äôt think how large 2 parts of wine and aperol would be
9/10/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: Will keep you updated
9/10/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Ooooooo lord Marianna
9/10/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: I hope you don't have too much work tonight
9/10/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: But if you don't, and feel like you wanna talk, a chat with Marianna/Drunk Marianna is always a welcome surprise!
9/10/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Also yeah, the more I think of it, that would be a good motto for me
9/10/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Because my God I always try to get free lunch
9/10/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: In both ways
9/10/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: And it doesn't always work out for me
9/10/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: In only one way
9/10/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: And now I'm out with Nathan, Woo, and Derek getting Szhchuan food
9/10/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: I've relinquished all control over what we're ordering
9/10/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: Pray for me
9/10/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: It's gonna be hot
9/10/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: Update Sarah and I are bringing wine Wednesday to life by hosting one tomorrow in the park near us
9/10/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: We!  Want!  Friends!
9/10/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: And you may get a drunk Marianna call
9/10/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: Sober Marianna also wants to call you to talk about you visiting Budapest logistics
9/10/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: Not urgent though
9/10/19, 6:34 PM - Marianna: Hey free lunch is a good thing
9/10/19, 6:34 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
9/10/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: Drink lots of beer and you‚Äôll be fine
9/10/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/10/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Tonight I learned: eat first, ask questions later
9/10/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Tripe is odd
9/10/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: And unexpected
9/10/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: But good
9/10/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Very good
9/10/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Do I want to know what tripe is
9/10/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs looks good
9/10/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Not like necessarily something I‚Äôd like
9/10/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: But not gross
9/10/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Well I'll hold off on telling you then
9/10/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Also, weird activity suggestion for when you're here: that Sunday is the opening ceremony for a new metro line
9/10/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: And I know it seems kinda trivial and like oh well, but this is the biggest project in Copenhagen since 1600, and will totally revolutionize the way people use the city
9/10/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: So! If there's an opening ceremony and it's something you'd be interested in, we should think about it
9/10/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Okay then I‚Äôll thank you for not telling me
9/10/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs cools but maybe not the top of my list for Copenhagen
9/10/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Marion and I were talking today and she suggested Tivoli gardens
9/10/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: And I looked at the fredricksborg castle and that one looks really cool to me
9/10/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: And I NEED to get on the trampoline sidewalks while I‚Äôm there
9/10/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: She also suggested renting a boat and bringing dinner and wine and hanging on that a little bit idk any of those details but she seemed to
9/10/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah that sounds like a pretty full day!
9/10/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: The time is yours
9/10/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: And I also don't want to monopolize you, so if you want time with just you and your friends please just let me know!
9/10/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: The boat sounds good too, but it might end up being a little too cold
9/10/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: Wind and water and darkness don't mix too well for bad circulation
9/10/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Oh that is a good point
9/10/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Maybe Sunday and lunch then?
9/10/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: And don‚Äôt worry I want to spend the time with you
9/10/19, 8:28 PM - Marianna: But a perfect world I‚Äôd be able to spend time with everyone
9/10/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: Also I like dates
9/10/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: Just putting it out there
9/10/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/10/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Sunday lunch on a boat sounds spectacular, has Marion already done boat renting? I know a couple groups of people did, but I'm not totally sure who
9/10/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Also it makes me really happy that you want to spend the time with me, but also I do want you to have quality time with your gals
9/10/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: And I'd love to hang out with you and them if it's something you'd want, but also I absolutely get that you might want some time with just them
9/10/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: I mean, if I'm coming to Budapest like two weeks after that, I'm sure I can live with you spending some time just with them. I'll definitely have more than my fair share of you, and you won't get to see them until January so I promise I won't be hurt :)
9/10/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: And hey
9/10/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Guess
9/10/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: What
9/10/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I like dates too
9/10/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: So I think we could work something out üòÅ
9/10/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know if she has yet or not
9/10/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: And yeah we‚Äôll figure something out
9/10/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah!  We have to talk about Budapest planning whenever you want to
9/10/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: AND YAY GOOod FOr WorKinG SOmThiNg OuT
9/10/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: hey how‚Äôs ya night
9/10/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Hey :)
9/10/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: :)))
9/10/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: My nights been pretty good
9/10/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: I basically just hung out with Nathan, Woo, and Derek
9/10/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Came back
9/10/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Hung out with Emma
9/10/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Watched some Netflix
9/10/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: And now I'm looking at lenses I can't afford
9/10/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: OH YEAH by the way all the guys I've been hanging out with are into photography
9/10/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: My friend Woo has a XT100, and I REALLY want to try it out because it's mirror less
9/10/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: And woAh there partner, jokes on you I love dates
9/10/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: But like I said, I don't want to selfishly hog you this weekend. Also, I don't want to just leave Sarah wondering around on her own or something
9/10/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: But if it's a date you want, I'd be delighted :)
9/10/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: And yeah that sounds good, I'm around all night so whenever you want to call is good with me
9/10/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Are these the same guys you went to the bar with yesterday?
9/10/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Yep! They are
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: Yes no also Sarah is currently feeling a little down and anti-people-being-cute-And-liking-each-other
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: So that will have to be limited
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want her to hate me
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: The kids in my class are basically the only DIS kids left here, so we're becoming friends now
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Pretty fun
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: And oh
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Awww Sarah :(
9/10/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: She throws some nasty glares at the people on the metro making out during our morning commute
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Ooooh that makes sense
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah I wasn't sure how much PDA you like, but I think this answers it for this weekend at least
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Poor Sarah though
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: That's not a fun spot to be in
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm fine with pda as long as other people aren‚Äôt uncomfortable
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah yeah me too
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Well drunk Marianna doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: I just try to be cognizant
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: But she doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck about many things
9/10/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Idk, I feel like a flying fuck would be pretty heavy PDA
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: AH
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: _ba dum tss_
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: AH
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: NO
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: TAKE IT BACK
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: It was too good but too true
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Too late
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Puns already out there
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: No takesies-backsies
9/10/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: A friend who will not be named once had to explain how he was kind of in the mile high club
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Oh oh God no
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Wait kind of
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: So I guess that would be a flying fuck
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Kind of
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Kind of?
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Kind of
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Kind of...
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: You probably don‚Äôt want to know
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: What
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Did he JO in the bathroom or something
9/10/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Because you know what they call that right
9/10/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: But also the people on these metros are CRAZY like even the Hungarians who have talked to us about culture shock have been like ah you‚Äôll see people with their tongues done other peoples throats no one likes it but it happens
9/10/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: And well yes he did
9/10/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: But he still managed to phrase it all very oddly
9/10/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: And his reason he did was even worse
9/10/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Ah yes, I believe it's called _highjacking_ Marianna
9/10/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: And oh I'm so so curious
9/10/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Why did he do it
9/10/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Attractive stewardess?
9/10/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: HAHAHA I like that better
9/10/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/10/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Girlfriend teased him a little too hard before the flight?
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: ‚ÄúIt was a long flight and I realized I could totally go do it and claim I was kind of in the mile high club so I did‚Äù or something
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: ....
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: He also claims he realized it was dumb halfway through
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: He was like what am I doing
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Oh my God who is it
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Please tell me it's someone I know
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: I have no idea how this story came into conversation and it was like within the first month of school too I think
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: You do
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: So I won‚Äôt say
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: OH WHAT
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: WAS IT HARRY
9/10/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: It was Harry
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: NO
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Couldn't be Barry
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Harry*
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Oh lord now as far as I'm concerned it was all of your friends
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: IT WAS MAX
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: How would it have been all of my friends
9/10/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Idk, it's now a collective guilt
9/10/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: And I think those two would be hurt that you‚Äôd assume so quickly it was them
9/10/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: I barely know Harry tbh
9/10/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: They do do admittedly dumb things
9/10/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre both lovely and enjoyable
9/10/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And max is the only one I could see realizing it in the middle and _still_ finishing
9/10/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Max is great but I could see it
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: And I'm not saying you can't be lovely and enjoyable after doing dumb things like that
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: I just feel bad for whoever used it after them
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Like, it's sticky
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Oh for sure
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: And they don't flush with water in airplanes
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Ew
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Ew
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: We can stop right there
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Kinda inconsiderate
9/10/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: EW
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Yeah also long flight
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: It was probably stuck to the plastic walling of toilet
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: ANYWAY
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: EW
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: HEY
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: OH NO
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: NO
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: :(
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: Marianna I'm not the one that did it
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: The burden is not on me
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm in bed if you did want to call sometime but I should probably go to bed by 11
9/10/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Yes but you are still talking about it
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Man I forgot this story
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Aha
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Well
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: I love my friends they do such weird shit
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah I've noticed
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: But boy oh boy
9/10/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: A real endearing bunch
9/10/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: And yeah! Let me grab some water
9/10/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: 5 minutes?
9/10/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Works for meeeee
9/10/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: You are stuck with sober Marianna though
9/10/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Drunk Marianna never made an appearance tonight because Marianna as a collective being paced herself
9/10/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Tipsy Marianna did do some homework and wrote a program to crack the cipher for her crypto class
9/10/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Hey I'll take any Marianna regardless of state
9/10/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: But only on days that end in "y"
9/10/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: (end with y in Angol)
9/10/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: J√≥ √©jt aludj j√≥l!
9/10/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: J√≥ √©jszak√°t!
9/10/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I do like this language and learning it
9/10/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Okay sleep now
9/11/19, 7:21 AM - Marianna: Good
9/11/19, 7:21 AM - Marianna: Morning
9/11/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: Please take one for the team and sleep in a little more for the both of us
9/11/19, 8:12 AM - Marianna: Update Sarah found a cool tinder boy last night so hopefully we get a Hungarian friend shortly
9/11/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: Aye aye captain
9/11/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: More sleep, coming right up
9/11/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: And HEY THAT'S COOL! I'm guessing that means she's looking for a boy over there? Also what ended up happening to her and Owen?
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: Owen is a jackass
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: But we knew that
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: But she finally figured it out
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre still friends somehow
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: Hooray for Sarah
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: Oh
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: It might be fine
9/11/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: Eh I'm sure it will
9/11/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: But yeah she‚Äôs at least having fun on tinder idk if she‚Äôs seriously looking but it‚Äôs still fun to swipe and see people around us
9/11/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: So is Hungarian boy a romantic interest then? Or just hoping for a friend
9/11/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: Only run into a few AIT people so far
9/11/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhh yeah, makes sense
9/11/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: I want to meet him to be his friend
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: Oh hahaha no I was talking about Sarah
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know how seriously she wants him to be a romantic interest
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: I mean I was _assuming_ you'd want him as a friend
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a little early to say I think
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: And yeah I just hope this doesn't turn into Hungarian Brian though
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Marianna: Oh you know me so well
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Marianna: STOP DONT EVEN THINK OF THAT
9/11/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: Not comparing Sarah to Molly
9/11/19, 8:47 AM - Marianna: Well we think our rooms are actually pretty well noise contained
9/11/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: I just hope it doesn't get too involved/serious and break anyone's heart
9/11/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: That's no fun for anyone
9/11/19, 8:47 AM - Marianna: Like she couldn‚Äôt hear me talking on the phone and we can play music separately
9/11/19, 8:47 AM - Marianna: Oh
9/11/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: You always say that but I still think people can do involved flings and come out of it okay
9/11/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: As long as you know it‚Äôs just a involved fling
9/11/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: Like consistent hookups are good things I feel like even if there‚Äôs no hope of dating
9/11/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: But what do I know
9/11/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so inexperienced on all these fronts but Some of my friends do it pretty well
9/11/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: Yeah, that's fair
9/11/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: I don't have too much experience here either, but I just know if it was me I feel like I would have trouble keeping emotional distance and saying goodbye
9/11/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: I mean, I hate goodbyes anyway so I feel like it's something I couldn't do
9/11/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: So when are you guys meeting him?
9/11/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/j-GnuHwK8mw
9/11/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: Yeah
9/11/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm fine with that haha
9/11/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve made it through approximately 1hr/6hrs of class
9/11/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: You haven‚Äôt taken comp org yet have you?
9/11/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: Because we‚Äôre currently just doing stuff we did there basically
9/11/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs the stuff I liked!
9/11/19, 9:55 AM - Caleb: Hey! Perfect
9/11/19, 9:55 AM - Caleb: And no I actually havent taken comp org
9/11/19, 9:55 AM - Caleb: The only CS class I took was 221 actually
9/11/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: The rest of it is just me making stuff up I guess hahaha
9/11/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: Wow
9/11/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs crazy
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: But you‚Äôve got way more real life stuff on me
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: Also
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: They have blankets in the lounge here
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: So I stole one for class because I‚Äôm FREEZING
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: I think they still have the ac on
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Caleb: Oh that's amazing
9/11/19, 9:58 AM - Caleb: That's the absolute best and I'm happy for you
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: Meanwhile I haven't actually left my bed yet
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: I think I already told you about the nap pads too?
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: UGH JEALOUS
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: What, jealous of my bed?
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: well yes
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Becaus eit has you
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: But also just that you‚Äôre in bed
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: Don't worry you can try it out eventually ;)
9/11/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: Oh shit you one upped me
9/11/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: Hot dang
9/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: Ha
9/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: Look at me trying to be smooth
9/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: Okay class again bye
9/11/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: Look at you ~trying to~ be smooth
9/11/19, 10:01 AM - Caleb: Okay! Have a good class!
9/11/19, 10:01 AM - Caleb: I'll probably get up
9/11/19, 10:01 AM - Caleb: Probably
9/11/19, 10:01 AM - Caleb: Maybe
9/11/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: Update I'm still in bed
9/11/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: The cross through didnt show up in the preview of the message on my home screen and I was like EXCUSE YOU
9/11/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: how‚Äôs the bed
9/11/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm eating a chocolate pastry thing
9/11/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: aHA
9/11/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Bamboozled
9/11/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: And beds good
9/11/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: My next class is in the same classroom and the Same seat as my last one so it‚Äôs 4 hours right here for me wed /thurs
9/11/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: I just watched like a 20 minute instructional cinematography video where they talk about the emotional impact of focal lengths
9/11/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: And oooooooooohhhh that's brutal
9/11/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: I mean on the bright side, you don't need to b-line it to class or anything
9/11/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Get up, get some water, stretch or something
9/11/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs cool
9/11/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: I know nothing about emotional impacts there
9/11/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Sounds interesting
9/11/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Although I may just ask for a recap from you and not watch a 20 min video on it
9/11/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Well the school is also tiny
9/11/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Like there are 4 classrooms
9/11/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Well 5 if you count the design studio but I never go in there
9/11/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: But yeah I‚Äôm up and walking during the break
9/11/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: But I wore the new shoes for day 2 and they are not broken in yet so my feet are kind of rubbing and it‚Äôs not super comfy
9/11/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Wait 4 classrooms? That's absolutely insane
9/11/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: It's crazy to think your entire program was about the size of my high school graduating class
9/11/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: I feel like you're going to come out of this with some really, really good friends
9/11/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: And are these the vans? That's weird
9/11/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: I feel like they should be broken in really quickly, being canvas and whatnot
9/11/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: Have you ever worn suede shoes? They take _forever_ to break in, I think I still have callouses from them
9/11/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah I like how small it is but it‚Äôs also less people to choose friends from
9/11/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve liked some that I‚Äôve met
9/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah but they‚Äôre still pretty structured
9/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs mostly the back of the shoes
9/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre also the platform ones so they‚Äôre not quite as soft I think
9/11/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: And yes!  But they were heels so it was it‚Äôs own thing
9/11/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: I FOUND A WAFFLE HOUSE
9/11/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: But is not A Waffle House right
9/11/19, 1:28 PM - Caleb: Shhhh let me believe
9/11/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs just a Waffle House no relation to the us chain?
9/11/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/11/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: Have fun
9/11/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm embracing there are no establishments I recognize
9/11/19, 1:31 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: Well the school is next to Microsoft and I recognize that I guess
9/11/19, 1:31 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm also embracing the no establishments I recognize
9/11/19, 1:31 PM - Caleb: And am ignoring the ones I do
9/11/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: WOAH I just learned something really cool
9/11/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: Remember how on like my first day here, I sent a picture of that golden, metallic balloon floating in the stone gray metro station?
9/11/19, 2:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 2:23 PM - Caleb: Well I was just walking, and saw a plaque that said that these are a contemporary art piece
9/11/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: The purpose was, "to make people stop for a moment to take a break from their daily routines, look up and smile, or just be a little more aware of their surroundings and the people we pass along the way"
9/11/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: I absolutely love it
9/11/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: oh I LOVE that
9/11/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the first picture?
9/11/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I found the Walmart equivalent
9/11/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: And bought fuzzy blankets
9/11/19, 2:35 PM - Marianna: But they gave us little Harry Potter figures on the way out
9/11/19, 2:35 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: The first picture is inside The Church of Our Savior
9/11/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: I've basically realized that today I'm just doing an architectural scanner hunt today
9/11/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: And this is an even cooler one
9/11/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Also I'm happy for you and your fuzzy blankets and Harry Potter figurines
9/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: OH I also saw that on the list of places to see
9/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so pumped for the fuzzy blanket
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: I had a fuzzy blanket
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: And I put it in the lounge
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: My room is too cold for no covers and too warm for the duvet
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: And now it is gone
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: And I'm very sad
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Well whoopdido good for you
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: NO
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: :(
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Bruh
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: THIS ISNT THE UBER FLUFFY ONE RIGHT
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Oor
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Oof
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: It may or may not have been the uber fluffy one
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: (it was)
9/11/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Nooooooo
9/11/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: Well who has access to the lounge?  Is it just your flat?
9/11/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Idk, I'll ask if anyone's seen it
9/11/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: It's just my flat
9/11/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Someone probably assumed it was someone else's
9/11/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: I hope you get it back
9/11/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: It looked heavenly
9/11/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: I doubt anyone did it maliciously
9/11/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a small flat there are a limited number of suspects
9/11/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Yeaaah I'll try not to view them as suspects for now
9/11/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: I don't need it quite yet, but boy do I want it back eventually
9/11/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: If not, it was pretty cheap so I'll just snag another
9/11/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: How's your day been?
9/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: But hey it‚Äôs never nice to lose something like that
9/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm about to start class #3
9/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: Well see if I Last
9/11/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Well Sarah has a date tomorrow!
9/11/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm going to just read at the same bar to be there for her
9/11/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: WOOHOO go Sarah!
9/11/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Tinder boy?
9/11/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Oh my God, ISHTI?
9/11/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: Jkjk

9/11/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: I just had a phone call with Spyros
9/11/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: We're figuring out logistics
9/11/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: And I now have a very clear to do list
9/11/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: Which always makes me feel better
9/11/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: OH
9/11/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: AND I FOUND MY FUZZY BLANKET
9/11/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: How are you?
9/11/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Oh how‚Äôd the call go!
9/11/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: And YAY I AM SO EXCITED FOR YPU
9/11/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: I am good
9/11/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: I am cooking
9/11/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good state for Marianna
9/11/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Well
9/11/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: I got some news that complicates the week a bit, I'm waiting to hear back from Spyros but we might need to talk about me visiting again
9/11/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Nothing super bad, I just might need to leave a bit earlier than anticipated
9/11/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: But I'll let you know what he says when he replies
9/11/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: But on the bright side, it looks like it's super viable for me to just fly out of Budapest then
9/11/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Oh okay
9/11/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: :(
9/11/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Nah I‚Äôm kidding whatever works for you works for me
9/11/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: I mean, yeah :(
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: No I am kidding it‚Äôs all good
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: The schedule says that the bulk of the events are on the 13th
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Ooooooh
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Well that makes sense
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: I mean nah I want to spend time with you in Budapest, so I wouldn't say "good"
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Well actually no that‚Äôs a Sunday that‚Äôs weird
9/11/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: WAIT

9/11/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Train departs at 6 from Copenhagen central
9/11/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Also I need to figure out what I'm doing for the Budapest/China transition
9/11/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: Because I really want to spend time with you, and I really should go to the first day of this conference because it's also the day Spyros/Christos are presenting
9/11/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: So I'm just like ugh
9/11/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: why cant things work out
9/11/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: Hey you‚Äôre welcome here any time
9/11/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: It sucks that you can‚Äôt be here for Saturday just because it‚Äôs a whole day to sight see
9/11/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: But come as early as you want
9/11/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: And we can do the majority of the sightseeing Thursday afternoon
9/11/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: And other fun things at night
9/11/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah it crossed my mind that _maybe_ I could come the weekend prior to get the sightseeing, and then fly out earlier, but also that's a long time for you to have me around and I don't want to get in the way of classes or wear you out
9/11/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Idk, it would probably be best if we just could call about this, especially now that I know that I just need to book a one way ticket and Penn will take care of getting me home
9/11/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Also that looks DELICIOUS, what is it?
9/11/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: Okay let me shower and then I have a little bit of time before wine Wednesday?
9/11/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: And Roman style chicken!
9/11/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: Or we can do tomorrow
9/11/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: I know you have to sleep
9/11/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: I think I'm going to shoot for bed at 10, and also I'm going to be traveling and with my class the whole day tomorrow
9/11/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: It can be super super quick though
9/11/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Hellooooooo (probably) tipsy Marianna! I hope you're having fun and people showed up
9/11/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I'm going to bed, but goodnight I'll talk to you tomorrow!
9/12/19, 1:33 AM - Marianna: Hi this is very far along Marianna testing you
9/12/19, 1:33 AM - Marianna: I had a OHENOMENAL
9/12/19, 1:33 AM - Marianna: NIGHT
9/12/19, 1:33 AM - Marianna: We had a good group of people and good shitty wine (the challenge was to bring cheap $1 dollar wine)
9/12/19, 1:33 AM - Marianna: And I like you
9/12/19, 1:33 AM - Marianna: Wait forget that for a minute
9/12/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: I know you like reading texts from me in the morning
9/12/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: So good morning cutie
9/12/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt wait to be in Copenhagen
9/12/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: And I really hope you‚Äôre sleeping deeply or your phone is on do not disturb
9/12/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: I have so many things I want to tell you
9/12/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre so great
9/12/19, 1:35 AM - Marianna: Handsome, smarter than the majority of people I‚Äôve met at Davidson, and so thoughtful
9/12/19, 1:35 AM - Marianna: It kills me
9/12/19, 1:35 AM - Marianna: Anyway I‚Äôm c drunk so I should do to bed
9/12/19, 1:36 AM - Marianna: Ya girl has class in like 7 hours
9/12/19, 1:36 AM - Marianna: Woooooo
9/12/19, 1:36 AM - Marianna: Well o guess I not ya girl but you get what I mean
9/12/19, 1:37 AM - Marianna: Okay anyway goodnight I hope you have so much fun this week on your core class and don‚Äôt forget about me!  Send as many pictures as you can but don‚Äôt worry about it if you‚Äôre too busy with your people there
9/12/19, 1:37 AM - Marianna: Oh wait one more thing you make me smile and yeah a lot of people can do that but it‚Äôs such a good type of smile that doesn‚Äôt happen too often so please keep talking to me if you want to
9/12/19, 1:38 AM - Marianna: Also I feel like I‚Äôm miraculously not doing typos but I always feel like that I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find them in the morning
9/12/19, 1:38 AM - Marianna: Goodnight and kisses üòò
9/12/19, 4:12 AM - Caleb: Holy COw
9/12/19, 4:13 AM - Caleb: How am I alive and functioning at this time
9/12/19, 4:39 AM - Caleb: Also holy coW those texts but a big ol' smile on my face at 4 am. Do you know how hard it is to get me to grin like an idiot at 4 am? VERY
9/12/19, 4:47 AM - Caleb: Sometimes when you send me texts like this, I get a little overwhelmed, and it's like a VERY GOOD overwhelmed, but still I'm never quite sure how to reply to it all
9/12/19, 4:47 AM - Caleb: Idk I guess here's my shot though:
9/12/19, 4:47 AM - Caleb: I'm very very happy you had a good night, and I'm very very sorry you have to be up early tomorrow
9/12/19, 4:47 AM - Caleb: But hey it's all good because it's almost the weekend!
9/12/19, 4:49 AM - Caleb: I absolutely can't wait for you to be in Copenhagen, and also I know I seemed stressed about it, but I'm also so INCREDIBLY excited to visit you in Budapest
9/12/19, 4:50 AM - Caleb: I wasn't lying when I said it was my ideal break
9/12/19, 4:50 AM - Caleb: I don't think there's a whole lot that I'd rather do more than spend it with you there, and I just need to remind myself that one way or another the logistics will work out :)
9/12/19, 4:59 AM - Caleb: (also you had a few typos but you're still doing great so it's ok)
9/12/19, 5:00 AM - Caleb: But anyway good morning! Good luck with class!
9/12/19, 7:20 AM - Marianna: Morning
9/12/19, 7:20 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not a good one it‚Äôs just one
9/12/19, 7:20 AM - Marianna: I need WATER
9/12/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: Yeah I never know how to respond to drunken texts either
9/12/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: But hey at least you didn‚Äôt just shoot me back a ‚Äúk‚Äù
9/12/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: Appreciate that big time
9/12/19, 7:23 AM - Marianna: Well I only have one class so I will 100% just be coming back and napping at noon and then maybe I‚Äôll do some homework
9/12/19, 7:23 AM - Marianna: I hope you‚Äôre back asleep on a bus somewhere rn
9/12/19, 8:01 AM - Caleb: Ha
9/12/19, 8:01 AM - Caleb: No problem
9/12/19, 8:02 AM - Caleb: I think my texts when I'm drunk and when I'm super tired are surprisingly similar honestly
9/12/19, 8:02 AM - Caleb: The biggest difference is typos
9/12/19, 8:02 AM - Caleb: And oh you know it boyo
9/12/19, 8:02 AM - Caleb: I've been passed out for like an hour and a half
9/12/19, 8:03 AM - Caleb: Only waking up because there are some songs on my Spotify discover that I really liked and wanted to save
9/12/19, 8:03 AM - Caleb: Now we're at a gas station somewhere in the middle of Denmark
9/12/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Same
9/12/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: I also sound and do drunk things when I‚Äôm tired
9/12/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Or just normally sometimes
9/12/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm proud of you for sleeping
9/12/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Sarah and I are sleepdeprived and have some matching headaches
9/12/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Woooooo
9/12/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Where are you all going again?
9/12/19, 9:27 AM - Caleb: We're going to Aarhus
9/12/19, 9:27 AM - Caleb: We should be there in about 20 minutes
9/12/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: And oh no! Get water, get carbs, get advil
9/12/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: The holy trinity of hangovers
9/12/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Besides commons brunch
9/12/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: That's like the all-in-one deal
9/12/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: They should just pass out advil on Sunday mornings at commons
9/12/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Oh!  So everyone goes the same place!
9/12/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Margaux sent pictures and posted a bunch and it looked so cute
9/12/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: Oh. I could go for some carbs
9/12/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: AH miss commons
9/12/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: Joey sent me a snap from commons
9/12/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: And I realized I‚Äôm happier being here than there rn which is a pretty good realization
9/12/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: Sarah came to me this morning and was like ‚ÄúMAR do yOu HaVe aDViL‚Äù
9/12/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: I don't think _all_ people are going here
9/12/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: It's just a center of industry in Denmark, so most are
9/12/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: And yeah that probably is a good realization
9/12/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: Also, we're at the campus of Vestas, which is the largest windmill manufacturer in the world, and this place is absolutely beautiful
9/12/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: Oh well I know marion and Margaux did
9/12/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: Huh like old fashioned windmills
9/12/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: ?^
9/12/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: Or like modern wind turbines?
9/12/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: And is the campus just absolutely covered in them?  Is it like a showcase for people to see before they buy them?
9/12/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Also how is this related to artificial neural networks ?
9/12/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Sorry I‚Äôm asking lots of questions I‚Äôm genuinely puzzled by this it sounds so unique
9/12/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm walking back to the train and it is SUCH a beautiful day out
9/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Oh like wind turbines
9/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Idk why they call them windmills
9/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: And no! It's actually not
9/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: It's just really beautiful though
9/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Really cool architecture and art
9/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: And there's a couple ways it's related to NNs
9/12/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: I needed to pee for like half the presentation so I didn't get as much as I should have
9/12/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: But it's a lot of weather prediction, and efficiency modeling, and anomaly detection stuff
9/12/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: It was actually super interesting
9/12/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: But then people get into too technical of questions and I was just desperate for a bathroom
9/12/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: How was class?
9/12/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: Ah so super smart wind turbines
9/12/19, 12:20 PM - Marianna: Probably smarter than I
9/12/19, 12:20 PM - Marianna: Class was good!  I was excited to get the homework
9/12/19, 12:20 PM - Marianna: Which is weird
9/12/19, 12:20 PM - Marianna: But good I guess
9/12/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: Although I‚Äôm seriously starting to think the B section of theory of comp is not for me
9/12/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: People don‚Äôt catch on so fast
9/12/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: And the teacher is like pulling teeth
9/12/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want to ask AIT about it
9/12/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: Because I want to be in Sarah‚Äôs class and I don‚Äôt know for sure she‚Äôs the one that pulled me down into B like I felt good about that test but I know I‚Äôm not a discrete math person so maybe I just thought I did well or just more people did better
9/12/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: I think I should talk to Sarah about it
9/12/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: But even if she says it‚Äôs okay I feel like it‚Äôs gonna insult her or upset her
9/12/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: But you don‚Äôt have to worry about it it‚Äôs a me problem I just don‚Äôt know what to do
9/12/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Do you think that Sarah would be fine in A? Maybe you could talk to the professor and explain the situation
9/12/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: I'm sure she would totally understand, and maybe you both could transfer to the other class
9/12/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: I feel like maybe it would be a good call to talk to Sarah after you talk to the professor
9/12/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: And worst case scenario is that she offers to transfer you to the other class, and then you can decline and say you want to stay with Sarah
9/12/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: ...but I‚Äôd be fine if I was in a and Sarah was in b
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: Is that awful
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: No, I don't think that's awful
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: I think that's totally understandable
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: Like obviously I would rather take a class with her but we‚Äôd still have the same homework and could still work together
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think she wants b
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: I mean I don‚Äôt think she wants a
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Ahhh
9/12/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: But I also can‚Äôt assume she‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm in b
9/12/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: This is your only class with her?
9/12/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: Maybe my test score put me there and then I‚Äôd feel awkward asking
9/12/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: I'd just ask what she thinks of the class
9/12/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: I feel like that's a pretty benign question
9/12/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: But I sit in that class, and yeah I don‚Äôt have all the answers to what the prof asks but I at least understand the first time he explains things
9/12/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want to make her doubt herself or make her think I‚Äôm doubting her
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think you can avoid that
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Like people can act like it doesn‚Äôt affect them but I would take that as a serious insult if someone was like actually I think I‚Äôm gonna do the faster class
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Don't approach it with the goal of expressing your grievances, I'd approach it with just wanting to hear what she thinks
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Idk it‚Äôs stressful
9/12/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Then you can offer what you think in response to what she says
9/12/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: Me head hurts I think I‚Äôm gonna sleep
9/12/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I have faith, it'll all be fine
9/12/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: This won't get in the way of your friendship
9/12/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: But no offense you don‚Äôt know her I‚Äôm really worried she‚Äôs gonna take this the wrong way even if I ask a seemingly innocent question, she‚Äôs gonna know why I‚Äôm asking
9/12/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: Ah, yeah that's totally fair
9/12/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: I don't know her, but I know you guys are good enough friends to not let this be the end-all of your relationship
9/12/19, 12:40 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs had it a little rough with some friend doubts and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm gonna say but I need her to know she has me but this is gonna send the opposite message
9/12/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: Like I said, I'd just ask what she thinks about classes so far, and then take some time to gage where she's at with that one
9/12/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: Yeah but I don‚Äôt even want to hurt her a little but here
9/12/19, 12:41 PM - Caleb: It's not going to look sus because it's a class you share, so it naturally would be the most easy to talk about
9/12/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôll do that and see what happens at dinner tonight
9/12/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll talk to a friend in A and see what he thinks
9/12/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: We also have another friend in B she sits next to
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Okay I should try to sleep
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Don't worry, one way or another it'll all be okay
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Yeah that sounds like a good call
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt worry about this and have fun today!  I‚Äôll talk to ya when I join the waking world again
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Sleep fixes LOTS of things!
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Okay, sounds good
9/12/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: I'll be at a defence contracting company anyway so I won't have my phone
9/12/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: Oh wow so much sleep
9/12/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: Potentially too much
9/12/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: Oh you know just casually at a defense contractor
9/12/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: Well you know
9/12/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: Great minds
9/12/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: I obviously planned my naps around you being there and not having your phone
9/12/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Oh obviously obviously
9/12/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: But yeah it was an odd experience, very interesting but mostly on a manufacturing scale
9/12/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: My professor said that it was cool to see because there's a LOT of room for machine learning in this industry, and we saw it was underutilized
9/12/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: I think he used the phrase "low hanging fruit"
9/12/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: And I'm just like okay Ulf, sounds unethical but okay
9/12/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Why would it be unethical?
9/12/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Because they make parts for unguided missiles, and other weapons that fall under the umbrella of "defense spending"
9/12/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I don‚Äôt want an air controlling that
9/12/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: And I feel like if you're going to take a life, it should be the burden of a person and not a machine
9/12/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: Speaking of which, I have another book for you
9/12/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a long one
9/12/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Oh? I've got two books on queue right now but I'll take a look
9/12/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs sci fi/has some made up tech and science but is interesting
9/12/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Also coincidentally illustrated by Marie lu
9/12/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs called the illuminae files
9/12/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: I have a paperback copy at home and I‚Äôve been reading it on my kindle but I actually wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it on kindle because you lose some of the ambience of it because the pages are all designed and cool
9/12/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: So maybe not for now but I can get my copy to you when we‚Äôre back in the states
9/12/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Awesome! Thanks, if I can snag your copy I'll totally check it out
9/12/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Also, I think I'm getting sick :(
9/12/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: No!
9/12/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: :(
9/12/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
9/12/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: This is probably not the best time to get sick
9/12/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Being sick at all isn‚Äôt fun but I hope it doesn‚Äôt get too bad until you get back to your own bed if it has to get bad
9/12/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Yeah right now it's congestion and a scratchy throat
9/12/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: So worst case scenario I think would be a cold
9/12/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: But still not fun
9/12/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Also we just got to our hotel
9/12/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Wanna see something comical?
9/12/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Still not fun :(
9/12/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: And yes!
9/12/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: In what world would I say no
9/12/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Well I guess if I even do say no, there is probably something wrong
9/12/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: So YES
9/12/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/12/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: "sleep cheap in luxury"
9/12/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Oh well that looks cozy
9/12/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Got and Nathan are really gonna know each other in 3 days
9/12/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Would I help if I said it could be worse?
9/12/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: That's the whole space lol
9/12/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: I took that standing in the doorway
9/12/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: Also the roommates were random! It just happened that way lol
9/12/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs crazy
9/12/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: And no it probably wouldn't help, but also it's honestly not bad and I'm not upset
9/12/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: It's just tiny
9/12/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Hi you do remember how my apartment was this summer right
9/12/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Hi yes I do
9/12/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: And gotta say, it was cozy
9/12/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: I mean there has to be some statistical problem here for the chances you get a davidson pair given how many davidson kids there are there
9/12/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Cozy for multiple reasons
9/12/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: But cozy
9/12/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: But I guess how many are in your class?
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Yeah I liked my corner room
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: You never had to sleep in the main room
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: 19 in my class
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Still low odds
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Also, no no I didn't have to sleep in the main room
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Thank goodness
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: like in the neural networks class?
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/12/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs actually crazy
9/12/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: Also, the room is about half the size of my Philly room
9/12/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: I would feel like I‚Äôm still in a davidson class
9/12/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/12/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: So shush I know tiny
9/12/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs a good point
9/12/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: But your closet was also cozy
9/12/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/12/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: Thank you I suppose
9/12/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think my main qualm here is that my room has no personality and is tiny
9/12/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Tiny can be cozy, but it's just cramped here
9/12/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: But honestly, again, not bad
9/12/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Room in hotel or back with Reid?
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: You and Reid should go get some white girl tapestries or something
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: My room is quite big
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Not to brag
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: But it too doesn‚Äôt have a lot of personality
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: It does still have a dying basil plant
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Idk what to do about that
9/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: But I taped maps to one wall and I‚Äôve got my photos on the other
9/12/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not like my davidson rooms where I totally make the space my own
9/12/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Yeah my room is kinda roomy too
9/12/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Pardon the pun l
9/12/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: But yeah mine doesn't have any personality either
9/12/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: First I don't want to drop cash on fun decorations and not be able to bring it back with me
9/12/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: It just feels like a waste of money
9/12/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: And second, it's just a lot of work and investment in a space that's only mine for like 3 more months
9/12/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: So sorry when you come and it won't be cute, but hey maybe we will end up buying a white girl tapestry after all
9/12/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Yeah exactly
9/12/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not going to get string lights and other stuff
9/12/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: I did buy a blanket
9/12/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: And it will be fine
9/12/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: I probably will not care about how your room looks when i get there
9/12/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: Ah well me too
9/12/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: So it's fine
9/12/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: We can share my fuzzy blanket and it'll all be good
9/12/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Either that or I'm sure you could snag Reid's bed üòÅ
9/12/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Okay update, all the crossing sign guys here are little vikings
9/12/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: It's adorable
9/12/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: They have tiny axes and tell you to go
9/12/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm sure Reid won‚Äôt mind
9/12/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Maybe that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll tell judy
9/12/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: And that is so adorable
9/12/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Is that all of Denmark or just arhaus
9/12/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: Just √Örhus
9/12/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: Super cute
9/12/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: I'll grab a pic when I have a chance
9/12/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: Also hey hey guess what I just ate
9/12/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Shawarma
9/12/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Also convo with Sarah went a little worse than planned
9/12/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: She always wants to go to A
9/12/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But A is already a bigger class so I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll move us both up
9/12/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: So we‚Äôre gonna talk with the school tomorrow and be like what can we do
9/12/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs gonna be awkward if they say one of ya can
9/12/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Us**
9/12/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Also we‚Äôre both math majors and have taken multiple proof classes we SHOULD be in the advanced one
9/12/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Testing our memory of proofs we haven‚Äôt written in a year or more doesn‚Äôt show if we know proofs like we might need a refresher but we‚Äôve done this stuff so much before
9/12/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Wait that's a little worse than planned? Doesn't sound too bad
9/12/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Was she hurt at all?
9/12/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Also, I feel like you should be able to get moved up
9/12/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Like I said, it'll all work out
9/12/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: One way or another
9/12/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Also, kangaroo!
9/12/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: I think she was a little hurt
9/12/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: Mostly because I think she knows I probably did better on the test because she didn‚Äôt feel as good about it
9/12/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: But anyway
9/12/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: TINDER DATE IS HAPPENING
9/12/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: So robin and I are gonna go get drinks and be Sarah‚Äôs safety blanket
9/12/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: And woah I didn‚Äôt know they had kangaroos in Denmark
9/12/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: How was it?
9/12/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: I... I don't think they do have kangaroos in Denmark
9/12/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Also WOAH how's the date!
9/12/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Thoughts on him?
9/12/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Also we were doing an escape room! We figured it out!
9/12/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Oh and also the kangaroo was a bit chewy, but it might have just been overcooked
9/12/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: We haven‚Äôt met him
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre following Sarah but we lost her because they took the metro and she‚Äôs not being too helpful in us finding her
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Oh?
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: So robin and I are mostly walking
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Oh!  I love escape rooms
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Where were they going?
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Somewhere along the 4-6 tram route
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Does Sarah seem to be a fan?
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: But there are lots of bars
9/12/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Ohhhh so they haven't been to a bar yet
9/12/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: Caleb how would I be able to know that she hasn‚Äôt responded more than 2 sentences
9/12/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: They may be but we didn‚Äôt see them in any
9/12/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Idk, well if you think she'll be alright I guess
9/12/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I was under the impression they were meeting at the bar
9/12/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: Me too but he suggested meeting at the metro and walking there
9/12/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: I just texted her ‚Äúhey‚Äù
9/12/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: And she responded with a very helpful ‚Äúhi‚Äù
9/12/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Well keep me updated I guess
9/12/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Like if she doesn‚Äôt want to be found we could go home but it‚Äôs kind of annoying she‚Äôs not being responsive
9/12/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: :/
9/12/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah I can see that
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: And my find my friends isn‚Äôt working
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: Maybe you should just straight up ask her
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Should have done that before we left
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want him to see
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: I asked her to send her location
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: But also I feel like meeting a stranger, having them lose her friends, and then going to a bar is kinda sketchy
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: But also I'm now just vary weary of strangers
9/12/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah well he didn‚Äôt know we were following
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: We never saw him
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh okay
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: That's better
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Maybe
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I wouldn‚Äôt have been good with doing this but she seemed excited
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: And excuse me you love strangers
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Honestly not after that one night
9/12/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: I still like meeting people, but not being drunk around strangers
9/12/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah that‚Äôs a fair point
9/12/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: I never trust them
9/12/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Well, that's wise I suppose
9/12/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: I did
9/12/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Now I don't
9/12/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: But anyway, enough about that
9/12/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: How was your day!
9/12/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: I was gonna say good
9/12/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: But not great actually
9/12/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: And in Hungary when you ask how someone is it‚Äôs culturally accurate to be brutally honest
9/12/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Class annoyed me because it was slow
9/12/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Then I did nap
9/12/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Then finished my homework
9/12/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Yoga was good I guess
9/12/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: And I listened to music on my way there and I love just walking around and listening to music and being in my own world
9/12/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: May have danced a little on the metro
9/12/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: But now I‚Äôm sitting in a little park ticked off
9/12/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: This is not my ideal Thursday I think I‚Äôd like to be asleep rn
9/12/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: And whenever I end a day badly the whole day is a not good day
9/12/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: How was your day?
9/12/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Well
9/12/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Honestly thank you for your honesty
9/12/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I'd rather have that above all else
9/12/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Okay I think she shared her location with me but it didn‚Äôt notify me so we‚Äôre heading there now
9/12/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry to hear that though, tomorrow will be better
9/12/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Off days are definitely allowed
9/12/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Also you just reminded me of this thing called the "peak-to-end" phenomenon
9/12/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: I read about it in this book called "Being Mortal"
9/12/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: But anyway, it's basically that when looking back and remembering how we feel about something, we'll remember it most by how we felt from whatever the most intense moment was up until the end
9/12/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: So if you had a really shitty morning, then a great thing happens and you just kind of coast, you'll remember it as a good day
9/12/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: But if it's a great day and then right at the end something awful happens and it goes to the end, it'll be remembered as a shitty day
9/12/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Idk, just kind of interesting with what you said
9/12/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: And my days been pretty okay too honestly, it was super long and a lot of travel, and I don't feel great right now, but I had good company through everything so it can definitely be worse
9/12/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: I'm wiped though, 4am to now is definitely a rough amount of time to be awake and doing stuff
9/12/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Okay I'm actually going to bed, eyes are too heavy
9/12/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
9/12/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Hope it all gets better
9/12/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Okay we found them!  Now we‚Äôre drinking at the bar with them
9/12/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: M√°rk is inciting friends so we‚Äôll meet more Hungarians!!!
9/12/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Inviting!!
9/12/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs so interesting
9/12/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so accurate in my opinion
9/12/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: And okay goodnight!  I‚Äôll let you know how it all goes over here!
9/12/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Oh you‚Äôd be proud of me I had another gin and tonic
9/13/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Update robin and I just should not be alone together in budeapest
9/13/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Some guy walked up to us and put his arm around us both and was like hello
9/13/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: My response was ‚Äúuh no‚Äù and a cutting glare as robin and I stepped out of his reach
9/13/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: And then I was like robin why does this always happen
9/13/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: And some guy also on the street corner with us was like ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs karma‚Äù
9/13/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Like what the heck my man you really think we deserve being hit on or whatever you‚Äôd call that by random drunk guys?
9/13/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: But anyway I‚Äôm home safe now and Sarah and M√°rk are still walking around but it turned out a little good
9/13/19, 4:12 AM - Caleb: Oh man that's so unsettling, I'm so sorry Marianna
9/13/19, 4:12 AM - Caleb: That honestly sounds like a scary experience, I'm glad you and Robin are okay
9/13/19, 4:13 AM - Caleb: Do you have mace or something equivalent over there? Because it sounds like that might be an investment
9/13/19, 4:15 AM - Caleb: Other than that did your night end up being fun? Did you meet M√°rk's Hungarian friends?
9/13/19, 4:15 AM - Caleb: Oh and how did it end up going for Sarah?
9/13/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: Eh it gets to be less scary and more just like stop please I‚Äôd rather this not happen again. They‚Äôre just always drunk and usually take the no very well
9/13/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: But no we don‚Äôt have mace
9/13/19, 7:03 AM - Marianna: But we also were on like _THE_ main drag in Budapest so we were surrounded by people
9/13/19, 7:03 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs one comforting thing about this place. There are literally always people everywhere
9/13/19, 7:04 AM - Marianna: Well maybe not district 5 but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the more post district and it‚Äôs just quieter
9/13/19, 7:04 AM - Marianna: Nah we just went home I don‚Äôt think his friends ever made it out
9/13/19, 7:04 AM - Marianna: So robin and I were straight up just date crashing
9/13/19, 7:05 AM - Marianna: And idk she got back at like 2 so I haven‚Äôt talked with her yet
9/13/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: _she_ got back at 2, or _they_ got back at 2? ü§îü§îü§î
9/13/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: Jkjk yeah I'm curious how it went but also I don't know her and tbh it's not really my business
9/13/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: Oh and also good morning! I can't tell if I feel better or worse yet
9/13/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: All I know is I didn't sleep great and am tired as heck
9/13/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: Oh and I ate like a billion cough drops too
9/13/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: He wasn‚Äôt there when I woke up so I assume she got back at 2
9/13/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: I feel like this is a less likely situation to have random hookups
9/13/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: But idk
9/13/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Aw I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt sleep well
9/13/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: I never sleep well when I‚Äôm in a new place
9/13/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: Or when sick
9/13/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: And you got both last night
9/13/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: So I sorry :(
9/13/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: Eh yeah
9/13/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: The bed was kinda uncomfortable too
9/13/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: It was half the width of a twin bed
9/13/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: So I constantly felt like I was going to fall off
9/13/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: And you already know how I am with falling off beds
9/13/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: Oh man I just feel like I have a hangover
9/13/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: Is this what getting old feels like
9/13/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: I don't drink but still have hangovers?
9/13/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: Yeah you‚Äôre not the best at not falling out of beds
9/13/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I have at least in front of you yet
9/13/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: And no I think that‚Äôs just sleep deprivation
9/13/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: I always feel hungover when I don‚Äôt sleep enough
9/13/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt consider myself old
9/13/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: But hey you‚Äôre newly 21 so you ARE basically an old man now
9/13/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: Well
9/13/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: My brain also feels like it went through a blender
9/13/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: But still it's not too bad
9/13/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: How are you doing?
9/13/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: Oh! Also apparently we're going to a bunch of museums today and I'm super excited
9/13/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Oh no poor brain
9/13/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm doing good
9/13/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm in the comp bio class
9/13/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I think its gonna be my favorite
9/13/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: And yay!  Have fun at museums!
9/13/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Museums are a great Friday activity
9/13/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt actually been to any in Budapest yet
9/13/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Sarah and I are gonna create like a jar of places around Budapest to pull from to choose random places to go on our weekends
9/13/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Oooooooo
9/13/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: That's an awesome idea
9/13/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: I've done something like that once
9/13/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: But it was popsicle sticks, and each one has a painted tip
9/13/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: And the colors correspond to the price of it, so if you're feeling cheap it's easy
9/13/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs so clever
9/13/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Most stuff is pretty free or cheap here
9/13/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Especially most of the stuff on our list to do so far
9/13/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/13/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Oof that looks delicious
9/13/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/13/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: (it was Pad Thai)
9/13/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like of Thai
9/13/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Pad**
9/13/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: I really only eat chinese food and not much other Asian food
9/13/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: My food group are pretty much Italian/french/Chinese/American
9/13/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: And now some Hungarian!
9/13/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Oooo Marianna we gotta expand your horizons
9/13/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: In an allergy-friendly way
9/13/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: We're at a street food place and there are soooooooo many good looking things
9/13/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Well most of what I eat is what I cook
9/13/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Also I avoid spicy food and noodles soooo
9/13/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: I just haven‚Äôt had great experiences with street food
9/13/19, 1:14 PM - Caleb: Oh really? As in like food poisoning?
9/13/19, 1:14 PM - Caleb: Or just wasn't good
9/13/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: This is a really clean, established place
9/13/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: It's like a warehouse that got converted
9/13/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: No just wasn‚Äôt good
9/13/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: I realize I‚Äôm pretty spoiled with what the people around me and what I can cook so eating out is only a convenience thing for me usually
9/13/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: But if I want someone from a food truck, I can probably make it myself so I would rather try it out I guess
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: And how many converted warehouses have you been to now?! It seems like a lot
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: WELL
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: You see
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: Are you all gonna go to the rainbow circle window place
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Copenhagen used to be a massive port city
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Which is how it got so huge
9/13/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Then in the 60s they wanted to rebrand, so they started converting shipping infrastructure to tourist attractions
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: And more local friendly stuff
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: So here we are
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: And oh you know it
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Well
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: I think it's actually the next thing on the agenda
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: That makes sense
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: I guess it‚Äôs your equivalent of ruin bars
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: (Less fun maybe)
9/13/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Oh then you KNOW what you have to do
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: ?
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: What do I have to do
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: No one officially went to DIS until they post hipster ass photos from that colorful window place
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: And also yeah I guess that's a fair analogy
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Less cool though
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Oh God you're right
9/13/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: I have to avoid that
9/13/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I can't be a basic hipster
9/13/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I have to be the uber hipster
9/13/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Hipsters are too mainstream now
9/13/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: No you have to embrace it
9/13/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs admittedly a cool photo place
9/13/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: NEVER
9/13/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Also I've got a bunch of cool pictures now
9/13/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Get some good new profile pictures
9/13/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Hope you wore a good photogenic outfit
9/13/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Did the koi shirt get ruined by the wine the other weekend?
9/13/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: Woo and I keep swapping cameras so we finally have good pictures of ourselves
9/13/19, 1:29 PM - Caleb: And nope it's fine
9/13/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: The koi shirt lives on
9/13/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: It's just a little cold for it
9/13/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/13/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: Oh my word
9/13/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/13/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: There's a statue in this museum
9/13/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: It's a statue of a person dressed up like a performance artist imitating a statue
9/13/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/13/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs so good!!
9/13/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: And yay for the koi shirt
9/13/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a fun and good shirt
9/13/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah you‚Äôre gonna have to tell us what we should pack to prepare for Copenhagen when that gets closer
9/13/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs meta?
9/13/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs actually a statue?
9/13/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: Not a person looking like a statue?
9/13/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/13/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: It's a statue that looks like a person who looks like a statue
9/13/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: I think
9/13/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Or maybe it's deeper!
9/13/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Maybe it's a person who wants to look like a statue that looks like a person dressed like a statue!
9/13/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Also, my memory card ran out in the museum
9/13/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: So I'm now sitting on a bench, putting it onto my laptop
9/13/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Woah
9/13/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Sorry can‚Äôt comprehend!
9/13/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Try again later!
9/13/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Brain not working
9/13/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Well at least you can do that
9/13/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt you just empty it?
9/13/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Are you shooting raw or have you just taken that many?
9/13/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: For some reason even though I deleted the pictures, the memory was still allocated
9/13/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: So I coped the flies and then hard formatted and now we're good
9/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: #memoryleak?
9/13/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: Also hey you made it to the to the weekend!
9/13/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Yes!
9/13/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm planning on going home, eating some kind of junk food, watching Netflix, and maybe sleeping before rallying and cleaning the apt before pregame tonight
9/13/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Wooohoo!
9/13/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Sounds like a good night
9/13/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Anything after the pregame?
9/13/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm at this really really cool botanical garden right now
9/13/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: But it said no pictures :(
9/13/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/13/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  Maybe karaoke or another bar we‚Äôve wanted to go to but it‚Äôs always been pretty empty but it‚Äôs their 1 year bday party tonight so we‚Äôre hoping there will be more people
9/13/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: Oh so pretty
9/13/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: Low key that picture just really calmed me down
9/13/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs so much warmer in the city than on campus it‚Äôs actually crazy
9/13/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: OH MY LORD

9/13/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: What have you covered so far in comp bio? Do you know what type of stuff you'll study?
9/13/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Just basic intro stuff like what is dna
9/13/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: But crash course style
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: WHAT
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: IS
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: DNA

9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: AND THEN THERE ARE REPRESSIRS
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: AND ACTIVATORS
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: AND GENES
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: We don't like it when it does that
9/13/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: AND HISTONES
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: BUT IT DOES AND WE CANT STOP IT

9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Cool
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: That's fairly in depth
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: And how do we stop that?
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: the guys the dna wraps its stuff around
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Ahaha yeah I know what they are
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: Idk man

9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs cool
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: You just typically don't learn about stuff like that in a crash course
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Yeah yeah it is
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: It's all very cool
9/13/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: I'm proud

9/13/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: One of my most prized memories from high school
9/13/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Loved my bio class and teacher and lab sessions more than anything
9/13/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I need to email him to tell him I‚Äôm doing bio again (or very very little bio again)
9/13/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: But we saw a codon chart today
9/13/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: That's good
9/13/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: I was the same way

9/13/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Just like random, important to know things?
9/13/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Not that I think of?
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know who did that
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Which one was the teacher that taught you guys very valuable life lessons
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Oh are you thinking of my religion prof?
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: She got fired
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: YEAH
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: I think that's the one
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Stausbough!
9/13/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Such a great little old lady
9/13/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Yepyepyep
9/13/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: So this was a different one though
9/13/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Yeah mr peri was like all of our fathers
9/13/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Like he‚Äôs the best
9/13/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Awwwww
9/13/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Those people man
9/13/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: They touch our lives in so many ways
9/13/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/13/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: There's 0 chance I'd be where I am without one teacher
9/13/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: We wrote him a song to thank him
9/13/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah you told me about that!
9/13/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: And it's odd because it's partly because he wrote an incredible letter of recommendation
9/13/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah Mr. Kindt
9/13/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: OH MY GOSH I WAS TRYINF TO FIND THE CIDEO OF US SINGINF AND SMFOUND SO MANY OF ME IN HIGHSCHOOL
9/13/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: OH NO
9/13/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: OH YES
9/13/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: OHHHHHHHH YES
9/13/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/13/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Uh
9/13/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: I'm going to need some of those
9/13/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Never
9/13/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Jk we can watch them together
9/13/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Oh god
9/13/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre so awful
9/13/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Oh that's beautiful
9/13/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: I'm already so excited
9/13/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: You will probably find them very boring
9/13/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah! We also need to figure out when I'm coming to Budapest
9/13/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: Lots of school projects
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: I got an accurate schedule for the conference so I need to take a look at that
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah!
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Oh good!
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Idk, I'd still love to come earlier but also it's like ehhhhh I seriously seriously don't want to impose
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Still need to be in China on the 13th
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Either on your or Sarah
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Idk I haven't taken a very good look at it
9/13/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs fine
9/13/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Okay honestly I‚Äôd be fine with you all week I just don‚Äôt want to steal your break
9/13/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: So I was thinking and you‚Äôd be welcome that first weekend and then if you wanted to go to Prague or Croatia or somewhere else close-ish, youcould monday-Wednesday because those will probably be the most boring days
9/13/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Or you could just explore Budapest
9/13/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: I really think there is so much to do here you wouldn‚Äôt get bored
9/13/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Also have you seen the Robert Downey jr Sherlock films
9/13/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: And I know you said you wanted to hear why I wanted but I genuinely am fine with whatever works best for you as long as I can maybe see you too but I also would absolutely LOVE to show you my world here and I‚Äôve already got some ideas of where to take you and stuff
9/13/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Sorry sorry phone died and I just got back
9/13/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Aldrich got us lost
9/13/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/13/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Yes I have seen those films
9/13/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: One at least
9/13/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: The first one I think
9/13/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: And yeah I get what you're saying, but the thing is that planning other things would be hard
9/13/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Everyone is basically planning full break trips together, so it's not exactly like I could just say "oh I'll be there for like 3 days and I'm bouncing"
9/13/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Well, actually I could
9/13/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: But honestly I'd have the most fun with you in Budapest
9/13/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Also, I had the exact same idea!
9/13/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: You mentioned Prague and Croatia and those are absolutely places I've always wanted to go
9/13/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: So if you invite me to come the first weekend and stay the week I'd be delighted to
9/13/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: Under the conditions that: 1) its actually what you really want, 2) Sarah's okay with it, and 3) you still get done homework and everything you need to do
9/13/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: I don't want you to be _TOO_ distracting :)
9/13/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: Also I don't just want to invite myself and put you in the uncomfortable spot of needing to give a clear yes or no, because it feels sorta like that's what I'm doing
9/13/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: I promise you can say no or suggest something else and I absolutely won't be hurt, the worst thing I'd want to do is put you in an awkward spot where you can't say no but don't want to say yes
9/13/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: I think my ideal would be you come fri-sun so you have a weekend here, you go somewhere else mon-wed because I‚Äôll have the most class and can do my work then, and then you come back Wednesday night or Thursday so we can do touristy stuff Thursday afternoon and you fly to China Saturday?
9/13/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Hey, if thats a formal invitation, I'll take it :)
9/13/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Just let me know if Sarah says that's good
9/13/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: And after that I'll book the flight
9/13/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: So! How's the pregame/karaoke?
9/13/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: I know you _want_ to come to Budapest but honestly it‚Äôs a new thing for people to want to visit me so I‚Äôm okay it‚Äôs just strange for me so I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm being weird about it
9/13/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: To be perfectly honest
9/13/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: But I do WANT you to come so I‚Äôm good with it
9/13/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: And Sarah is good with it
9/13/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Oh really? Yeah okay that makes a sense I guess
9/13/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Well if you have any questions or there's anything I can do to make you feel better, let me know
9/13/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: And I promise that as long as I'm there with you, I'll be absolutely happy and content
9/13/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: So don't stress about needing to find things to do or me bring bored, I'll have a great time no matter what
9/13/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk I can explain it at some point but it‚Äôs not a weird thing it‚Äôs just a different thing idk idk what it is
9/13/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: But it makes me happy that you‚Äôll be happy and content here!
9/13/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm not that stressed about it because I have a list of thing that would be fun with you!!
9/13/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: And pregame is good
9/13/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: There is only one problem
9/13/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: The guys brought tequila
9/13/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Well
9/13/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Woo just vomited
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: We finished a bottle of vodka between the four of us
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Uhhhhhh
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: This is unfortunate
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: You okay?
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm fine
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm so sorry
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: OH woo
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Got it
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: I thought it was a sarcastic woooo as in woot
9/13/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/13/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Friend Woo
9/13/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Not me
9/13/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I would not say woo to that
9/13/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I feel heavy tipsy at most
9/13/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs why I thought it was sarcastic
9/13/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: And wait OH NO TEQUILA
9/13/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: I hope the clothes don't fall off for anyone
9/13/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: **nervous laughter**
9/13/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Nah I‚Äôll do my best
9/13/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Ah your best
9/13/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Thank you thank you
9/13/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: And the song doesn‚Äôt say for ANYONE it‚Äôs just in general
9/13/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Last time I kept my clothes on I just cried :)
9/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: :(
9/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: :((
9/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Well I hope that doesn't happen for you
9/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: I hope you stay clothed and happy
9/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Unless you sleep naked in which case that's fun every once in a while
9/13/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: But anyway
9/13/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Only when I‚Äôm drunk usually and that‚Äôs just when I genuinely forget to put pjs on whoops
9/13/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Anyway
9/13/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Hey man

9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: It's fun because ulf is great
9/13/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: It would be weirder if he wasn't almost our age

9/14/19, 7:05 AM - Caleb: HEYY that's awesome to hear, good on them

9/14/19, 7:06 AM - Caleb: As you already know, I'm very easily persuaded to doing things I already want to do
9/14/19, 7:06 AM - Caleb: And awwwwww, I'm glad you had a good night, and I hope your morning isn't too rough
9/14/19, 7:31 AM - Marianna: Oh what was going on at 6am this morning in female?

9/14/19, 7:32 AM - Caleb: How ya feeling
9/14/19, 7:32 AM - Marianna: Oh! Well that is infinitely better than staying in bed and just feeling annoyed that you can‚Äôt sleep
9/14/19, 7:33 AM - Marianna: And eh very tired and I can feel the hangover but haven‚Äôt tried to get vertical yet
9/14/19, 7:33 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna last this day

9/14/19, 7:47 AM - Marianna: Like horseback riding and stuff

9/14/19, 7:49 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs optional but why not
9/14/19, 7:49 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been on horses before
9/14/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: Oh my word
9/14/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: Wait
9/14/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: Does this make you a horse girl
9/14/19, 7:50 AM - Marianna: Ah heck no
9/14/19, 7:50 AM - Marianna: Let me clarify
9/14/19, 7:51 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve Ben on horse maybe twice before
9/14/19, 7:51 AM - Marianna: And could tell you nothing about horses
9/14/19, 7:51 AM - Marianna: And have never ever posted about my horses on an social media platform
9/14/19, 7:51 AM - Marianna: Also should I wake sarah up?  Idk when or if she set her alarms

9/14/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Not really
9/14/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: My theory is I learned them at the same time
9/14/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: Like you know how you learn letters in chunks of the alphabet
9/14/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôll replace ms with ps and vice versa in both writing and typing
9/14/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: Woah
9/14/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: That's super interesting

9/14/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: And then a bunch of little Danish kids started coming over and playing with it
9/14/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: It's the seal of approval
9/14/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: I'm so happy right now
9/14/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: You should drop bioinformatics and take up engineering
9/14/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not too late for the 3-2 program

9/14/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: I just want to play with Legos
9/14/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: Which I can still drop out and do!
9/14/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: Jkjk, it just makes me really look forward to when I have kids and I totally have an excuse to do this again

9/14/19, 11:46 AM - Marianna: I used to love putting legos together
9/14/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Our staff from school brought their families and it‚Äôs all so adorable

9/14/19, 11:51 AM - Caleb: It was a school activity üò≠
9/14/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Also they are making goulash in the original style like big open pot  and it smells so good and I was like woah it smells like scallopini (dish i make but Nonna makes better) but it can‚Äôt be but then I realized it‚Äôs the ROSEMARY
9/14/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: wait what was a school activity?
9/14/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: The building Legos with your school staff

9/14/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Honestly
9/14/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: I miss being a kid now

9/14/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Each piece corresponds to an item on the menu
9/14/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: So you put together the pieces you want, and it scans it and makes it for you
9/14/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: I LOVE THAT
9/14/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: WE'RE LIVING IN THE FUTURE

9/14/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Good STUFF
9/14/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: You think you would actually want to work for Lego?
9/14/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Am I witnessing a career shift?
9/14/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: I honestly dont think I have the creativity anymore to work for Lego
9/14/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôd still want to do tech stuff for them
9/14/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: But I like companies that are fun and cutting edge and creative and innovative
9/14/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: I wouldnt want to work at like Sony or something
9/14/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Even Microsoft is a tad bit boring to me
9/14/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Not that I can be very picky or anything
9/14/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: And just think
9/14/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: You'd bring joy to so many children
9/14/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: It'd be wonderful
9/14/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: It would be
9/14/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs rather work at Disney though
9/14/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Sorry I haven‚Äôt been to responsive my phones almost dead so I‚Äôm trying not to use it

9/14/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: Oh hey no worries

9/14/19, 4:53 PM - Caleb: And yeah! Definitely!

9/14/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: We can call tonight if you want
9/14/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: I'm so wiped right now that I just honestly want to spend it in

9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Hey! Welcome back
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Got to really just enjoy the moment of being on the ranch
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Hey!
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: That sounds incredibly long
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: I always love unplugging
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: It's what I always do when I hike
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah it was nice
9/14/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm also still a bit intoxicated
9/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Because man they are a fan of the drink in this country
9/14/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Did you guys go anywhere after the ranch?
9/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: But oh the food was so good today
9/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: No
9/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: We stayed for sunset and then stargazed
9/14/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Waif did you JUST get back from the ranch? Like that was the whole day?

9/14/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Did you get a good nap?
9/14/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Eh not really
9/14/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: I just ended up putting photos on drop box
9/14/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: And unpacking my stuff
9/14/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: So it needed to be done
9/14/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: And also I don't want to ruin my sleep tonight
9/14/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Nice to be back in your own room and bed?
9/14/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Did Reid miss you too much?
9/14/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Aha
9/14/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Reid actually had some friends visiting from London
9/14/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: So he's been occupied with them
9/14/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: So I'm sure he didn't miss me _too_ much
9/14/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: How was your day! I want to hear all about it
9/14/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Oh well you don‚Äôt know he didn‚Äôt
9/14/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Call or are you too tired?
9/14/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Because I can do the short answer to how my day was but I don‚Äôt think I can type out how great my day was
9/14/19, 9:53 PM - Caleb: What time would you want to call?
9/14/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Now?  I‚Äôm probably gonna need to sleep soon but I want to get photos off and look through them so I‚Äôll be awak as long as that takes me
9/14/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: 5 minutes?
9/14/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: I need to get back to my room
9/14/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Works with me
9/14/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Unless I literally pass out
9/14/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs not too likely
9/14/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: So it should be fine
9/14/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Is it okay if I shower and get comfy really quickly?
9/14/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: Yes but I really can‚Äôt promise I‚Äôll be awake
9/14/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to talk to you I do I just feel my body calling it quits
9/14/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not a big deal if we don‚Äôt talk tongiht
9/14/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Oh I also want photos from your trip please!  And if it doesn‚Äôt contain some from the rainbow contraption I‚Äôm not talking to you for a week
9/14/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
9/14/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Wait wait wai

9/14/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
9/14/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: You're welcome to leave a sassy comment about it if you want
9/14/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: But otherwise I _may_ need to refer you to my lawyer
9/14/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Which I now realize is still just you
9/15/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Well
9/15/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Good morning
9/15/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Happy Sunday, I got locked out of my apartment with no shoes
9/15/19, 10:29 AM - Caleb: Currently waiting for flatmates to wake up
9/15/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Update: all is well
9/15/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: Nah I settle my petty arguments like this one on one not on instragm
9/15/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll have my lawyer talk to your lawyer and see if we can come to. Settlement
9/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: And oof
9/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: Well that was a dumb move to leave with no keys and no shoes?
9/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: At least you weren‚Äôt in your towel
9/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: Audrey and I have done that
9/15/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre all good now
9/15/19, 11:14 AM - Caleb: Ah fair enough
9/15/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: Good thing I have Instagram malpractice insurance
9/15/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: And oh yeah, I was stepping like one foot out of my door to the trash chute, and figured I could just keep the door cracked
9/15/19, 11:16 AM - Caleb: And I accidentally closed it harder than intended
9/15/19, 11:16 AM - Caleb: But hey all is well
9/15/19, 11:16 AM - Caleb: Okay, I have a random question, and sorry if this is too much for this early on a Sunday
9/15/19, 11:17 AM - Caleb: Do you ever have envy of people who studied abroad other countries? Like, do you ever feel a little bit of regret of where you picked?
9/15/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: Oh okay that‚Äôs a classic situation I‚Äôm sorry it happened to you but good you got back in
9/15/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: And well kind of
9/15/19, 11:28 AM - Marianna: Hungary has been a dream like beats every expectation I had
9/15/19, 11:29 AM - Marianna: BUT I still wish I had been able to find a program in Italy
9/15/19, 11:29 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm a little bummed I can‚Äôt even visit Italy
9/15/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: Are you feeling like that right now?
9/15/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Honestly
9/15/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Yeah a little bit
9/15/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: I feel trapped and kind of regret not exploring more options
9/15/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: And Copenhagen is cool for a bit, but I'm definitely not in love with it
9/15/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Not yet at least
9/15/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: It feels sort of like I went to the "state school" of studying abroad, and I feel like somewhere out there, there's a Davidson that I didn't bother looking at
9/15/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Oh hey also, before I book flights on student Universe, do you want to give me a referral code of something
9/15/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: what email do you want me to send the referral to?
9/15/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: And yeah but honestly form my perspective (and I guess that is seeing the highlights of your, Marion‚Äôs, and Margaux‚Äôs experiences), it seems like you all are doing much cooler things than us
9/15/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: So I think it might be a grass is always greener thing
9/15/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: And idk I believe we all end up where we need to end up
9/15/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre thinking rn though
9/15/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: And plus, hate to say it but NZ is so isolated like when you‚Äôre there, it‚Äôs easy to see lots of NZ but no other countries
9/15/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre in the center of Europe
9/15/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: You can go WHEREVER
9/15/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: So go find your mountains
9/15/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Just sent it to my Davidson email
9/15/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: cagrenko@davidson.edu
9/15/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I guess I'm super prone to the "grass is always greener" issue
9/15/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: But the truth is that the grass is always greener where you water it
9/15/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: And I always forget that
9/15/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: But that's helpful to hear honestly, so thank you
9/15/19, 12:10 PM - Marianna: Okay sent it!
9/15/19, 12:11 PM - Marianna: Wow I‚Äôve heard that I like that so much
9/15/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm super prone to the greener on the other side thing
9/15/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: I like being where I am
9/15/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: Usually I do too
9/15/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: I think part of it right now is that I don't feel like I'm getting the most out of it
9/15/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: I've got to take an afternoon and just reflect
9/15/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Maybe that's what I'll do Wednesday
9/15/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Regroup my brain
9/15/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: Oh that sounds like a great Wednesday plan
9/15/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the plan for today?
9/15/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Well
9/15/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Currently I'm getting brunch with friends
9/15/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: It's like $11 for an all you can eat buffet
9/15/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Which for Copenhagen is dirt cheap so heyyyy
9/15/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: And it's Sunday, so obviously brunch
9/15/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Woah that sounds fun
9/15/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: And then I'm going to the CBS library to work because boy of boy did I neglect everything
9/15/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Oh me too
9/15/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: What about you? Sweet festival and then mass? Anything else?
9/15/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm still watching Netflix
9/15/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Homework and then all that stuff yeah
9/15/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: I should really start the homework though
9/15/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
9/15/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: THeY hAvE MaC aNd ChEesE
9/15/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: Oh man
9/15/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt had Mac and cheese in a WHILE
9/15/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: brunch was good I assume?  Was it mostly like European food or was it also a lot of American food?
9/15/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/15/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: Honestly they're pretty similar
9/15/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: At least Danish food is
9/15/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: There are oddities but mostly they eat similar things
9/15/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: Some just have a twist to them
9/15/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: The oddest stuff is mostly breakfast stuff and liverpaste
9/15/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Lots of stuff with elderflower
9/15/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Also it was good! Now we're heading to H&M
9/15/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: How's your morning? Still watching Netflix?
9/15/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: We had an elderflower mixed drink last week
9/15/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: Twas good
9/15/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: They don‚Äôt eat sweet things for breakfast
9/15/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: Here anyway
9/15/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird
9/15/19, 2:13 PM - Marianna: And in my experience Europe eats a lot of meats and cheeses and fruit and bread but they don‚Äôt do waffles or scrambled or fried eggs or anything
9/15/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah I've noticed that too
9/15/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Nothing is that sweet
9/15/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Even the candy
9/15/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOSH
9/15/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: When you're here, we need to buy liquorish
9/15/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: Its like the main candy people love here
9/15/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: And fl√∏dbolle
9/15/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: Which are actually delicious
9/15/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: They're like very fluffy mousse covered in thin chocolate
9/15/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm really not sure that‚Äôs how you spell licorice
9/15/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: You keep doing it like that so I might be wrong
9/15/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt particularly _like_ licorice however you spell it
9/15/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Fl√∏dbolle?
9/15/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/15/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Are there a lot of danishes in Denmark
9/15/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: ...not counting the people!
9/15/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Is there like a traditional dessert though?
9/15/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Oh I see you already said what fl√∏dbolle is
9/15/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: My b
9/15/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: We just went to the sweets festival
9/15/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Very cool
9/15/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: They had alcoholic ice cream
9/15/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Which Sarah and josh got
9/15/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm now sitting in church so I passed
9/15/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: I did try a chocolate bonbon that was just filled with palinka though
9/15/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: And I got a poppyseed macaron
9/15/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/15/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: Spelling
9/15/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: My strongest of strong suits
9/15/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: And yeah there are plenty of traditional deserts
9/15/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: There's fl√∏dbolle
9/15/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: Which I already told you about
9/15/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: OH OH OH
9/15/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: There's "Wednesday Snails"!
9/15/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Onsdag Snegle!
9/15/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: It's a cinnamon roll
9/15/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: But Wednesday and very big and very fresh
9/15/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Also √¶bleskiver
9/15/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Which are those filled mini pancakes
9/15/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: But you worked at Willams Sonoma so I don't need to tell you about those
9/15/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: And also that traditional cake which is basically pancakes and strawberry cream filling
9/15/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Works with me!!
9/15/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: I know I have picked up that you‚Äôre good at spelling
9/15/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: And sorry I was in church or I would have responded sooner
9/15/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Oh the strawberry pancake cake sounds so good
9/15/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: I expect a full tour of danish desserts while there
9/15/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Just saying
9/15/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Please pencil some time in firthaf
9/15/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: For that**
9/15/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: Oh no worries
9/15/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I'm sure I can pull some strings and make that happen :)
9/15/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: And don't worry about it, you're a busy gal
9/15/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Not an emergency anyway
9/15/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: How was church?
9/15/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Also you can't diss my spelling and then hit me with "firthaf"
9/15/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: That's not how this works
9/15/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: _firthaf..._
9/15/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Yay!  See you here!
9/15/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Church was good
9/15/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Was cornered for the third week to join the choir so I‚Äôm going to choir practice next week
9/15/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: And well that was an innocent typo as I was walking
9/15/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt actually think something was spelled like that
9/15/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: Sooooo
9/15/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
9/15/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Is the choir in Latin, English, or Hungarian
9/15/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: Because honestly any of those would be super cool
9/15/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: And I'm happy you're integrating well with the locals
9/15/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Oh but honestly with the spelling thing
9/15/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: I think it's getting worse the more I'm here
9/15/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: At least in handwriting
9/15/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: The more I write, the more I substitute odd letters
9/15/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: And it's funny because it's based off letter shape, not sound
9/15/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: So like I'll write a p instead of q
9/15/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Or b instead of g
9/15/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Or f instead of t
9/15/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: It's some preschool looking stuff
9/15/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Oh and the worst part is that I leave it in there because I'm like "yeah ill know what I mean"
9/15/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: And then other people ask to see my notes and it kills me
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: I just ate some good cheese
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: Thought you‚Äôd want to know
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: Cheese makes me happy
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs in English
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: I always want to know that
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Especially if it's Brie
9/15/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: So there‚Äôs an English speaking community that gets mass time at the basilica here which is just insanely cool
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs odd with the letters
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Warm Brie and honey is ambrosia
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Oh that's super cool
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: It was a Hungarian cheese
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Oh but that‚Äôs good
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Can we make that
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: With like warm puff pastry
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: U no it
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Your place or mine?
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Or
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Idk we might not have time in cope
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Bolth
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: But man will we have time in Budapest
9/15/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Oh shoot yeah that's fair
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: Also
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: Bolth works too
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: Also
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: Also
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs something you should know about me
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs confession time
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: I can go shopping for you if hole you're in class btw
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: While*
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: This has scared away many people in my life
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: I like cheese a lot
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: .... Oh?
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôll just buy a block of it
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: Ohkay
9/15/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: And then I‚Äôll just snap on the block
9/15/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: So if you get here and there are blocks of cheese with teeth marks
9/15/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: ...it was Sarah
9/15/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not a barbarian
9/15/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: It is just more efficient than slicing it
9/15/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: _If you are receiving this message, you have been blocked by the intended recipient._
9/15/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: _the most likely cause for this would be having teeth marks in cheese. If you believe this was an error, please contact WhatsApp support._
9/15/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: Hi WhatsApp support there‚Äôs been an error
9/15/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: _uh hello it is mr. whatsapp how may i help you_
9/15/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: A cute boy blocked me
9/15/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: I need your help
9/15/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Can you be my wingman and see if we can undo this?
9/15/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Tell him I have cool photos from my day yesterday I want to share with him
9/15/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs a sucker for that
9/15/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: _>:(_
9/15/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: _not this garbage again. You told him you eat straight cheese blocks, didn't you?_
9/15/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/15/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But he...he...does something else weird I‚Äôm sure
9/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: _oh really? Any guesses?_
9/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Uh
9/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt seen his bdsm test results yet this isn‚Äôt fair
9/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Uh
9/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking
9/15/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: HE SAYS BOLTH
9/15/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: HE PLAYS THE FREAKING ACCORDION
9/15/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: _oh no, you haven't seen his test results?_
9/15/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: HE NAMED HIS BASIL PLANT
9/15/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: _poor thing_
9/15/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: ITS HIS FAULT!!!
9/15/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Oh and worst of all
9/15/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: He runs _Linux_
9/15/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: _what? Why's that an issue? What if he likes open source software? What's wrong with FOSS?_
9/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not an issue
9/15/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: _and kink-wise, I hope you have a dinosaur costume ready..._
9/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Just like me eating cheese is not an issue
9/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Oh darn I knew I should have squeezed it in my suitcase for abroad
9/15/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: _rookie mistake_
9/15/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: _anyway I'll talk to him about it_
9/15/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: _mostly because he secretly likes you_
9/15/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Aw he thinks it‚Äôs a secret?
9/15/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: (Sorry too cocky)
9/15/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: _well 99% of his Copenhagen friends and coworkers think he can't shut up about you so probably not_
9/15/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: _anyway this bit has been going on for too long_
9/15/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: *ahem* hello I heard there would be pictures
9/15/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Okay well then here‚Äôs a photo of me and my ass for you
9/15/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>

9/15/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: I love all of those
9/15/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: And definitely wasn't expecting photos of your big hairy ass
9/15/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: What a cutie though
9/15/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: The donkey is nice too
9/15/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: (those were two separate topics)
9/15/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: My favorite might be the haybale picture
9/15/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Lots of personality in that one
9/15/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/15/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Okay suuure
9/15/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah there‚Äôs a whole series of the haybale ones
9/15/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: The little kids on the ranch were dj-omg
9/15/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: Ing **
9/15/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: Also dinner is a SUCCESS over here
9/15/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: I really kind of have no idea what it is
9/15/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs good
9/15/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Dinner
9/15/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/15/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: That sounds like such a fun day though
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I wonder if there are any farms like that around Davidson
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Well
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Ranches
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: I would assume so
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I've spent a lot of time on farms and none of them were like that
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Which is the difference I guess
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Oh man your veggies look good
9/15/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: More animals less corn/chickens
9/15/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm kind of struggling over here because having to cook for Sarah means I can‚Äôt cook a lot of what I want to
9/15/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: And I was like well then what do your parents cook and she said they cook chicken in a pan with salt and pepper
9/15/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: And well I never
9/15/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs like I need to feed her but there‚Äôs not a lot she can eat that tastes good
9/15/19, 8:13 PM - Marianna: So she just picks around the veggies I cook with things mostly
9/15/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/15/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Do you need to feed her?
9/15/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: I get that it's better to cook for two, and always more fun, and it takes care of leftovers
9/15/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: But also, she needs to broaden her horizons, especially if you're doing her the service of cooking for her
9/15/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: Well it‚Äôs the things she‚Äôs allergic to
9/15/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not like she can do anything about it
9/15/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: So I feel bad
9/15/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt think I can be like you know what Sarah I don‚Äôt want to cook for you anymore
9/15/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs easier for me if I only did because then I could get through most of the week only cooking once instead of twice that amount
9/15/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: Idk well see how to semester goes
9/15/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/15/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah that makes sense
9/15/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: That's a tough situation, I'm sorry
9/15/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: I obviously don't know Sarah well enough to give any useful advice
9/15/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Sorry about that
9/15/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: But I hope things work out and you guys find a good balance
9/15/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Does she like cooking at all? Could you alternate maybe?
9/15/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs okay
9/15/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt really see a solution I wasn‚Äôt expecting you to
9/15/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: (No offense)
9/15/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: And nooooo
9/15/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs been talking about how lucky she is to have me to cook for her for MONTHS
9/15/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah no worries, it's just times like these that I wish I was more helpful
9/15/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: But if you ever want to just talk about it I'm all ears
9/15/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: And oooooooooooooooooh nooooo that makes it harder
9/15/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: A lot harder
9/15/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: it‚Äôs okay I don‚Äôt keep ya around to solve my problems
9/15/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Although if you could work on world peace that would be amazing
9/15/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: Aye aye captain
9/15/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: I'll do my best
9/15/19, 8:53 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm counting on you
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think I'll work on other problems
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: First at least
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: What
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Like my homework
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: But the world

9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Stepping stones Marianna
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Stepping stones
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: I just made a calculator app
9/15/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: WOOOO
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: You could literally put it on your phone
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: .apk?

9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: SEND IT

9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Android studio is great
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs crap
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: It's a great emulator
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: NO
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: SEND
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: The emulator is so fun!!!
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: No :(
9/15/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send other cool things
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send my final project because I want to actually have it on my phone so I can use it but if I can‚Äôt then at least someone should be able to
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: NOOOO
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: How am I gonna calculate things now
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: With my brain?
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Brain
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I have like 2 brain cells left Marianna
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Brian?
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Brian cells
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Or you know the actual calculator you have
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: That's who I'll use
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Or the actual calculator app on your phone
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Booo
9/15/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: All mine does is add and subtract
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: But it deals with floats!!
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Like
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: As in non integer numbers
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Which someone was complaining that they couldn‚Äôt figure that out
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Or like float operations
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs a simple casting function call so idk what they are doing
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Floating point arithmetic
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Non int numbers but it can add them and subtract them too
9/15/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: And negatives!
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Ooo
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Fancy fancy
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Idk
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt code that part, it figured it out
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: I'd still love to see it
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Because that‚Äôs how numbers work
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Idk how to actually send it to you but I‚Äôll take a snap video of me playing with it
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Throw that baby on drive and I'll install it
9/15/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Or decompile it
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: But idk how to do anything you just said there
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just looking st the code it‚Äôs not a deliverable package
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Wait you don't know how to upload things to Google drive
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Or idk what folder is
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I HATE google drive first off
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: WHAT
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Hate it
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Y tho
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Sheets?  Nah man
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Y
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Tho
9/15/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: ü§î
9/15/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Is it because you don't trust Google over gross privacy violations? Because I get that
9/15/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Sorry my parents called
9/15/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: And no I don‚Äôt
9/15/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: But I also just don‚Äôt like the interface
9/15/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Like I feel like sheets and docs and things are much less sophisticated and I can‚Äôt do as much as word and excel
9/15/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Sorry I just got off the phone with my parents
9/15/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: How are you! How was your day!
9/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Also these are the math puns that I stay around for
9/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Absolutely beautiful
9/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Eloquent
9/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Effortless
9/15/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Also it's funny, I think our parents both called around the exact same time
9/15/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the parents instinct in them
9/15/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Sunday afternoon means make sure the kids are alive
9/15/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/15/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Silence can only mean bad things with kids
9/15/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: It's true isn't it
9/15/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Yeah they were complaining to me about silence from Joey
9/15/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/15/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: I was wondering today
9/15/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: How's he doing? You still getting updates from that front?
9/15/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Not as many
9/15/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: He went to tropiKAl
9/15/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: He was in the LIBRARY until like 9 pm on Friday
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Wew
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: True Davidson boy now
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: F was dry last night like none of the frats had alcohol
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Dry F
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Woah I‚Äôve never done that
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Oh sweet lord
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Oh man
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: 221 I was in the library until 12 on a Friday once
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: I think it was boggle
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Fun time with that class
9/15/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: OH NO
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: My big said it was to show the administration that the freshmen would already be drunk before they got down there so it‚Äôs not Fs fault freshmen drink
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Oh no?
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Wait yeah it was boggle nevermind
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Boggle was fun
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Or was it
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Shoot
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: It was 3 years ago, I don't remember
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Some recursive torture
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: The only time I did homework on Friday was the Friday before self selection
9/15/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Freshmen year
9/15/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a BIG fan of do it Sunday night
9/15/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Well not a fan of it
9/15/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs what I end up doing
9/15/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/15/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: (the one without Chris)
9/15/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm a big fan of Sunday hikes honestly, so I try to get it done Saturday during the day
9/15/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: That sounds like some classic Marc Todd bs
9/15/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: He always sounds like he‚Äôs answering interview questions for harvard law school
9/15/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: I don't really like him
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good point but I doubt the Martin court kids actually get in trouble for any of that
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: I especially realized it after working with him
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Oh I guarantee they do
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Really?
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah the school hates F
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: It's a constant thorn in Walter's side
9/15/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Yeah but who are you gonna blame logistically it‚Äôs the FRAT not the individuals
9/15/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: It trickles down
9/15/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: The town complains to Walter who tightens the clamp on Cale, who calls the RAs down to his office, who then are on the line for getting members of frats in check
9/15/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: And not to mention the school constantly threatens literally disbanding frats
9/15/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: It's constant strife
9/15/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah okay
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: This is why i like being in an eating house
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: And freshmen are dumbasses, it's their own responsibility, but at the same time F is a free flow of alcohol for them
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: And like not having to deal with the politics or procedure of all that
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Yeah but don‚Äôt you love it
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Oh man, if eating houses were a thing for guys I'd join one
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Talk to daniel and Sam
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: ?
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôve been pushing for it for years
9/15/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: #rushshannon
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Just drop that when you next talk to them
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah I think I'll pass on that one
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Thanks though
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Actually I‚Äôm not sure if Daniel would get it he wasn‚Äôt around as much freshmen year
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: My dad was in an eating house
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs now nummit
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: So nummit is kind of an eating house for guys
9/15/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: HA
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Eating nothing but toast
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: I see how it is
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Delicious, delicious toast
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: Hot take I don‚Äôt like the toast
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Expensive, delicious toast
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: _hello you've been blocked again, mr. whatsapp speaking_
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: :(
9/15/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm too tired for this
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: _mr whatsapp has left the chat_
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: this isn‚Äôt a threat but if you don‚Äôt talk to me I will just fall asleep
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Hello hello
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: It me
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Ya boy
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Everyone just hates when Marianna falls asleep
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Even the people outside my window
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Hey sleep is allowed
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: ... People outside your window?
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Do you need help
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah it needs to be soonish
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Blink twice if you need help
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: No no the bars and the square people
9/15/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Idk I can't tell if you blinked
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: So under my window
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: I didn't think this through much
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Silly Caleb
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Do they have a gun to your head
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Cough twice if they do
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Also I figured out how the spelling of your name would sound in Hungarian and it‚Äôs kind of funny
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Okay wait roll your eyes if you need help
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Nah I have a pig I‚Äôll be fine
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOD I'M COMING
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah you can feel that
9/15/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: IT'S OKAY
9/15/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: I'll be there in about 3 weeks just sit tight
9/15/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Oh! What would my name be?
9/15/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Oh and speaking of tired and sleep, sorry we didn't get a chance to call tonight
9/15/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: I did but only because how ridiculous this is getting
9/15/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: There was way more work than I expected, and then my parents called semi-unexpectedly
9/15/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll one up you
9/15/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be THERE in like 12 days
9/15/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Hey, I'm very very excited for that
9/15/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Ts-aw-leh-b
9/15/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: ... How is that pronounced?
9/15/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs it phonetically
9/15/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: C is like ts in bits
9/15/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Theres no k sound?
9/15/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: And that's funny, it's like the C in Chinese
9/15/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: If you were to spell it in the Hungarian alphabet it would have to be kelab
9/15/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: In Chinese language*
9/15/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Maybe k√©lab
9/15/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: And no problem
9/15/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: I have actually been busy calling another +46 number tonight
9/15/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Woah really?
9/15/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: +45**
9/15/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Ha I was gonna say
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Marion is having a tad bit of boy troubles again
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm +36 so I got confused
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: That must be a country away from me, that's crazy
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Lol no worries
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Is mitch still having reservations about keeping going?
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt worry marion says if he breaks up with her, she has her tinder profile and boys lined up
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs just being weird
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Wait so she's been swiping here?
9/15/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not entirely his fault
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Damn Marion
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Fast moving
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: No she just redownloaded it or made her profile again or soemthing
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: It's almost preemptive
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Keep in mind they are still dating
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah I was going to say
9/15/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: I was like uh marion you still have him don‚Äôt get ahead
9/15/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I are gonna do bumble BFF here to meet Hungarian gals to tell us the best coffee shops/clubs/bars
9/15/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Bumble bff? That's a thing?
9/15/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Is that different from the regular one?
9/15/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs like bumble has three different decks you can put your card in, the dating one, the bff one, and the professional networking one
9/15/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Idk how well the bff or networking one work
9/15/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: But I think bff is just for girls to make friends
9/15/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Doesn‚Äôt seem like a way guys would make friends
9/15/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Well okay I guess
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Sounds kind of cool?
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Idk
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Idk either
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: I'd like to meet Danes here
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll give it a try
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Not entirely sure the kind of people who use it to make friends
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: But it makes sense if you‚Äôre new to an area I guess
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: People are gonna be like "oh so how did you meet your Danish friends?" and I'll go "Bumble"
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Also thank you for liking berniebonbons horse girl comment
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: HA
9/15/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you saw
9/15/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Eh I‚Äôm still not sure guys can use it
9/15/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: But go for it
9/15/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Make those danish friends
9/15/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: I saw the comment and was like NOOOOO
9/15/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh well that's nice it restricts it to gender honestly
9/15/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: and then I saw it had a like and I rolled my eyes and was like no he did not this had better not have been him
9/15/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: I feel like otherwise it would basically be tinder but with more steps and false pretences
9/15/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: ... buuuut here we are Marianna
9/15/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: With me agreeing with some rando you know who is probably so confused
9/15/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/15/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Idk if it still could be
9/15/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: But hey for the record I‚Äôm not on the dating one and have no desire to use this one for dating so if someone does turn up with false pretenses I will be just as shocked
9/15/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs joeys best friend from high school
9/15/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Really weird kid
9/15/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Not very nice to me but in like a younger brother way
9/15/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: He really likes communism and sarcasm and it can just come out a little mean sometimes like I like sarcasm a lot but there are sarcastic jokes I can‚Äôt do because they sound too real and cruel
9/15/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Huh
9/15/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah that definitely sounds like an odd one
9/15/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: But hey who isn't a little odd
9/15/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: I'm certainly not one to talk
9/15/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm going to go to bed because my eyes can't focus on the words anymore
9/15/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: I guess I'm still sick, I've definitely felt really drained this afternoon too
9/15/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! If you're free tomorrow maybe we could talk then?
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: See! Got you to admit you‚Äôre weird!
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I won @mrwhatsapp
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Okay I should do
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Doesn't take much I'll be honest
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: I embrace it anyway
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: My music is getting slower and lulling me so I‚Äôd be gone in a few minutes
9/15/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre still sick though
9/15/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: And yes, goodnight and I have yoga until like 10pm but I have my last day Tuesday so I can stay up a little longer so it should work if you‚Äôre okay with late!
9/15/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Sleep well Copenhagen boy
9/15/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Copenhagen boy
9/15/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness
9/15/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Now I feel like I need a clever name for you
9/15/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Well, whatever
9/15/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Goodnight Marianna, sov godt!
9/16/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: I feel like marianna is a clever name
9/16/19, 7:16 AM - Caleb: Well
9/16/19, 7:17 AM - Caleb: Marianna is a clever girl so I guess it checks out
9/16/19, 7:18 AM - Marianna: Have you seen Jurassic Park
9/16/19, 7:20 AM - Caleb: I'll give you one guess
9/16/19, 7:21 AM - Caleb: And the hint is that the answer rhymes with "dough"
9/16/19, 7:26 AM - Marianna: Aw
9/16/19, 7:26 AM - Marianna: You see that‚Äôs a pity
9/16/19, 7:26 AM - Marianna: Because you just made a beautiful reference to something in one of them
9/16/19, 7:26 AM - Marianna: One of my favorite lines in the whole movie
9/16/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah well I know about the "Clever girl" line
9/16/19, 7:28 AM - Caleb: For some reason I know a lot of movie references despite not having actually seen the movies
9/16/19, 7:28 AM - Caleb: Sorry
9/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: ThaTs chEATiNg
9/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: Does genuinely hurt my sole a little bit
9/16/19, 7:29 AM - Caleb: Your sole? Sounds like you need better shoes then
9/16/19, 7:49 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna need new shoes after I walk up there to slap you for all these things!
9/16/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Ha
9/16/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Come and get me.
9/16/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: You know you loved it
9/16/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Also, 8am crossfit kills the body AND the soul!
9/16/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: I'm pretty dead ngl
9/16/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: We did 40 minutes of circuit training, and I was absolutely KILLED by the last set
9/16/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: So she puts on a final song, one to really pump everyone up and push through the pain
9/16/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: That song, you ask?
9/16/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/k85mRPqvMbE
9/16/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: That's right. Crazy. Frog.
9/16/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: The specter from 2009 that haunts us daily.
9/16/19, 9:20 AM - Caleb: Suddenly, I hear "*doo do do do-do do do*, bing bing", and I power through my last set
9/16/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Yeah why they actual HECK would you sign up for that
9/16/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: I mean good for you
9/16/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: But that does sound like I would do
9/16/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Die**
9/16/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: I like my yoga because I feel BETTER afterwards not like dead
9/16/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Also I missed python
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs such a nice language
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: Python
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: Where the worst thing that can happen is that it doesn't compile
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: What a delight
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: And yeah I feel better too right now
9/16/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: I came back and cooked for myself for the first time in a while
9/16/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Yeah
9/16/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Python is so well behaved
9/16/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not gonna let me crash and burn no sir
9/16/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna tell em exactly what is up
9/16/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Love communicative error messages
9/16/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Oh what‚Äôs you cook!
9/16/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: Oh it was just eggs and toast
9/16/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: But ever since the fridge got shut off I just haven't had the energy to go buy groceries or cook really
9/16/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: Also, what do you like about yoga specifically? Is it the emotional centering, or the physical part?
9/16/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Hey eggs and toast is nice
9/16/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm eating. A chocolate croissant rn
9/16/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: I like the physical part the most but also I just feel better after yoga. Like I feel awake and cheerful and warm
9/16/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt really know what it is
9/16/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Yeah weirdly enough I used to get that way after boxing
9/16/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Unexpectedly cheerful and warm
9/16/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: It just puts me in a better place both mentally and physically for some reason
9/16/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: ...you did boxing
9/16/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: HWHAT
9/16/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: Yeah it was after I did a lot of karate tournaments and I realized my favorite parts of it were sparing, so I kind of narrowed my focus
9/16/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: I never got seriously seriously into it, but it was one of the things I dabbled in I guess
9/16/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: I guess the other thing I liked the most about karate was knife and club defense, but that's a little harder to focus without getting seriously hurt
9/16/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: Also OH my goodness can we have a spa day here http://szechenyispabaths.com/
9/16/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I loved sparing as well
9/16/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt get into knife fighting
9/16/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: Or we‚Äôll it would have been cool if you did
9/16/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm at least glad you didn‚Äôt he tknifed
9/16/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: Get knifed**
9/16/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: My space bar just hates me
9/16/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: But you probably would have gotten some gnarly scars
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: And well are you set on that one specific bath?  Because it‚Äôs the most touristy. So do you want to do that one or just a bath in general or would you mind it being very touristy?
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Well
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Up to you
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Also let me know other things you‚Äôd want to do while here!  I have some plans but would love more ideas
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm not telling you any of the plans
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: YAY
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: They are all gonna be surprises
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I love surprises
9/16/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: I will tell you what kinds of clothes you‚Äôll need though
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Perfect pwrfext
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Not now but when you‚Äôre packing and I have a more solid plan
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: I'm going to need a swimsuit I'm guessing?
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Also we‚Äôll see what the weathers like
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Probably if you want to do the baths
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Cool
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I might try them out next weekend
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: I'll be sure to buy the most Scandinavian one I can
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Also I just tried to say pwrfext in my head and now my head hurts
9/16/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Did you not bring one?
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Nooooope I forgot
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Ah well I can‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôve had too much use for it
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: But you did go to the beach soo
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: I just wore running shorts though
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: They worked perfectly
9/16/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: (thanks Ben)
9/16/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: BIG STRESSOR OF THE DAY is people talking about how they already have interviews set up for internships and someone flew back to the us for an interview last week
9/16/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: And I haven‚Äôt even started looking and it‚Äôs just KILLING ME like I‚Äôm sitting at lunch and my mind is freaking out but so I guess I‚Äôm looking at internships tonight but ah I need a job
9/16/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: But anyway how is your day
9/16/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: ACK
9/16/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: INTERNSHIPS
9/16/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: Don't worry I already know you'll have a super cool super interesting internship next summer
9/16/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: Things will fall into place
9/16/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: You'll be where you need to be
9/16/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: Gosh I can't imagine flying back to the US just for an interview
9/16/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: And my days been good
9/16/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: Felt productive but I still have a lot of work
9/16/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Class was kinda frustrating because I had thing I wanted to say, but my sinuses wouldn't let me say it
9/16/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: I'd start talking and then have to cut it short because my throat would get clogged
9/16/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: How are you? How were classes?
9/16/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: Eh I just don‚Äôt want to think about it
9/16/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah It looks like I‚Äôll have a good bit of work this week :(
9/16/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm sorry about the sinuses :(
9/16/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: Classes were good
9/16/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: Really liked crypto and compbio again
9/16/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: I think Monday might be my favorite combination of classes
9/16/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm still tired
9/16/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: And I want to get home and be productive
9/16/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: But I need to go grocery shopping and laundry and I have yoga tonight which is gonna take 2 hours of my time counting travel
9/16/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: FREEDOM
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: CONGRATS
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Now on metro
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Oh hello
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you had a good day of classes
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: How's the homework in crypto? Still fun?
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Yup
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Next we have stream ciphers
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: And what did you learn in comp bio!
9/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt really looked at the homework for Friday but yeah
9/16/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Also sounds like you have a license to go home and nap
9/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: It was actually mostly math today
9/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Lots of diff eq and linear algebra and I was really into it
9/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: I am home
9/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: And I am not napping
9/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Well that's tragic
9/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: The not napping thing
9/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Also, what exactly is diff eq? I think that's the 5th time someone mentioned it to me today
9/16/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Differential equations
9/16/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Aka my one true love
9/16/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Favorite class so far
9/16/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: It always cheers me up
9/16/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: Yeah but like what is that
9/16/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: As a field
9/16/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: Derivatives
9/16/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: Modeling real life phenomena
9/16/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: WOAH COOL
9/16/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Also I've realized there's like 0 percent chance I would have survived in your program
9/16/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: It sounds like everyone is super smart and also way better at math than me
9/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm having a bad da
9/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: I feel like I can do math
9/16/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: We got into the A class of theory which is great but now we‚Äôre trying to do the homework and we can‚Äôt come up with t and I‚Äôm just like am I dumb????  How am I supposed to do thsi??? Shouldn‚Äôt I be getting it already????
9/16/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve just kind of had grumpy sad vibes all day and I am not here for it
9/16/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Sorry I don‚Äôt mean to be grumpy and sad I hate when I do this
9/16/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: :)
9/16/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/16/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Off days are allowed
9/16/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: And if you're ever feeling like that and just want to talk/vent/cry/get encouragement/whatever you need, just let me know
9/16/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: And first off, you're not dumb just to make sure you know
9/16/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: And if you're the smartest person in the room, then you're in the wrong room Marianna
9/16/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Keep your chin up though, you literally transferred from the other class into a harder class. If you ask for help and listen to people, you'll do great and adjust because should totally be expected
9/16/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah but I absolutely hate depending on people for emotional support
9/16/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Whoops got too real but it stresses me out
9/16/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm gonna go to yoga, come back and eat and drink wine and try again
9/16/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: I swear I‚Äôm not an alcoholic but I think wine will help here
9/16/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like I know there‚Äôs a pattern but I can‚Äôt come up with the universal rules
9/16/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Well it‚Äôs the same homework sooo
9/16/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Is that all you have tonight? And it's due tomorrow?
9/16/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: and BOOOO being real is great
9/16/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Important things to talk about
9/16/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Not over text
9/16/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: But important someday nonetheless
9/16/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Nah I‚Äôm done everything due tomorrow. I only have one class
9/16/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: And yeah I like real abstract conversations but I hate feeling like I‚Äôm complaining and being a burden
9/16/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: But I love complaining I guess but most of my complaining is trivial and not asking for emotional support
9/16/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: But yeah
9/16/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôve got headphones and metro ride to yoga
9/16/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/16/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: One a lighter note
9/16/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/16/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: I just sent a video of one of my friends friends trying a banana for the first time ever
9/16/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: It's very endearing, she wasn't a fan of the texture
9/16/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: But now she can say she's tried a banana
9/16/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Also fun fact her dad used to work for a banana company
9/16/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Ain't that some irony?
9/16/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: On**
9/16/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: :)
9/16/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: ...why has she never had a banana
9/16/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: How do you avoid that in life
9/16/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Idk
9/16/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: She did it somehow
9/16/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: But not anymore
9/16/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: They say abroad will change you life
9/16/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: But I don't think she was expecting it in this way
9/16/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Is she a ya student abroad now?  And where is she?
9/16/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Us**
9/16/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/16/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: She lives in our building I think
9/16/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: She goes to villanova and is from Pittsburgh
9/16/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: So I'm like
9/16/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Who are you
9/16/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: How did you do this
9/16/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: How did you get away with this
9/16/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: Also this is a long shot but I was thinking last night while I was texting you. I always fall asleep to music or at least listen to it right before I get to bed. I recently decided I‚Äôd stick with one playlist or one album a week to be my settling down to bed music. Then I thought well I‚Äôm always talking to you when I do this so I was wondering if you wanted to idk share which album we each were listening to each week so we could like do it together while talking to each other or something
9/16/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs weird and a random though so if not that‚Äôs totally fine I just thought if you‚Äôd want to that could be cool
9/16/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: Yeah wait do they just not have bananas in philly
9/16/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: Wait you lived there
9/16/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: And basically all you are where bananas
9/16/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/16/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: My
9/16/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Goodness
9/16/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: I love that idea
9/16/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: I'm in :)
9/16/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: What's your album this week?
9/16/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: Also
9/16/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: No
9/16/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/16/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: Very yes üôÉ
9/16/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: I used to go through phases where I'd listen to one or two albums CONSTANTLY to fall asleep
9/16/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: And I'd listen to them for like 3 months and then not ever again
9/16/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: At the beginning of this semester I was just listening to my cozy playlist but I got bored of it
9/16/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: https://open.spotify.com/album/4ieLwljBoO1svXM5K6UtzA?si=w8dzJg-ATeSo2VaN22H3yA
9/16/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: And phew I was really nervous you‚Äôd be like no that‚Äôs weird why‚Äôd I do that
9/16/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: So I sent it right before yoga so I wouldn‚Äôt have to sit and stare at my phone for a response :)
9/16/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: ALSO this won‚Äôt be exciting for you but I got BOTH (bolth) plow pose and fish pose for the first time tonight and at least plow, Ive tried it a lot and never been able to because I couldn‚Äôt be that flexible so it‚Äôs kind of exciting for me
9/16/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: It was a pretty crappy plow but at least it was something!
9/16/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: WOOOOOOO
9/16/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: Go you!
9/16/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure what that means but it sounds like an accomplishment so I'm very proud
9/16/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Yes it‚Äôs always super fun to get new poses
9/16/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Even if they are bad the first time I do them
9/16/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôm going to meet Sarah and her Hungarian boy and friends in the park
9/16/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: But I was like Sarah I can‚Äôt stay long I need food and sleep
9/16/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: And wine
9/16/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I want some wine
9/16/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Mark my words
9/16/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: One day I'm gonna make you drag me alone to yoga so I can finally understand and embarrass myself trying it
9/16/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: And oooOooOoOOOO Sarah and M√°rk are getting real friendly
9/16/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: I see this going places
9/16/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Also get your wine, finish your work
9/16/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Live your best life
9/16/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: I support it
9/16/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Hey you can do that when you‚Äôre here
9/16/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Although the classes I go to are not the easiest
9/16/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: But we can try
9/16/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: And yeah!  I think she genuinely really likes him
9/16/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: So I did my part and hung out with them and one of his friends and I got to impress them with how much Hungarian I knew (not much but no one learns it and it‚Äôs more than Sarah so by comparison it‚Äôs a lot)
9/16/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: And apparently my pronunciation is pretty good
9/16/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: But I knew that
9/16/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just like imitation
9/16/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Awwwwww
9/16/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm walking back now for food and Prosecco
9/16/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: Did you still want to call tonight?
9/16/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: I'm rooting for them
9/16/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/16/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Although man people have have crushes can be annoying because they like talking about them
9/16/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm too happy for her to be annoyed
9/16/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Didn't you say tomorrow would be better for you?
9/16/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: And ahaaaaaaa annoying people with crushes
9/16/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/16/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Which I'm sure I sometimes tread close to
9/16/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: No tonight because I don‚Äôt have class until 11 tomorrow morning
9/16/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: But if it doesn‚Äôt work for it tomorrow would also work for me
9/16/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: It would just have to be earlier tomorrow
9/16/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Oh for sure me too
9/16/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Aha
9/16/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Perfect
9/16/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Let me take contacts out and brush my teeth then
9/16/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: But I also recognize I‚Äôm being annoying so TRY to hold it to a minimum
9/16/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Okay let me get back to my apt and then I‚Äôll call?  Like 5-10 min?
9/16/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: Sounds good
9/16/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: On both accounts
9/16/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Okie dokie call whenever
9/17/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: Missed voice call
9/17/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm guessing your phone died?
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Caleb: Sov godt
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Caleb: I think I am gonna try to learn Danish
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Caleb: At least a little
9/17/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: Yeah no seriously that‚Äôs as very nice to talk to you I would have been very bored while Sarah was out
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: Hey
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Duolingo.com!
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: Any time
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Hey

9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: I got hit with the champ
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Alright
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: I do bud people a lot
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: ... Kiddo?
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: Oh nevermind taking that one back
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Nope Sarah does that
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Everyone is kid or kiddo to Sarah
9/17/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: Paaaal?
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: Yes I‚Äôm just your pal
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: A might good pal
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been telling my parents so that works
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: :)
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: Hey
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: You've been palzoned
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: Oof
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: Go to sleep
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been PALZONED?
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: Which sounds like a calzone
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: And now you're hungry
9/17/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: I feel like there is some mobility in the palzone
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: I do love calzones
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: Some mobility?
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: Much better than pizza
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt worry about it
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: You gonna try to finesse the pal zone?
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt worry about it
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: HEY
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: THAT'S MY LINE
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: *AND* WISHY WASHY
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs on brand
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: Brutal
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs my line now
9/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: Brutal but honest
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: Wait hwhat
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: Also you stole my lines it‚Äôs only fair my man
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: WHAT

9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: **dabs**
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: Malarkey
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: oh no
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: Ehem the Instagram incident
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah I do dab
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: Mom pick me up
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs really embarrassing
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: I'm at a party and kids are drinking
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: But I do it
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Caleb: No mom please hurry I want to go home
9/17/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: ü§™
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Marianna: ü•≥
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Caleb: _hi, if you're receiving this message..._
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Best Intentions by Hodera
https://open.spotify.com/track/30x4FrHvLeQquxj58kjdHi?si=vzh_kuS1RH-BEJsyHKvndg
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Marianna: Nah I‚Äôm done here‚Äôs a song
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Caleb: _....it means the sender went to bed for real now_
9/17/19, 12:35 AM - Marianna: Idk if it will be your kind but it‚Äôs a little emo
9/17/19, 12:36 AM - Marianna: GOODNIGHT
9/17/19, 12:36 AM - Caleb: Goodnight! It was fun talking, wish me morning luck
9/17/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: Morning me**
9/17/19, 8:11 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/17/19, 8:11 AM - Caleb: Update from the meme page
9/17/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Wow that is good content
9/17/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm lawful evil
9/17/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: Lawful neutral
9/17/19, 9:45 AM - Caleb: I guess I can tolerate you then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/17/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: that is a genius meme
9/17/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: I wonder if he's a freshman
9/17/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt believe you say edooroam
9/17/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt recognize the name
9/17/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Not that I know everyone on campus I guess
9/17/19, 9:53 AM - Caleb: Geez ms. popular over here
9/17/19, 9:53 AM - Caleb: I mean there's always the chance that he doesn't actually go here lol
9/17/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: I thought it was a closed group?
9/17/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: But who am I kidding I don‚Äôt know how Facebook works
9/17/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: In other news Joey was on Brooke‚Äôs snapchat story last night and it‚Äôs so weird like are they friends?
9/17/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Maybe I don‚Äôt want to know
9/17/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Anyway how was class #1?
9/17/19, 11:31 AM - Caleb: Class 1 was good
9/17/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: It was the deep learning one
9/17/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: LOTS of math
9/17/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: I had to remember how to do many derivatives
9/17/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: We were about hand calculating back propagation
9/17/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: So a little tedious
9/17/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Class 2 was stressful
9/17/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: A paper I thought was due Friday is due Thursday
9/17/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: And I have test Thursday in another class
9/17/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: So I'm a little stressed out now
9/17/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: But kicking my butt in gear
9/17/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: How are you? Have any class yet?
9/17/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Hey hey
9/17/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I love math
9/17/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I LOVE derivatives
9/17/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: And oh no I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs awful when you learn things pop
9/17/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: But do you have any field trips tomorrow?
9/17/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey
9/17/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: I do too
9/17/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: But it's rough when everyone else is an actual math/CS person and I'm here, not having derived something since senior year of high school
9/17/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: And nope! Which means my day will be this and studying for that test
9/17/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: On the bright side this is some cool architecture stuff
9/17/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: It would be a lot worse if it was boring work
9/17/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: Still just a _little_ panicked, but everything will work out
9/17/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: Oh wow yeah
9/17/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôve only taken linear?
9/17/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs not the worst Wednesday plan I‚Äôve ever heard
9/17/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the test in?
9/17/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad we have only like 4 midterms and 3 finals and no other tests
9/17/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: But darn I‚Äôd better do good on those
9/17/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/17/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: I've only taken linear
9/17/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: That's why I'm a fake CS kid
9/17/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: I always feel like I'm just waiting for someone to realize I'm absolutely faking this whole CS thing hahaha
9/17/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: And the test is cancer bio, so I'm not too concerned but I still need to study
9/17/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: And it's the same here! So few grades, which is nice and awful at the same time
9/17/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: No busy work though so heyyyy what's up
9/17/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Dear Marianna
9/17/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Today one of my professors went off on a tangent about Danish horse girls
9/17/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: Thinking of you in these wonderful times,

Sincerely,
Caleb "Percival" Grenko
9/17/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: P.s. The specific Danish word is "Hastepige"
9/17/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Well linear is the most important math for cs
9/17/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: So you‚Äôre doing great my guy
9/17/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: And ah well at least you probably have seen the material before?
9/17/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: Dear caleb
9/17/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: I am neither danish nor a horse girl
9/17/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm going to politely ask you to stfu
9/17/19, 3:44 PM - Marianna: Sincerely,
Marianna Ghirardelli
9/17/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: Ps there is no special word for stfu in Hungarian so it‚Äôs universal and I assume my message will be read loud and clear
9/17/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Dearest Marianna:
9/17/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/17/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: I hope this letter finds you well. Enclosed is a picture of said party riding a horse. I am blatantly ignoring the fact that I too have ridden a horse, as this is all in jest anyway.

Sincerely,
C.M."P."G.

P.S. I am very happy you had such a wonderful day at the farm, I hope you didn't take any of this too seriously and I also now want to let animals, particularly a baby cow
9/17/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: ALSO
9/17/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: I think I'm closing in on the weekend activities for when you're here
9/17/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: But if you have any requests/things you want to do please let me know!
9/17/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Also any/all of your friends are welcome at any point for them if you want
9/17/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: What about a baby cow
9/17/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: I miss my cow
9/17/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Just the two things I sent earlier I think
9/17/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: And I am assuming Sarah will want to hang with us for most of the weekend. But I‚Äôm pretty sure she will also accept if there is anything you‚Äôd just want to do with me so she doesn‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs third wheeling
9/17/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/17/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Something about me
9/17/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Important
9/17/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a little strange because obviously Marion and Margaux are also there but I‚Äôm much closer with them and Marion and Margaux don‚Äôt get super along anyway
9/17/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: But I have told everyone I request club night all together I was thinking Saturday night but idk what Marion‚Äôs plan is Friday night because we get in so late
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: But you are welcome to tag along to me and my friends clubbing
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: We may need someone to Shepard us
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Sorry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Something about you
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: When someone's third wheeling or there's just a third person in general, I sometimes overcompensate with trying to include them, and the person I'm with sometimes might feel like I'm not paying attention to them
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: Or at least that's what I've been told
9/17/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Also Sarah and I got chimney cakes on the way home it‚Äôs been a good day
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Ah got it
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: So if that happens or starts to, just please tell me
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: I think I do that too
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: HA
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Perfect
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: We can completely ignore each other then
9/17/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Or if there is someone I know less, I either ignore them or ignore the person I know more and interrogate the new person
9/17/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: And re:clubbing
9/17/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: I'm sure Marion is going to be up for clubbing Friday
9/17/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: It's more an issue of what you're feeling I'd guess
9/17/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: And sounds good! I don't mind shepherding as long as I vaguely know what to expect before hand
9/17/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: I also don't know your friends super well though, so I feel like I'd feel a little awkward being not only the only soberish one, but also being the only outsider
9/17/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk what I‚Äôll be feeling
9/17/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: I also don‚Äôt mean to make you feel weird with it
9/17/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: I was thinking marion would probably be planning with her friends so we might just tag along idk
9/17/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: And well none of us know ever what‚Äôs gonna happen
9/17/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Part of the fun with us all is the unknown
9/17/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah no thats totally fine
9/17/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: I just don't want to happen to me what happened to Reid
9/17/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Where I get invited out by Marion thinking she wants to hang out, and then figure out she wanted me exclusively to play security and keep me out until 4 am
9/17/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: Like, I don't mind being the responsible one as long as people are upfront and honest about it
9/17/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah that‚Äôs not a super cool move
9/17/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: Well we can be honest and say we don‚Äôt know!
9/17/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/17/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: I'll totally take it
9/17/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: It also might end up being that it would work out best for me to stay in while yall are out and do homework/take care of all my stuff so I can be truly free the rest of the weekend
9/17/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: And I finish earlier I'll just catch up if you want
9/17/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: Oh :(
9/17/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/17/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: But then I‚Äôm dragging you out to the clubs in Budapest
9/17/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Oh don't worry
9/17/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: I'm already H Y P E
9/17/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: Next week is just going to be frontloading the work to free up my weekend as much as I can
9/17/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: BUT anyway there's no need to actually figure out exactly what's going on that night, it's reserved for the girls
9/17/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: How were classes?
9/17/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: Or your one class I guess
9/17/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: Ezpz Tuesdays
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Did
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Did
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Did you just say
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: E
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Z
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: P
9/17/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Z
9/17/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: Class was good!
9/17/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: Hungarian is my most boring
9/17/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: But the teacher is so sweet and funny
9/17/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: Then we did a POW wow of theory of comp homework and figured it out!!!
9/17/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: Took some whiteboards and discussion but we got it
9/17/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Why yes, yes I suppose I did say ezpz
9/17/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: And good! What's a pow wow? Besides a super fun thing to say
9/17/19, 4:56 PM - Marianna: But made me feel much better to get it!  No longer feel dumb because we were were with A section students and I had to explain some stuff to them sooooo
9/17/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Like a get together
9/17/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: But with brains
9/17/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: No Brian‚Äôs
9/17/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Like working together
9/17/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Oh damn
9/17/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Look at you go
9/17/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Explaining things to A sections kids
9/17/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: What a champ
9/17/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Seeeeee everyone struggles, some just don't show it as easily
9/17/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: You're doing great
9/17/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: It was fun
9/17/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: I like homework
9/17/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: But now I‚Äôm watching Netflix whoooooo
9/17/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: what have you been up to?
9/17/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Well
9/17/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Im currently in the library getting my ducks in a row for this essay
9/17/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: And maybe friends will show up in a bit
9/17/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: I tried to send you a snapchat but my phone crashed
9/17/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: So I should proooobably not do that again, but I saw you and piglet hanging out
9/17/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Looks very snuggly
9/17/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Well the ducks may scatter when your friends show up
9/17/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Thought ducks usually do that
9/17/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: And yes he‚Äôs so soft I may fall asleep not gonna lie
9/17/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Wait
9/17/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Have you ever held baby chicks
9/17/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Just like in the palm of your hand
9/17/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: NO
9/17/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: HAVE YOU
9/17/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/17/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Yes I have
9/17/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: See these are the perks of growing up in rural areas
9/17/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: That and there'd ALWAYS be barn cats to play with at my friends house
9/17/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Until I got allergic :(
9/17/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: OH
9/17/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: That AND baby bunnies
9/17/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: And big bunnies
9/17/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: And regular sized bunnies
9/17/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: All sorts of bunnies
9/17/19, 5:27 PM - Marianna: Aw now I want to
9/17/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: I love bunnies
9/17/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: We have barn cats at the ranch
9/17/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: The only issue with barn cats is that you forget they're wild animals
9/17/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: And randomly they'll drag back a bird or rabbit or mouse that's dying
9/17/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: And they'll look so proud
9/17/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: It's a real wake up call for kids I guess
9/17/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: Ours never did that
9/17/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: We fed them too well
9/17/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: They also ate snakes which was good
9/17/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Good kitties
9/17/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Very good
9/17/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: You get your nap in?
9/17/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: No
9/17/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: :(
9/17/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: But I went grocery shopping
9/17/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: And now I‚Äôm back in bed with Netflix and a pig
9/17/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Ooooo
9/17/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Still fun
9/17/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: What's for dinner tonight?
9/17/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Leftovers :(
9/17/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: But good leftovers
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Good leftovers are still good
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: We made some kind of yogurt/feta/garlic/rosemary marinated chicken and it‚Äôs so good
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: OOOOOOOOOOOO
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: It was SOOOOO easy too
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Yogurt as a sauce is excellent
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Mind hitting me with a recipe there
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Combined all ingredients, marinated for 30 min, and cooked for 8
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs on the doc
9/17/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Chicken brochettes
9/17/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Wonderful
9/17/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Thank you again
9/17/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Right now I'm at a restaurant getting galettes
9/17/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Well
9/17/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Waiting on friends
9/17/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Then getting galettes
9/17/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Hmm

9/17/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Let me tell you
9/17/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: I hate galettes
9/17/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: But you enjoy

9/17/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: NO YOU DIDN'T
9/17/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: I thought you had a galette!
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: No no galettes are crepes made with buckwheat
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: I thought it was made with buckwheat
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Maybe I wasn't paying attention though
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Nope that was a normal crepe
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Good crepe
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Very good crepe
9/17/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Fun day
9/17/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Me like crepe
9/17/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Man that ice cream too
9/17/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: But it made me feel so bad
9/17/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: But it was tasty
9/17/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: Story of my life
9/17/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: You do like ice cream
9/17/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Will there be ice cream tonight?
9/17/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/17/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Maybe
9/17/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: There's always a possibility
9/17/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: The world is my oyster
9/17/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Ooooo

9/17/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna drink my red wine tonight
9/17/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: No ice cream though
9/17/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been eating too much junk my stomach hurts a bit
9/17/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Goodness gracious
9/17/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/17/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Cracking the wine pretty hard there
9/17/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: You got class early tomorrow?
9/17/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs an old bottle
9/17/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs like a big glass
9/17/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: And 9am :/

9/17/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Also awwwww
9/17/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: :(
9/17/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Why do you have to stay?
9/17/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOSH JAZZ MUSIC AND SWING DANCING
9/17/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: We should go to a jazz club
9/17/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: GO TO SWING DANCING
9/17/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Maybe they'll play Chet
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: man I miss Chet I haven‚Äôt listened to him a lot
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Chet should be an album we listen to for sleep
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Mentally I need to see here
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: But some of his get too jaaaaaaZzzzzzz
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Like too much sax
9/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: We love sax
9/17/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: But when all of a sudden it comes in, it‚Äôs a little disturbing
9/17/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: JazzZzzzzzzz
9/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: That's what happens when you fall asleep to it
9/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah stick to early Chet then
9/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Usually it's just better in all aspects
9/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Sax is great
9/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: But you have to do sax tastefully
9/17/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: And you can't just have a out in the middle of the song out of no where
9/17/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: It's got to be blended and shielded by different instruments, or as we say in the industry- practice safe sax
9/17/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Oh man
9/17/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: I can hear everyone having fun downstairs
9/17/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: This is getting tempting
9/17/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Missed voice call
9/17/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Practice
9/17/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Safe
9/17/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Sax
9/17/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Love it
9/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I vote fun
9/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I usually vote fun though
9/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Can be very bad for business
9/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: But hey I think you deserve a break
9/17/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: Also I think you have more work than I do
9/17/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt done any homework since like 3pm
9/17/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: I know you loved it
9/17/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: But I also felt the eye roll
9/17/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: And yeah I would if it was a weekend
9/17/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: But I'm worn out and just want to work
9/17/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: As odd as that is
9/17/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: If I don't do it now, it'll just come back to bite me
9/17/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: Also, accidental call I'm guessing?
9/17/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah sorry I was trying to stop the notifications that were coming it
9/17/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: No I respect the desire to do work
9/17/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: I have it sometimes
9/17/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: Just not now as I‚Äôm pressing next episode for like the 6th time
9/17/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: Yeah I have homework due on fri and sat I need to do
9/17/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: But you have big stuff due thurs
9/17/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: So I respect the no fun
9/17/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: Or the alternative fun
9/17/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Okay "alternative fun" is a stretch
9/17/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Sounds like alternative facts
9/17/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: And I'm not worried
9/17/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Something tells me I'll have _plenty_ of swing dancing in my future
9/17/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: And besides, I've got no one to swing dance with, which is more than half the fun
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SWING DANCE
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: because I love it
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: And no one I‚Äôve ever taken to any dances has known how to
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: James lied to me and said he did
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: He did not
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: I got the truth out of him after most of a bottle of wine
9/17/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: But darn did we try
9/17/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I think we drunkenly figured out one move by the end of it
9/17/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Well
9/17/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: I'm certainly not going to over-promise here
9/17/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: But no one I ever dance with is loose enough on their feet and it makes me sad
9/17/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: You just gotta go with it~
9/17/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Also that sounds like an absolute James move to pull
9/17/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: What a fella
9/17/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Oh you will 100% just be able to throw me around if ya want
9/17/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm great at following in dance
9/17/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: I can also lead
9/17/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs much more fun if everyone‚Äôs just on the same page
9/17/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: And you can get really fast and fun
9/17/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Some random guy who would really swing dance took anne ridenhour to fall fling freshman year and we switched dates for one round of swing dance and he was amazing
9/17/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/17/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Well I'm rusty, and I can guarantee that
9/17/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: But if you want to practice with me I'd be down
9/17/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Then maybe, just _maybe_ you could convince me to go to a dance with you ;)
9/17/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/17/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: There is a reason that there is swing dancing club
9/17/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: That has swing dancing meeting
9/17/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Where they TEACH you

9/17/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Maybe
9/17/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll have to convince me
9/17/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a lot of work to go to dance clubs
9/17/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah you're right not worth it
9/17/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/17/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I'm easily convinced I guess

9/17/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: I bet you could feel those eye bats
9/17/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: I did so many
9/17/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Nope
9/17/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: I require video evidence
9/17/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: No I‚Äôd feel so ridiculous
9/17/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: Piglet and Sarah would judge me
9/17/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt have that
9/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Well jokes on you because I AM REDICULOUS!
9/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: But fine
9/17/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: Ridiculous**

9/17/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: I firmly hold that there are some ascii emoticons that emojis will never replace
9/17/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: Not in my heart at least
9/17/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/17/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: I like to mix it up with both
9/17/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: They've got different ethos
9/17/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Anyway

9/17/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Made me feel validated and useful and it was challenging and fun and productive
9/17/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: What about you?
9/17/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Also where were you that had dancing?  We‚Äôre you just working there?  And then you went to a bar?
9/17/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Ooooo orbit

9/17/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Also

9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: And then I got the groundwork for my essay done
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: And I'm not actually at a bar!
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Well I'm sorta at a bar
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: It sometimes is a bar
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: THE TRUTH
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: You just got to add ‚Äúnot to sound like an alcoholic‚Äù at the beginning of that
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: It's called studenthuset
9/17/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve said that sentence a little too many times in the past week
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: It's "the student house"
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: And usually it's basically a study lounge/Caf√©
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: They just took out some letters I see
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: True Danish fashion
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs cool
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: But anyway
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: It's usually a study lounge and Cafe
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: But they also have beer/shots/mixed drinks on weekends
9/17/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: We went to a bar like that that apparently just slowly transitions from coffee and laptops to mixed drinks and socializing
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: And we got kicked out of the library since it closed
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: So we wanted to work here
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Oh no!
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm glad you found a place
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: But they were having a special night tonight
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt really found a place to work outside of my apt downtown yet
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: So we ended up going upstairs, and eventually got a drink and are still working
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not a big coffee shop worker though
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: And that is all to say "I'm not an alcoholic but..."
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Ooooooh I see
9/17/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: Oh me neither
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: We just wanted somewhere to work
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd prefer a library
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: 100% same
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs understandable
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: But it's hard when they kick you out
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Or I‚Äôm surprisingly productive in my room
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: And well I never work in libs at school really
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a wall girl
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Did Union a little more this past semester
9/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I like union because even if I‚Äôm not sitting with people, I‚Äôm still surrounded by people
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Okay now we're teaching Derek how to use vim
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: A lonely Marianna is NOT a productive Marianna
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Please teach me to
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve used it like 3 times
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Go quote Woo, "the first time I used vim I got so confused I had to shut down my computer"
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Vim is a wonderful wonderful thing
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: I'll gladly teach you
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Yes I‚Äôve heard
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a religion
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: My mom swears by it
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs most of what she does
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: And if I were just a _little_ more tipsy id crank up the flirt
9/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Like at her job
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: But I'll leave it here for now
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: AH

9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: Hmmmm sounds unfair
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: My family is not that cool by most definitions
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: I'm the only tipsy one
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre just cool to me soemtimes and other NERDS
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: And UH TRY AGAIN THATS WRONG
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: I have a glass of wine
9/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: But I also had it over 3 hours
9/17/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm all good

9/17/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Not having anyone to flirt with
9/17/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Actually I have sarah

9/17/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna

9/17/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: I get it
9/17/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Because I said fishy
9/17/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: So im sure you'd have no trouble finding someone to flirt
9/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Oh maybe there wasn‚Äôt a connection there I take it back
9/17/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Aha
9/17/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Maybe there was
9/17/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Maybe there wasn't
9/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Maybe

9/17/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Caleb
9/17/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Shoot
9/17/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: What's something you're afraid of
9/17/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: I feel like I‚Äôve already told you a dozen answers
9/17/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your answer
9/17/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/17/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: But I also feel like you've avoided the most real ones
9/17/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Sorry
9/17/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: That's not what I meant, just disregard it
9/17/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: No I don‚Äôt think I have
9/17/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Maybe
9/17/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: But they all seem real to me
9/17/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah no you're right, I'm sorry, it's not what I meant to say
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay tipsy Caleb
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Just press control z
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Oh wait
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not the command for you is it
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Nope
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: It is now at least
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Okay let's try this again
9/17/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Marianna

9/17/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Why are Irish bankers always so successful?
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Because they are lucky due to the sheer multitude of 4 leaf clovers they eat and roll around in
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Nope
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: There are no other greens
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Their capital is always Dublin
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Just 4 leaf clovers
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: HA
9/17/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: GOOD

9/18/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: Also I am proud of my body it wakes up naturally at like exactly 6:55 everyday now
9/18/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: Well someone's gotta watch out for her, and as long as she's around I'll be happy to do it
9/18/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Also wooohoo just kidding that doesn't sound fun
9/18/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: I usually wake up naturally around 7:30, but can also just wake up and pass out for another hour
9/18/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: Hey that was a one time occurrence I promise
9/18/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: Idk if I can promise it
9/18/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll try
9/18/19, 9:10 AM - Marianna: Yeah I can do that too but not if I have class ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/18/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: Also it is COLD today
9/18/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: Not like cold cold

9/18/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: Right
9/18/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: Well, right now I'm more classless than a communist utopia
9/18/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: So I haven't left bed yet
9/18/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôve definitely already used that line caleb
9/18/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Get new material please
9/18/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm jealous
9/18/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: I wanted bed
9/18/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: But now I‚Äôm on my second class and we didn‚Äôt even get a break in the first one
9/18/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: But it was theory of computation section A for the first time and it was so much better!!!
9/18/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: AH SHIT
9/18/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Yeah I'm a broken record
9/18/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: I even was like "okay I've definitely used this before" and searched it in chat
9/18/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: I'll just stop cracking jokes
9/18/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: That'll solve it
9/18/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: NOOOO
9/18/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: I love your jokes
9/18/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Even the second time? Hot dang
9/18/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Well it didn‚Äôt thrill me like the first time jokes but it‚Äôs fine
9/18/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Well
9/18/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: I need fresh material anyway
9/18/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: But it's hard over text
9/18/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: I'm a very spur-of-the-moment type guy
9/18/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: And usually I say them without thinking about what I'm saying
9/18/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: So when I type them out it's waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much thought for me
9/18/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs okay
9/18/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre doing great sweetie
9/18/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: üòÖ
9/18/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Okay let's talk about something other than my unfunny jokes
9/18/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Otherwise I'll crank up the dad jokes
9/18/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: And I'm not sure you want that
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I do like dad jokes
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I make them too
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: But anyway
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Good
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Have you made it out of bed yet
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Goooooooooooooood
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: I got out of bed
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Showered
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Made breakfast
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Good ol' egg in a hole or whatever it's called
9/18/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Then cleaned the common room in my flat
9/18/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Now I'm procrastinating on work
9/18/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Wow
9/18/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so proud of you
9/18/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/18/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: I put the pro in procrastination
9/18/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Also you switched your profile picture but it‚Äôs FREAKING me out because I‚Äôm always so scared I‚Äôm gonna be texting the wrong person
9/18/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm used to seeing a little orange circle but no more!
9/18/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: I realized I have a good bit due Friday/Saturday that is gonna be fun to do
9/18/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/18/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: A pro-crastinator
9/18/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Look at you
9/18/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Also now that you say this I'm gonna change it ALL the time
9/18/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Jk but the old one didn't really look like me honestly
9/18/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And it was 3 years old I think
9/18/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: So I could definitely use an update
9/18/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Although I guess in this one I have a camera in my face so it doesn't help
9/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Oh, and oh my goodness there was SUCH a cute baby on the metro this morning
9/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: It was just staring at me, so I started making funny faces, and then it started laughing and looking at its mom
9/18/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: And then the mom looked at me mid-funny-face and started laughing
9/18/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: It was wholesome
9/18/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: No you‚Äôre TORTURING ME
9/18/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think mine is from formal
9/18/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: And awww
9/18/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: That wouldn‚Äôt fly in Hungary
9/18/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: People stare at you on the metro but only crazy smile
9/18/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Crazies**
9/18/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: So be glad you‚Äôre in a cheery place
9/18/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Apparently Hungarians are crazy pessimistic
9/18/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Fun
9/18/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Fact
9/18/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Did you know Denmark is the happiest country in the world
9/18/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Oh God my one professor made a really morbid joke about it in like the first class too
9/18/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: Apparently it also had the suicide rate, so he said "yeah well I guess that means the survivors are the happiest?" and everyone just uncomfortably chuckled and looked around
9/18/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/18/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: Wow we are in different countries
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: What
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: Are Hungarians just miserable
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: Les miserable
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: Yes apparently
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: :(
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: How you feeling?
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: They love to talk about how they‚Äôve never won any wars
9/18/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: :((
9/18/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: And you can‚Äôt ask anyone how are they
9/18/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: Because they respond honestly
9/18/19, 1:57 PM - Caleb: I mean honestly I'd have that than a perfunctory "good you?"
9/18/19, 1:57 PM - Caleb: But maybe that's just me
9/18/19, 2:10 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/5K2cBicu96Pf4mrBv3Jojk?si=18fVWY6vQIiyEFrDteLXwg
9/18/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: I love dodie
9/18/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: And I like the good you? Responses soemtimes
9/18/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: Because sometimes I don‚Äôt care for the real answer
9/18/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: And most people I would want the real answer from, I could see right through their good you?
9/18/19, 2:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's fair
9/18/19, 2:12 PM - Caleb: And usually there's a time and place for those discussions
9/18/19, 2:12 PM - Caleb: And bumping into someone in a public place with friends isn't the place
9/18/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: Also, I totally didn't think of it when I sent it, but the song is called "If I'm Being Honest"
9/18/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: Heh what are the odds
9/18/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Would You Be So Kind by dodie

9/18/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt remember how it goes
9/18/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: But I just know I really like it
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: You already sent that to me
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: Oh :(
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: It's okay
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: And yeah I guess that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt want the whole answer when I just use it as a casual greeting
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: I only know that because I liked it a lot
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: Well then yay
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre welcome
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's in my saved songs
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/18/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: And now I'm listening to it again
9/18/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/18/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: Oh man I just realized I can change my emoji skin color
9/18/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: Now I won't look like a Lego man
9/18/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/18/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: Okay nevermind too realistic I don't like
9/18/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: Plus you don‚Äôt have black hair
9/18/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre much more LEGO man
9/18/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: Both literally and metaphorically
9/18/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: Bolth
9/18/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: :)
9/18/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: Oh man it still really messes with me that now I accidentally type bolth sometimes
9/18/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: Why did you do this to me
9/18/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: Cruel
9/18/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: :)
9/18/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs endearing
9/18/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Also man I love my cryptography homework
9/18/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just like puzzles
9/18/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: So cool
9/18/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: You in a break from class?
9/18/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt have class until 4
9/18/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: AH right
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: Today‚Äôs my long day but I have some time to work
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: I was going to say, isn't this the day you get out 6?
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: That's good
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: I feel like I always have trouble getting things done in the morning or between classes
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: Because all I want to do is just relax until class starts again
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: And I want to just sit down and finish everything at once
9/18/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: So what's your homework today?
9/18/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: I mean I have class at 9am everyday except Tuesday when it‚Äôs 11am and both time I have to leave my apt an hour beforehand so I really don‚Äôt get anything done before
9/18/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: And I have crypto due Friday and compbio due Saturday at noon so due Friday basically
9/18/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the paper/test studying?
9/18/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Well
9/18/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: I'm out taking pictures of buildings right now because one of my buildings wasn't actually rococo
9/18/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: But test feels studied for
9/18/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: And the essay is due tomorrow night, but I want to submit a draft tonight
9/18/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: So I'm okay, I just need to calm down
9/18/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Oh this is the architecture paper?
9/18/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Can I see the pictures of the architecture?
9/18/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: don‚Äôt take the time if you‚Äôve got to get your paper down
9/18/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Yeah! The ones today are really great because I didn't have Veev
9/18/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: But I'll send some from the other day
9/18/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: There was one scene I wish I got
9/18/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: It's a bunch of guys, sitting on the steps of the oldest church Copenhagen, playing dice and gambling
9/18/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: It was strangely beautiful
9/18/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: I think street photography is my favorite genre
9/18/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: That and portraits
9/18/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: Okay I actually need to get this done so I'm turning my phone off
9/18/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you tonight!
9/18/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: I like looking at both of those genres but I don‚Äôt do too much of then
9/18/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Okay good luck!  We‚Äôre in the train home and I‚Äôll send you cooking with Marianna updates even if you don‚Äôt get them until later!
9/18/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/18/19, 8:04 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/18/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Oh God
9/18/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: No please
9/18/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Stop I'm already so hungry and can't leave the library
9/18/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: The cleaning guy left and just showed me where to hit the lights when I leave
9/18/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: So looks like I'm here for the long haul
9/18/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll stop
9/18/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: And wow how‚Äôs it going over there?
9/18/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Nah keep it going
9/18/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: I just won't look until I'm done
9/18/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: And it's okay
9/18/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: I'm starting to run out of steam, but have a huge chunk of it done
9/18/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/18/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: And you got this!!!
9/18/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: How long is this paper?
9/18/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: It's like 2000 words max
9/18/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: I'm undershooting that a little
9/18/19, 8:22 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a looooooonf paper
9/18/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/18/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah I really fucked up
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: The original instructions said 200 words for the first section, 300 for the next, then 200 for the final
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: Nah I once wrote a 2000 word essay in one night from 8pm to 2am
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: And got an A soooo
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: And I was like
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: Cool.
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: Then where did the 2000 come from?
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: 700 words to describe four buildings, easy
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: He told us yesterday that it is that format PER BULDING
9/18/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: And we need 4 buildings
9/18/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: So ~2000 words, and I hadn't started
9/18/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: OH
9/18/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/18/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: is that language gap or just like oh I assumed they would assume
9/18/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Neither
9/18/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: It was just poorly worded directions
9/18/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Oh darn
9/18/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: That sucks you‚Äôre paying for it
9/18/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/18/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/18/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: This is the first time I've ever been pretty part minute on a paper
9/18/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: And I even have a whole day left
9/18/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: But it's still super stressful
9/18/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: And I actually got kicked out after all
9/18/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Another guy came and was like "uhhhhh we closed 40 minutes ago"
9/18/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: But he let me take the books I needed even though I'm technically not allowed, as long as I bring them back tomorrow morning
9/18/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: Hey hey hey
9/18/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt say this enough
9/18/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: You got this
9/18/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not gonna tell your ego anything you wouldn‚Äôt want it to hear but you know what I would tell it if I was allowed to not inflate it
9/18/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: But bummer about the library
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I got on the metro and it started going the opposite direction it should have
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Oh God
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre having people over for wine Wednesday soon
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Caleb
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: You need a hug
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: FUCK
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: METRO BROKEN
9/18/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: NONONO
9/18/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Uh HWHAT
9/18/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Like between platforms?
9/18/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Or just can‚Äôt get home?
9/18/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Imagine the randomly shut down half the lines and stations in DC
9/18/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: It's still possible to get home, I just don't quite know how anymore
9/18/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/18/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: I could really cash in on that hug right now git)
9/18/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: Git?
9/18/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: You need a hug from GitHub?
9/18/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Sorry
9/18/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Typo
9/18/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: "hug"
9/18/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Git push commit master --force
9/18/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Or I guess it would be a pull request actually
9/18/19, 9:19 PM - Marianna: Yeah save your pull request
9/18/19, 9:19 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your status over there?  Doing good?  Making your way downtown?
9/18/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm not gonna lie I have zero clue how to actually use githib
9/18/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: And yeah
9/18/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: I almost got on the wrong bus because my app was telling me it was on the other side
9/18/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Oh me too
9/18/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: #fakecskids
9/18/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: But the my intuition kicked in finally and I was like WAIT this is going to the wrong part of town
9/18/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: GOOD job
9/18/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Oh shush you're more real than most of them
9/18/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: But thank you thank you, it made me realize that I'm actually fairly comfortable and capable of getting around on my own now
9/18/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Like, I recognize bus numbers and where they run and which ones I need to take
9/18/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: But anyway this commute is taking an hour when it should have been 10 minutes
9/18/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Also I almost got hit by a bike and juked so hard that I think my foot might be bleeding
9/18/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: Not really I haven‚Äôt worked for google yet
9/18/19, 9:33 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs good!!
9/18/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt gotten the buses yet
9/18/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sorry about the commute and the bike
9/18/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: And I really hope your foot isn‚Äôt bleeding
9/18/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: But how ya doing
9/18/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: It's okay
9/18/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: Google schmoogle
9/18/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: They're kinda evil anyway
9/18/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: I'm doing okay
9/18/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: What about you?
9/18/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôm still gonna apply to them for next summer ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ

9/18/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: It tastes like fruit juice
9/18/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Woah woah woah
9/18/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: I didn't know that
9/18/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: That's cool!

9/18/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I made a list of apps to apply for
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: What's on the list?
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: APPLY TO PENN!
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: No I was saying I have some wine
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Oh

9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Oh gee thanks
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: All mine
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Mine
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Mine
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: :(
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: You're selfish
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: A shellfish
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: No
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I can share
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: A selfish shellfish
9/18/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: :(
9/18/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: So Marianna
9/18/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Where are you applying next year
9/18/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: I'm curious
9/18/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: Yelp, Disney, google, southwest, Apple
9/18/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: Probably more
9/18/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: _probably_
9/18/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Good list though
9/18/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Fun places
9/18/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I'm honestly debating not working at Penn next summer
9/18/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: It would definitely be the best thing for my career, but at the same time I feel like part of me wants to do something more adventurous
9/18/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Naila Mamoon would shoot me though
9/18/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Also, I need your take
9/18/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Do I shower and then keep working
9/18/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Or just finish this, shower after, and go to bed
9/18/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: I just really want to get something
9/18/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Latter
9/18/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: For sure
9/18/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: Don't worry
9/18/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: I'm sure you will
9/18/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: If you can get an interview I'm sure you can land a lot of things
9/18/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: Tons of companies would kill to have an employee with your people skills
9/18/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs the hard part
9/18/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Idk it‚Äôs stressful I don‚Äôt want to think about it yet
9/18/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Now it‚Äôs just fun
9/18/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre playing kings cup
9/18/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Good call good call
9/18/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Wait, you guys are having a party?
9/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Wine Wednesday baby
9/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre making it a thing
9/18/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre succeeding because of the whole ability to drink thing and we‚Äôve done all our homework for tomorrow
9/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: :(
9/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Okay have a fun night
9/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: I probably should turn off my phone again
9/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: WAIT
9/18/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Does this mean I'm going to attend a Wine Wednesday when I'm there
9/18/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: If you make it back here in time
9/18/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: And if the tradition last long enough
9/18/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Love to have you
9/18/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Boys are allowed at wine Wednesday‚Äôs at school so this would be like you‚Äôre only chance
9/18/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I guess they are sometimes permitted but most boys get a little uncomfortable with the shenanigans of wine Wednesday whoops
9/18/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: But good luck with your paper!  I support you from my glass of red wine
9/19/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Alright
9/19/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Midnight
9/19/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: I made good headway
9/19/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: But I emailed him and now am tapping out
9/19/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Me too
9/19/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre probably asleep
9/19/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: But we just got everyone out
9/19/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: So sleep is soon for me too
9/19/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: But hey
9/19/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: I just know you did great today
9/19/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: No matter how many words you got down, I‚Äôm sure the paper is fantastic because I believe in you and your ability to do things
9/19/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: That wasn‚Äôt eloquent but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a math/cs and not English woot
9/19/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna listen to orbit and mentally prepare myself for class in less than 9 hours
9/19/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: Okay sleep tight you are a good one so I hope you get nice and peaceful sleep and don‚Äôt have to be stressed for a bit so this is me saying goodnight!
9/19/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: Oh gosh we had an awful car alarm go off this morning right outside and it would stip for 30 seconds and then come back on and i was just like yo who is causing this what the actual heck are you doing to make the car do this
9/19/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: But anyway good morning
9/19/19, 7:41 AM - Caleb: Good morning!
9/19/19, 7:42 AM - Caleb: Yeah sorry I put the face down last night after I finished
9/19/19, 7:42 AM - Caleb: Out like a light bulb
9/19/19, 7:43 AM - Caleb: But anyway, thank you for the encouragement
9/19/19, 7:43 AM - Caleb: I need to get up because I _technically_ stole a bunch of books from the library, but the guy said it was fine if I just returned them this morning
9/19/19, 7:43 AM - Caleb: So I need to shower and head over there
9/19/19, 7:44 AM - Caleb: It's cruel though
9/19/19, 7:45 AM - Caleb: My bed is so so comfy right now
9/19/19, 7:54 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay I fell asleep soonish after
9/19/19, 7:55 AM - Marianna: Sleep is so nice
9/19/19, 7:55 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah well the bed will be there when you get back but if you don‚Äôt go, I‚Äôm not sure your ability to ever go to that library will be again
9/19/19, 7:55 AM - Marianna: Who even let you leave with the books?
9/19/19, 8:04 AM - Caleb: Idk
9/19/19, 8:04 AM - Caleb: I know what he looked like
9/19/19, 8:04 AM - Caleb: And he wasn't just a cleaning person
9/19/19, 8:04 AM - Caleb: He looked like he had some degree of authority
9/19/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: My plan is to just go back, start working, and grab books from the shelf, and just return the ones I have with the ones I grabbed
9/19/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: Okay
9/19/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: Well that sounds like a good plan
9/19/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: Maybe I should find a library
9/19/19, 8:25 AM - Marianna: Although my issue really is I like listening to music but my headphones hurt my earsies so I like working with music playing out loud so my room or a study room is good
9/19/19, 8:25 AM - Marianna: Today, I‚Äôm just going to go to class, go home, eat lunch, (maybe nap), and then work all afternoon before yoga and after yoga
9/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: Well
9/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: This is the DIS library
9/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: So it's not like I'm stealing from the Danish government
9/19/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: But yeah! You should! I'm sure that you can find a good one in Budapest
9/19/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: Maybe even one with a noisy ground floor so you can play music
9/19/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: And heyyyy sounds like a good plan, kinda fun but still necessary
9/19/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: How did Wine Wednesday go?
9/19/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: And update THE SAME GUY WAS HERE! He was super happy that I got up early to just bring them back
9/19/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: Life is good
9/19/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: All is well
9/19/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: Oh well that‚Äôs better I guess
9/19/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm glad he was there!
9/19/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: Hopefully he‚Äôll maybe let you technically steal books again in the future!
9/19/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: It went well!
9/19/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: But idk when when I have the chance to go to sleep early, I don‚Äôt
9/19/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: Why when**
9/19/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs tortuous
9/19/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: Because I have a good bit due in the next two days
9/19/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: Relatively anyway
9/19/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: And the second crypto problem looks like a doozie
9/19/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: Well
9/19/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: That's an easy question
9/19/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: If you have the chance to sleep early, it means you're not stressed, which means it's the best time for guilt-free fun!
9/19/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: But I totally get what you mean
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Caleb: The only issue is you're too much of a social butterfly
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Caleb: And NOOOO! :(
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Caleb: I hope you get it all done
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Caleb: Can you work with a group on it?
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Oh that makes sense
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: I do like being social
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: And no!
9/19/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs the only prof who doesn‚Äôt want us too
9/19/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: Which is hard because it‚Äôs not like we can just walk over to his office and ask questions
9/19/19, 8:59 AM - Caleb: UUUUUGH WHY DO THEY DO THEY
9/19/19, 8:59 AM - Caleb: That*
9/19/19, 8:59 AM - Caleb: That's awful, I'm sorry
9/19/19, 9:00 AM - Caleb: What's the problem? Is it like a worksheet or is it hand done?
9/19/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs cracking a cipher kind of
9/19/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: Technically it‚Äôs forging the cracked plaintext of an ‚Äúintercepted‚Äù cipher text
9/19/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: Super cool in theory
9/19/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs gonna be guess and check to see how realistic I can make it under the given conditions
9/19/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: Also sounds super impressive
9/19/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: Code breaking sounds fun but frustrating
9/19/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs about where I am
9/19/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: Also do you have to pay to be members and go in all the libraries you go to in Copenhagen?  Because all of the ones I know about it Budapest you do and it‚Äôs a little frustrating
9/19/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Nope! All free
9/19/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: :(
9/19/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Not sure about University of Copenhagen, but all others including the Business school are free
9/19/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: I might see if I can finesse my way into the BME library because technically I‚Äôm a BME student studying at AIT
9/19/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Doooooo iiiiit
9/19/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: And my official student id from the government says I‚Äôm a BME student
9/19/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: See if you can find a grand old library with Gothic architecture, those are my favorite
9/19/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: And there‚Äôs another art one that says it‚Äôs 400huf to get in which is like 2 bucks
9/19/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: There are those
9/19/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: But you have to buy membership for a year
9/19/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: And yeah the membership only costs like $10 but then you can switch it up
9/19/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: A little frustrating
9/19/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: $10?
9/19/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Marianna
9/19/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Please
9/19/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: You're killing me
9/19/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: ALSO
9/19/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/19/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: Yes but it feels dumb to pay for a library
9/19/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: Also then I can‚Äôt go anywhere else
9/19/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: And yay!!!!
9/19/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: Is she looking to be recruited or walk on?
9/19/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: I think she's looking to walk on, but I'm not sure
9/19/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: She just asked about what it's like supporting small D1 teams
9/19/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: But anyway yeah I see the delimma
9/19/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: And I know you can't work in coffee shops
9/19/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: So that basically means your only choice is your apartment, which might get old after a while
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Oh I see
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Idk how walking on works
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: You definitely know more about sports than I do
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Mr cowbell
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah and usually I can but only if my space is clean
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs not always clean
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: I do miss wall
9/19/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: I lived in those study rooms
9/19/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: I just ran into Marion, she's v excited to you to be here
9/19/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: I told her what some of my plans were, and she was like "oh I hope you're fine with me just randomly showing up then"
9/19/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: And I told her that I'll need someone else to come so I'm not third wheeling you and Sarah, so she miiiiiight be coming along
9/19/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Also yes
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: Mr cowbell
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: That me
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: Ding ding
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so excited to be there to see both of you!
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Marianna: And I hope it is fine if she just shows up and joins us....
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: Oh no I'm so good with that
9/19/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: Like I'd love to have her along
9/19/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs coming here in November
9/19/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: I refute you‚Äôre claim that cowbells go ding ding
9/19/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very very pumped
9/19/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: What
9/19/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: What
9/19/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: How do cowbells *not* go ding ding?
9/19/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Holup
9/19/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: But I fight that description of the sound
9/19/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: (also that's super exciting, is she coming down for a weekend?)
9/19/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: hWHAT
9/19/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah!
9/19/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: Okay I guess you‚Äôre more authorized to describe the sound I won‚Äôt fight anymore
9/19/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/19/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: Yeah maybe it's more of a *clank clank*
9/19/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: Sometimes a *thwack thwack*
9/19/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: Maybe *bang bang* if you're feeling risqu√©
9/19/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: _*Bang bang_*
9/19/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: More like it
9/19/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: More like _* bang bang*_ finger guns üëâüòéüëâ
9/19/19, 12:41 PM - Marianna: Wow there mister cowbell
9/19/19, 12:44 PM - Caleb: Yeah haven't seen those babies in a while have ya
9/19/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: How are you
9/19/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs ya day been
9/19/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: How is LIFE
9/19/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Well
9/19/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: I have a canal snail
9/19/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Which is a cinnamon roll but better
9/19/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: I'm happy I saw Marion, because we talked about you coming and now I'm just excited
9/19/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: And I'm about to have my first class of the day!
9/19/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: How are you?
9/19/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: WHAT IS A LIBRARIANS FAVORITE FOOD
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Uhhh
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Hush puppies?
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: OH SO YUMMY
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: no
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: But close
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: SHUSHI
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm eating a ton of tortilla chips
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: I need to do homework
9/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: Okay the chips are going away
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: HA
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Shush-i
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Beautiful
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Also yeah that was absolutely delicious
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Bakeries are the best
9/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Fresh bread? mMMMMM
9/19/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Oh man so in sitting in a coffee shop right now, and there are these two girls sitting next to me. Ones making the other sit there as she goes through pictures of herself her phone and comments on all of them
9/19/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: And the best part is that if I satirized a valley girl, it would STILL pale in comparison
9/19/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: Her friend is obviously very disinterested, but feigning interest to not be rude
9/19/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: This is so incredibly entertaining and I don't know why
9/19/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: It's like a play in real life
9/19/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Oh I feel bad for the first girl
9/19/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Like she‚Äôs making her poor friend do this
9/19/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Are they speaking English?
9/19/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: How much danish do you actually hear in your average day?
9/19/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: Or is it mostly English?
9/19/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: I hear a good bit of Danish every day
9/19/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: I can't eavesdrop, but usually I can figure out contextually
9/19/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: It really depends what district you're in
9/19/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: Because if you hang around campus, you will hear tons of English
9/19/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: And if you're in the touristy squares, that too
9/19/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: But once you leave the old city or start going down some more quiet streets, you get a lot of Danish
9/19/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: I get it a lot when I walk into a store or on the metro, and usually can either roll with it and make affirmative noises, or stick with the bit I know
9/19/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Like the bike shop vid
9/19/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Just wing it
9/19/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the default here besides the tourist traps
9/19/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Not English
9/19/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Magyarul
9/19/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: (Which is Hungarian in Hungarian)
9/19/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Ahaha haha that video is wonderful, I've had professors reference it
9/19/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Woah cool
9/19/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: So authentic
9/19/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Yeah and the country isn‚Äôt Hungary
9/19/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs Magyarorsz√°g
9/19/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: Which means Hungarian-country
9/19/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: Everyone just calls it Hungary because there used to be huns
9/19/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: But no more
9/19/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Okay Marianna
9/19/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Test time
9/19/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Wish me luck bud
9/19/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: You got this
9/19/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: Whoot whoot whoot get pumped
9/19/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: :)
9/19/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/19/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: CUTE
9/19/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Test went well btw
9/19/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: I'll let you know when I get the grade
9/19/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: YAY
9/19/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: time to celebrate surviving these days
9/19/19, 6:54 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm walking home
9/19/19, 6:54 PM - Marianna: And my phone is for sure gonna die
9/19/19, 6:54 PM - Marianna: My battery is just not doing anything anymore
9/19/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: YAY
9/19/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Phone did indeed die
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm home now
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Saw Sarah off for her date
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôm gonna warm me up some leftovers
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: And finish all my hw mwahahaha
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: But good day I think
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Oh man Sarah
9/19/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: I REALLY like the theory class now
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: This sounds like it's getting actually serious
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: I'm happy for her!
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: And that was all I had
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: And ooooo stuffed chicken?
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: She acts like she wants it to be
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: That looked good yesterday
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Too good
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: And he was all like what you have to go in December? already
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: But she likes things with an expiration date?
9/19/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt get it
9/19/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: But go her if she wants to make connections that she‚Äôll know have to end
9/19/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: And actually I think I‚Äôm gonna eat other other chicken
9/19/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: The yogurt feta one
9/19/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs older
9/19/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: And don‚Äôt want to waste food!
9/19/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: I mean, okay good for Hungarian Brian and Sarah but yeah if it works for her works for her
9/19/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Okay I take that back I hope he's better than Brian, but at the same time I didn't ever meet Brian, I'm just guessing he wasn't great because of the Molly association
9/19/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Which is bias and unfair
9/19/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: That is to say
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: I hope Sarah found a nice Hungarian Boy
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Sorry I got interrupted
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Anyway
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Yeah I need to actually get my dicks in a row for cooking next week
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: ...
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: I can't just survive on cheap and easy to make food
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: DUCKS
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: DUCKS IN A ROW
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/19/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: NO WAIT
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Too late
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs said is said
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: ... Marianna there's something you need to know
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Oh god
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: I have multiple dicks
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Ducks***
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even know where they could go and I don‚Äôt want to know
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Secret pets
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: And they refuse to line up
9/19/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre like that
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: I just want a nice family picture with my dUcks
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: But yeah no don‚Äôt compare M√°rk to Brian he‚Äôs so much better
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Also Caleb I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not drunk rn
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Becaus will for sure would be drunk crying rn
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Yeah yeah I realized that, it was more just a situational comparison
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: ... Oh?
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: I made broccoli
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know when I last had broccoli
9/19/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Probably warner
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt steam it enough
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Oh no
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: And I forgot to put butter with it
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs still so good
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Crunchy broccoli
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: And I put salad dressing on it
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: OH yay I'm happy for you
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so happy
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: I thought it was a "I messed up the broccoli" crying
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Not a "oh man I love broccoli" crying
9/19/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: The first one is SO much better
9/19/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: But I hate to give my hot take here
9/19/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Cauliflower > broccoli
9/19/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Oi
9/19/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Get out
9/19/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve actually had a lot of fried cauliflower here and it‚Äôs pretty amazing
9/19/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: If you haven't had bang bang pan-fried cauliflower, you haven't lived
9/19/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
9/19/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Have you ever had Sichuan food
9/19/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know if I have
9/19/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: My mom makes some pretty good stir fry
9/19/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: But usually with broccoli
9/19/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Wait a second you don't like spicy food
9/19/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Nevermind
9/19/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/19/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: How

9/19/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: Wish it was
9/19/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve eaten anything TOO weird in class
9/19/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: I did sometimes how full on lunch during comp org
9/19/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: But Marianna
9/19/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: It's innovative *and* cheese obsessed
9/19/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: Idk if I'm buying this
9/19/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/19/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôve turned on Disney classics and given up on crypto
9/19/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: üëçüëç
9/19/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Honestly
9/19/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Good call
9/19/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/19/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Thoroughly recommended
9/19/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: It was that or scotch
9/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: What classic is on
9/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Oh Marianna
9/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness
9/19/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Are you saying that scotch + a certified Disney classic isn't the ideal night?
9/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Oh I mean classics
9/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Like just songs
9/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: No movies
9/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt get any work down
9/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Done**
9/19/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: With a Disney classic and or scotch
9/19/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: And I REALLY want to get rid of the scotch
9/19/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Joey's scotch?
9/19/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: I may be able to help you out when I get there
9/19/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: But also it will hopefully go better than the last time I drank scotch
9/19/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Yup
9/19/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: And wait what happened last time you drank scotch?  I thought it was with Calvin‚Äôs grandpa?
9/19/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Okay it will probably still be here
9/19/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Also
9/19/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: I bet you haven‚Äôt seen enchanted
9/19/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Like the movie
9/19/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: That is the last time I actually drank scotch
9/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Went okay
9/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: The time I was thinking of was my "bros night" with Matt freshman year and we watched a movie, I ran down the hall yelling "BROS NIGHT" and threw up
9/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Also
9/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: I have
9/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: I think
9/19/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: Maybe
9/19/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: WAIT I HAVE
9/19/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: I remember almost none of it though
9/19/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Happy Working Song - From "Enchanted" / Soundtrack Version by Amy Adams
https://open.spotify.com/track/7G061Oqw7NXFr1NDTpXoI4?si=ABDIXbceSYSk6Oss_WNQlg
9/19/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I feel like this song is you when you need to be optimistic and cleaning or working or something
9/19/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: OOOOH yeah that doesn‚Äôt sound like a stellar night
9/19/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Oh freshmen year
9/19/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/19/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Well I'm packing right now so that's perfect
9/19/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Packing isn‚Äôt work
9/19/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Packing is relieving
9/19/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: and reliving depending on what you‚Äôre packing
9/19/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: #gettingdeep
9/19/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Or
9/19/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: #gettingdelusional
9/19/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: #:(
9/19/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Or #:)
9/19/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Idk
9/19/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm done homework for the day
9/19/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Man I think I am actually glad I‚Äôm not at Davidson I‚Äôve done so little work comparatively
9/19/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: But I guess I‚Äôm doing other work like cooking and running errands and COMUTING
9/19/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/19/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Gotta give it to Davidson
9/19/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Daily inconveniences are generally pretty out of the way
9/19/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: The work is brutal and I overcommit to pretty much everything, but other than that it's absolutely heavenly
9/19/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: You turning in for the night soon?
9/19/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/19/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: To the davidson stuff
9/19/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna shower and then probably sleep
9/19/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: You?
9/19/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry if I stole you from homework time
9/19/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/19/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Talking to you is always a pleasure
9/19/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: I'll take none of that
9/19/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: I'm probably just going finish the reading tomorrow
9/19/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Or not finish it
9/19/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: That sounds like a good deal
9/19/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Oh hey
9/19/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: I meant to tell you
9/19/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Orbit really reminds me of a couple artists, and one that I actually used to fall asleep to
9/19/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: I really like it
9/19/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Okay, I'm gonna go to bed and I'm assuming you already beat me to it, but goodnight!
9/19/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Old Black Rum by Great Big Sea
https://open.spotify.com/track/2UjDbDPakYaokXFAMg95Vq?si=ke5wBcH-SxWG1MPJF2F9MQ
9/19/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Fun song
9/19/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Not asleep yet
9/19/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Just got in bed now
9/19/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Listening to some orbit
9/19/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: I really like it too but thank you for the approval
9/19/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: You can pick a song and send it to me like on Sunday if you want?
9/19/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Or I can just keep sending you my albums if you don‚Äôt want to
9/19/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs fun to hear your music too
9/19/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: But goodnight!
9/20/19, 2:51 AM - Marianna: Update very loud men at the bar outside just woke me up and I‚Äôm ticked
9/20/19, 7:05 AM - Caleb: Hellloooooo
9/20/19, 7:06 AM - Caleb: Wow that's pretty annoying that he woke you up
9/20/19, 7:06 AM - Caleb: I feel like people should have better things to do on a Thursday night then be out until 3, but I guess not
9/20/19, 7:07 AM - Caleb: And sure! I'd love to send you a song, I already had one in mind actually
9/20/19, 7:09 AM - Marianna: Good morning
9/20/19, 7:09 AM - Marianna: :(
9/20/19, 7:09 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt want to school today
9/20/19, 7:09 AM - Marianna: I may not go to the mentor party
9/20/19, 7:09 AM - Marianna: Like I want to
9/20/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: But idk if I‚Äôll be totally done and honestly it is probably better for me to sleep tonight so I can actually do cool things tomorrow
9/20/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: But that will be a later decision
9/20/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: And no I mean Thursdays are normal things
9/20/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: And plus there could still be tourists here and they have NO reason not to
9/20/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: And we went out last Thursday and we out pretty late
9/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: You know
9/20/19, 7:14 AM - Caleb: I think I see why people sometimes don't like tourists then
9/20/19, 7:14 AM - Caleb: But yeah that's all fair
9/20/19, 7:14 AM - Caleb: It just sucks that you have to suffer the consequences for it
9/20/19, 7:16 AM - Caleb: And noooooooo
9/20/19, 7:16 AM - Caleb: :(
9/20/19, 7:16 AM - Caleb: The mentor party!
9/20/19, 7:19 AM - Marianna: Yeah I love the apartment but sometimes the street noise is a lot
9/20/19, 7:20 AM - Marianna: I mean I can probably bet I‚Äôll end up going
9/20/19, 7:20 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm pretty sure it would be smarter in a few ways to stay home
9/20/19, 7:20 AM - Marianna: But I think I should be able to finish homework today
9/20/19, 7:21 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm pretty sure crypt isn‚Äôt totally right but I‚Äôm kind of confused and I emailed the prof and he was confused by my questions so that might just submitted as is
9/20/19, 7:21 AM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/20/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: ALSO

9/20/19, 7:35 AM - Caleb: OOO I should get a hot chocolate
9/20/19, 7:35 AM - Caleb: And I wonder if the supermarket has apple cider or something like it
9/20/19, 7:36 AM - Caleb: If not maybe I can make some!
9/20/19, 7:36 AM - Caleb: (in case you can't tell I love fall)
9/20/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: Hey I already said that!
9/20/19, 7:57 AM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm not
9/20/19, 7:57 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm wearing my new fun green pants
9/20/19, 7:57 AM - Marianna: I may be cold though
9/20/19, 7:57 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll do it for fashion
9/20/19, 7:57 AM - Marianna: (And yes that‚Äôs why I texted you)
9/20/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: Hang on wait what's your source on that
9/20/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: Because the internet said it's the 23
9/20/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: And the internet never lies or something
9/20/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: ...uh
9/20/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: Okay
9/20/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: The little Disney phone game I always play said so
9/20/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: So I assumed
9/20/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: But I am not above saying I was wrong please hold off on all the fall activities I guess
9/20/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: Jokes on you I've already got a sweater on
9/20/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: Fall, ready or not here I come
9/20/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: Get me some pumpkins Marianna
9/20/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: I'm. HYPE.
9/20/19, 8:29 AM - Marianna: I love that
9/20/19, 8:29 AM - Marianna: All those saying
9/20/19, 8:29 AM - Marianna: Sayings**
9/20/19, 8:30 AM - Marianna: I do love pumpkins
9/20/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: I doubt they carve pumpkins here though
9/20/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: :(
9/20/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: Now I miss fall in the US
9/20/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/0O5vv7DY8oGWRbdmhA2D2m?si=npm8qtkBTdSUehMcpSAEcg
9/20/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: Have the leaves started changing color at all up there?
9/20/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: So apparently I totally did the last crypto homework wrong so I have to do it over
9/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: People were talking in class and I was just thinking well I read the problem totally wrong
9/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna blame the fact it was written poorly but it also could just be me because everyone else got it sooooo
9/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: But I should have time to figure it out and submit it in time or we can Home!
9/20/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: Hope**
9/20/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Nope
9/20/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Things are pretty much still in season
9/20/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: I'd give it a week maybe? The weather is consistently mid 50s so I'll let you know
9/20/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: :(
9/20/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: I'm sorry about your crypto homework
9/20/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: Doing things again is the absolute worst, but I hope it makes more sense this time
9/20/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: We have some leaves falling but not really like fall trees yet
9/20/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird
9/20/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Also yeah I‚Äôm just stressed because I have to do that still and the compbio due tomorrow
9/20/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm gonna stay after my afternoon class and just do homework
9/20/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's sort of the same here
9/20/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Like patches are falling off of green trees, but nothing is super colorful or even turning really
9/20/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: And aw, I'm sorry :(
9/20/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: I'm guessing it's a stay-in sort of night for you then?
9/20/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: But the mentor party!
9/20/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so torn
9/20/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: So I think I‚Äôm just gonna stay at school until I can‚Äôt stand being here anymore. Like get my stuff done and then I can do other stuff to feel productive here so I don‚Äôt have to do ANYTHING over the weekend basically
9/20/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the plan as of now
9/20/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Do you know Callie Garst?
9/20/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt believe so why?
9/20/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Is she davidson?
9/20/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Nope BSM
9/20/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Sorry I've been in a flurry to get this ticket
9/20/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Still trying but in I'm in a queue
9/20/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Anyway, that sounds like a good plan
9/20/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: I'm always a huge fan of just frontloading so you can enjoy your life stress free
9/20/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: still don‚Äôt think so
9/20/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt interacted much with them since language school
9/20/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not a huge fan of frontloading
9/20/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: But I know I should be
9/20/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: And it seems doable to do it here while abroad
9/20/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: And oh!  The Gothenburg!
9/20/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: To**
9/20/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: Oh no caleb
9/20/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: I just got the urge to listen to Christmas music
9/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Why was that a "oh no"
9/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: "All I want for Christmas" is a year-long song I'll have you know
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: No
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Also
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Crypto
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Is
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Done
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: And
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Submitted
9/20/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: It was much easier than what I was trying to do
9/20/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: Figures
9/20/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: HOORAAAAAY
9/20/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: You might still have time for the mentor party!
9/20/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Also OH man Sweden is odd now
9/20/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: It's so strange to be around people who are just talking and it's actually intelligible
9/20/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Like, I don't understand a good bit of it, but at the same time they're all making clear, distinct sounds and you can actually tell they're saying words
9/20/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Also, this dad and his little daughter sat down with me on the train and it's absolutely adorable
9/20/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: She keeps pointing at people and saying stuff, and people smile and laugh with her
9/20/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  I‚Äôm gonna stay here until 6 and go home with Sarah
9/20/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: I still have comp bio to do but I think I got most of it
9/20/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: But hey!  Kudos for going to a sane country with a language that is universal!
9/20/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs adorable though
9/20/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Any idea what she‚Äôs saying?
9/20/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: /has she pointed at you yet?
9/20/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: That would freak me out
9/20/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd be like ah what am I
9/20/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: She keeps asking what things are, and her dad just answers them
9/20/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: She did point to me actually! I think she asked what my phone was
9/20/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Oh man I can't overstate how cute this kid is, my hearts about to pop
9/20/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: So curious
9/20/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: So pure
9/20/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: So... blonde?
9/20/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOD ANOTHER SMALL KID JUST CAME ON WITH HIS PARENTS
9/20/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: I'M DYING
9/20/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Caleb
9/20/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: THEY KEEP STARING AT EACH OTHER
9/20/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Forget research
9/20/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Be a elementary school teacher
9/20/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Not many people get this excited over kids doing normal kid stuff
9/20/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: But I guess everyone does accept that they are cute when they do t
9/20/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: So maybe you‚Äôre not that weird
9/20/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah no i don't think you understand
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: All the kids here are absolutely adorable
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: I used to actually teach Sunday school, fun fact
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: And this was my favorite age range
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Because they're so well behaved and genuine
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Really?!
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Yup
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: (About the Sunday school)
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: I believe everything else
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Yup yup
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: I mean I believe it
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Hang on wait
9/20/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: What
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: Just surprises me
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: This is what you decide to call me out on?
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Huh
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: No
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna continue to call you out on earlogrey and Bolth
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs about it I think
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: For now at least
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: Also I think I just got compbio!
9/20/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Well congrats
9/20/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: You called me out on several true things
9/20/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: What's so surprising about me teaching Sunday school?
9/20/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Also heeeeeeyyyy nice work
9/20/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Good job
9/20/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Now go enjoy your weekend
9/20/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: Idk
9/20/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: I just wouldn‚Äôt have imagined it
9/20/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: I guess I wouldn‚Äôt have imagined most of our contemporaries doing it
9/20/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: But a portion must have
9/20/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: So idk
9/20/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Well yeah to be fair I can't imagine many of my contemporaries doing it either
9/20/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: But I think thats more of a personality thing for them
9/20/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: But also I guess if I step back, I'd have a hard time believing it
9/20/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think your personality wouldn‚Äôt work with it
9/20/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: I think you would be a good teacher to little kids
9/20/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: You may totally agree
9/20/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Which is fine I‚Äôve only known you for a little bit
9/20/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: But I feel like you could be a lot more patient with them and help them not only learn but find the joy in learning and discovering new things
9/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: Aw
9/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: Thank you
9/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: That means a lot
9/20/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: Also oh man weird to think about take that back
9/20/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: But yeah I absolutely love kids, especially because they give me a license to just be a goofball with them
9/20/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: Also idk if I've sent you this song already but you should listen to it
9/20/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/5yKUiYcK0Glf9qRVEvX3Nf?si=-NxjpOL8Rom-hHru3h1atw
9/20/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve added it
9/20/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: So probably
9/20/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: Is it actually possible I sent it to you
9/20/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/20/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: She has a tiny backpack
9/20/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: And took out a tiny stuffed animal
9/20/19, 5:38 PM - Caleb: And made it wave at me and it came over and said "hej!"
9/20/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôd better have fuckign waved back caleb
9/20/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: Or we can‚Äôt be friends
9/20/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Waved back?
9/20/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/20/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Please
9/20/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: He came over and I had a nice conversation with him
9/20/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: In Swedish?
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: And what kind of animal was he
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: (I'm just assuming the stuffed animal is a him, I think Knud is a guy name)
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Stuffed pupper
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so adorable
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Aw
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Oh of course
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: A classic stuffed puppet
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: I mean it helps that my Swedish is probably more basic than hers anyway
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Pupper *
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs probably more than I could do in Hungarian
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Actually maybe not
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: But people don‚Äôt do that in trains here
9/20/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Probably not no
9/20/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: We have a weird train culture here
9/20/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll see when you get here
9/20/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: If you can say "hello! How's it going with you? What's your name? Who's this?" and stuff like that, you'd be right up there with me
9/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: You ready
9/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: No googling
9/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs see if I can do this
9/20/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: (Sorry you might not care this is more for me than you :))
9/20/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: ‚ÄúSzia! Hagy vagy? Mi a neved? Ki ez?‚Äù
9/20/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Yup
9/20/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got those questions down
9/20/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: Congratulations
9/20/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: If that was Swedish, you'd be able to talk to this child
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Who now is holding Knud up to the window and looking out it with him
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even know how to say hello in Swedish
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: "hej"
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: AWWW
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: oh you did say that
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Pronounced like hey?
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Like "hey"
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: A real doozie
9/20/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: I know
9/20/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Also
9/20/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: "hagy vagy"
9/20/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: How fun is that to say?
9/20/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/20/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Cut out a little at the end
9/20/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: But yeah
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Also did not know I could send audio messages
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Okay now she's making farting sounds with her mouth
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure what drunk Marianna will do with this information
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Well
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Less aww
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: I guess
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Children are truly an enigma
9/20/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Also yeah
9/20/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Voice messages are great
9/20/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: You can also send them over snapchat
9/20/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: I trust drunk Marianna will use them wisely though
9/20/19, 6:04 PM - Marianna: Are you an imbecile
9/20/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: (That was supposed to sound joking and sarcastic)
9/20/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt trust drunk Marianna to use anything wisely
9/20/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: Have you seen her ride an elevator
9/20/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/20/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Only sometimes?
9/20/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: And no, no I can't say Ive seen drunk Marianna use an elevator
9/20/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Is it much different than normal Marianna uses it?
9/20/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/20/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôve never seen drunk Marianna use an elevator either
9/20/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Because drunk Marianna always decides to take the stairs
9/20/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: (This might be a slight exaggeration but I joke once I stop when drunk, I will not start again so I need to keep moving so it‚Äôs the stairs)
9/20/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: And man I lived on the fourth floor this year
9/20/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: #firstfloorforlife
9/20/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: #wouldntknow
9/20/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: Also
9/20/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: How's it going
9/20/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
9/20/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Compass by Zella Day
https://open.spotify.com/track/6o20dsWQsZjhydaq893DnE?si=yUf3oIdYSPeGTF6q6paKAQ
9/20/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Crappy again
9/20/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Compbio on second thought is not right
9/20/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: :(
9/20/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
9/20/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: It's okay if you don't finish it tonight! It might just be a good call to take a breather and relax
9/20/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Then you can come at it with fresh eyes tomorrow
9/20/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Do you think you'll make it to the mentor party?
9/20/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs due at noon tomorrow
9/20/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm stressed
9/20/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: I want to go home
9/20/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Oh, I'm so sorry
9/20/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: I hope you get to go home soon
9/20/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Have you talked to the professor?
9/20/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: I got it
9/20/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Now helping Sarah get it
9/20/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: Love her but there is always extra homework when we do homework together
9/20/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: But it should be done soon
9/20/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: We are home!
9/20/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: We don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll make it to the mentor party though
9/20/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: But a friend texted they are currently literally the only one there
9/20/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Sooooo
9/20/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: HEYO
9/20/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Look at you go
9/20/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Go you
9/20/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: You have any other plans for the night then?
9/20/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Also, being here makes me so happy
9/20/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: They're like my grandparents
9/20/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: They're so sweet and fun and it's just a relaxing place for me
9/20/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Sarah robin and I have finished a bottle of wine
9/20/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: But I think sleep is where I will be soon
9/20/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: And aw I‚Äôm happy to hear that!
9/20/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: When was the last time you say them?
9/20/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Yey
9/20/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Aleep
9/20/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Sleep
9/20/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Good to hear
9/20/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Lowkey disappointed I won't get drunk texts but hey I'm sure I'll live somehow ;)
9/20/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: And I actually saw them last summer!
9/20/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: It was around August I think?
9/20/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: It was with my whole family though so I didn't get to spend a whole lot of time with them, especially because we went to a few different cities while we were here
9/20/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: And also it's always stressful traveling with family so it kinda takes away from the wholesome experience
9/20/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Sorry :)
9/20/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre planning what we‚Äôre gonna do tomorrow
9/20/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Looks like hiking and baths
9/20/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Which is exciting
9/20/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be happy to not just sleep all day
9/20/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: You went to Sweden last summer?
9/20/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah! We did
9/20/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: We went to Gothenburg, Stockholm, and Link√∂ping which is where my parents used to live
9/20/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: We literally drove across the country
9/20/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: ... A whole 8 hours
9/20/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Woah
9/20/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs insane to thing about
9/20/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Do you all come back over here often?
9/20/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Actually no, that was the first time I'd been to Scandinavia
9/20/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: They'd come to the US before so that's when we would have them
9/20/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Now that I think about it, I guess my family never traveled to Europe together before that
9/20/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/20/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Oh well that‚Äôs still cool
9/20/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: AND OH MY GOSH I GUESS YOU CANT JUST STEAL THAT FOR ME CAN YOU
9/20/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: that‚Äôs so cute
9/20/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Old Pooh is my favorite
9/20/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/20/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: None of this new design stuff
9/20/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: üòçüòçüòç
9/20/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm in bed and I‚Äôve got my pig
9/20/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: It roughly translates to "Nalle Puhs Little Book of Wisdom"
9/20/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Idk if I can steal it for you though, something tells me that it's bad guest etiquette ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/20/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah yeah
9/20/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: And we probably have way too much Pooh memorabilia at home anyway
9/20/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Do you speak Swedish with them or English?
9/20/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah but not _Swedish_ pooh memorabilia...
9/20/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: They speak English with me, but they'll sometimes ask for a translation of words
9/20/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: That is probably try
9/20/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Olof has way better English than Anna
9/20/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: True**
9/20/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: And how do your parents know them again?
9/20/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: They were best friends when they lived here
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: They did pretty much everything together
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Aw that‚Äôs so cute
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs sad they now live in different cities
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: And countries
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Separated by a ‚Äúbig ass lake‚Äù
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Sorry don‚Äôt mean to get sad
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: Dumb pond
9/20/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: How has your day been!
9/20/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: DUMB POND
9/20/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: ^^
9/20/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: But yeah
9/20/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: 'sall good
9/20/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: My days been pretty decent! Class was really long and it was stressful getting a ticket, and then was like 4 hours of travel
9/20/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: But it's TOTALLY worth it
9/20/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: And I'm so happy I'm here
9/20/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: So I'd say, day was pretty gosh darn good
9/20/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: Pardon my French
9/20/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Why was the ticket getting stressful?
9/20/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre in a happy place
9/20/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre so lucky to have something almost like a home with people you‚Äôve known to go to while you‚Äôre here
9/20/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: And um Caleb that language will not be fucking tolerated I hope you understand
9/20/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/20/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: I really am lucky
9/20/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: People kept asking if I was going with friends, and then I said no but I had family friends up here, and then they'd be like "AWWW YOU'RE LUCKY"
9/20/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Indeed
9/20/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Tis a big scary world without people we know and know all about us
9/20/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: It's just nice to sleep in somewhere that feels like _a_ home, even if it's not mine
9/20/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: And also is filled with people that remind me of home
9/20/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: They're like the grandparents I didn't really have
9/20/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Aw yay
9/20/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah the end thing is so true
9/20/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Like me bed in other family members houses is still mine
9/20/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: My room in my moms parents house was great
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: It was a pretty old house so it creaked in the night and had floorboard heating so in the winter, you could hear the dripping and my room was right across from my grandparents so I could always expect my grandmother to say goodnight as the last thing before she went to bed and the first thing in the morning, she‚Äôd wake up and come knock on my door
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Wow good memories
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Getting a little testy over here
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: But teary **
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: I feel like all my best memories have odd sounds with them
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: But with a smile
9/20/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Most of mine are triggered by smell though
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Like there could be sound involved but it doesn‚Äôt trigger the memory
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Like waking up on a snow day to my dogs running across the hardwood floor above my room because they just got in from the snow and were crazy puppos
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: And I can‚Äôt explain the smell
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Oh good crazy puppos
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Or the creaking of the floorboards when I'm trying to sleep at night
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: I miss them for you
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Or the rhythm of the dishwasher above my room
9/20/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: You lived in the basement?
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Eh kinda?
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: I feel like you‚Äôve told me this
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: It's a two story ranch house on a hill
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Okay maybe not the kind of part
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Ohhhh
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: So both stories are technically ground floors
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs whack
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: No offense
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: ... Only a little taken
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: It was great though
9/20/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Just trippy not meaning to be insulting your family home
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: The basement had a kitchenette and was fully furnished
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: And my parents slept upstairs
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: I mean mines a cookie cutter house in a cramped neighborhood so people can shit on that al day long
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: So the basement almost belonged to us
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Where‚Äôd your brothers sleep?
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Did you ever have to share a room with them?
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Also in the basement
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Oh you know it
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs fun
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: First part
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Until I was like 10 or something
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Not second part
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah definitely not
9/20/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs not awful?
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: No it wasn't
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Being the youngest has perks
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: At least not during your teenage years
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: I got the nicest room for the longest
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: I feel like that‚Äôs when people need space
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Ooooooooh you
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Because my brothers grew up and moved away
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: And hey, I didn't have anything as cool as a hot pink room
9/20/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: So don't be _too_ jealous
9/20/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: But mine was also on a corner
9/20/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: So I got all sorts of weather noises constantly
9/20/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Thunder storms were my favorite though
9/20/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: I like weather noises
9/20/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Besides the thunderstorms
9/20/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Which is the most common I guess
9/20/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/20/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Also we‚Äôve only have like 3 days of rain here and I miss It
9/20/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Should rain mon/tues though maybe
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: But when the sun hits the corner on a cold day and you can hear the side panels creaking?
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: üëåüëåüëå
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Oh yes
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: THAT'S amore
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Reminds me of summer naps
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: OH YEAH
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Windows open
9/20/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Lawn freshly mowed
9/20/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: ACHOO
9/20/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: ACHOO
9/20/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: CHOO
9/20/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: AAAAAACHOOO
9/20/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Get out of here with your allergies
9/20/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: That's a wonderful smell and I'm sorry you've never properly enjoyed it
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: No it‚Äôs really not
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Even without the sneezes
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Anyway
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Well
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Let's backtracked then
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: We can at least agree on summer sunlit naps
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: My eyes are getting droopy and I‚Äôm listening to orbit so I think it‚Äôs time for me to sleep
9/20/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: In corner rooms
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: In childhood homes
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Which may or may not be whack
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: *ahem
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: My family joked I was a cat because I would just be found in a patch of sun
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: I agree I‚Äôm on board so far
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: But
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: Gotta sleep so I can hike and bath tomorrow!
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Gotcha
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: I need to sleep too
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: So goodnight caleb!  Im glad you‚Äôre in a place that makes you happy!
9/20/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: My eyes can't focus
9/20/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! I'll talk to you tomorrow, have fun!
9/21/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: GOOOOOD morning
9/21/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: What‚Äôs all the agenda for you tomorrow?
9/21/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Today**
9/21/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Okay maybe I‚Äôm still not too awake
9/21/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: God morgon!
9/21/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: It's a lazy day
9/21/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: I slept in
9/21/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: Hung out with Anna and ate breakfast, just chatted about whatever
9/21/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: I just showered
9/21/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: Now I'm going to go help clean up their church actually, just yard work and cleaning and stuff like that
9/21/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: And then go for a walk in Gothenburg, there's this beautiful stream that runs down a hill and into the town, and it's all sorts of old buildings next to the stream that were old mills and stuff
9/21/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: I'll be sure to take Veev
9/21/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: And then idk, we'll see how we feel
9/21/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: What about you?
9/21/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Lazy days are good
9/21/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I got like 9 hours of sleep last night
9/21/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: But woke up a lot
9/21/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Including at 5am because my body was like okay you‚Äôve got your 6 hours that means it‚Äôs time to get up
9/21/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Stupid body
9/21/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: And yay that sounds exciting!  Sounds like you‚Äôre in for a nice relaxing weekend even if it includes cleaning church‚Äôs yards
9/21/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre currently on the train to go hiking
9/21/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got andiamo and I‚Äôm excited about this hike
9/21/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Also I was thinking about when you were here and trying to plan stuff and there is a lot more than I can fit into the time that I thing you might like to see so if you wanted to, you could just stay the whole week BUT if you do, I may stay at school more so I can do homework without much distraction so at least Monday and Wednesday all day you‚Äôd be on your own to do things but I can definitely plan those days out for you. I also have the rick Steve‚Äôs book that has a few day trips from Budapest if you‚Äôd be interested in doing that. Or, if you want to do what you originally said and go somewhere else, that also works
9/21/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: EVEN if it includes cleaning a church yard?
9/21/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/21/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: I have to tell you something
9/21/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: (I enjoy this)
9/21/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: Gardening is fun, it's a great way to relax and also get something done
9/21/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: And YAY for the hike
9/21/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Take lots of pictures
9/21/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Thats so exciting!
9/21/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: And yeah, about the Monday-Wednesday I really really don't want to get in the way of you doing what you need to do
9/21/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: And I also wanted to go to Vienna for at least a day or two
9/21/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure if I should get an AirBnB for it, or if I should just do day trips and come back to Budapest for the night
9/21/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: But I guess it depends how much work you think you have, and also how involved it is getting there
9/21/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Also, yard work is finished
9/21/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Now I'm having real Swedish Fika with a couple middle aged and elderly swedes
9/21/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Highly recommended
9/21/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Very fun
9/21/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: Caleb
9/21/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre
9/21/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: WHACK
9/21/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: Also I need to hike more I‚Äôm not great at this
9/21/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: Well actually I‚Äôm pretty god
9/21/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: Good**
9/21/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: No heresy today
9/21/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: But we went 1500+ ft elevation change in 1.8 miles
9/21/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: It was so steep and I was not doing too hot
9/21/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: If you want to do Vienna totally feel free to!
9/21/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: I was just saying you don‚Äôt HAVE to
9/21/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: You also can stay in Budapest and just go for a day if you want
9/21/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: But we have friends from here who are staying at a hostel this weekend if you wanted me to see if they‚Äôd recommend and how expensive it was?
9/21/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: Swedish fika?
9/21/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: First of yes maybe a little whack
9/21/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: But good whack
9/21/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: I hope
9/21/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: And well Marianna, I think I can help you out with that next semester if you want
9/21/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: Now that I have a car, I'm absolutely ITCHING for some hiking
9/21/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: And about the Vienna, I'd probably want to do day trips so that I can come back and hang out at least a _little_ with you during those days
9/21/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: And yes! Fika! It's a tiny coffee break that is a huge part of the culture, and you sit down with strangers and get to know them in the middle of the workday
9/21/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: It's just an excuse to meet people you wouldn't otherwise know
9/21/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Good whack
9/21/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: For sure
9/21/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Yay!
9/21/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: And it leveled out after I texted you and I did much better
9/21/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Now we‚Äôre back on the train after stopping for pasties
9/21/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Pastries **
9/21/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Pastries have become such a big part of my life man
9/21/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Works with me!
9/21/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Train tickets are pretty cheap in my opinion. Like today, it was less than $2 each way for us to get an hour out of the city
9/21/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: AND I LOVE that custom
9/21/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: That sounds so wonderful I wish we did it
9/21/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Also, back on the train in Budapest now I‚Äôll send photos when I can!  It was pretty cool overall and I‚Äôd love to tell you about it on our next phone call or maybe just next weekend if we don‚Äôt call this week
9/21/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Okay! Well I'd like to call this week, but I'd also love to hear it in person.
9/21/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: So
9/21/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Bolth?
9/21/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: How long was your hike?
9/21/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Okay dokay
9/21/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Works with me
9/21/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Or knowing us we‚Äôll find other random stuff to talk about on the phone
9/21/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: And a little over 5 miles!
9/21/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/21/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: 100% we'll get sidetracked within 5 minutes
9/21/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Also woah that's pretty good
9/21/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Mine was about 7 kilos? A little shorter I think and it was also flat
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Oh I didn‚Äôt realize you also went hiking today!
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: It was more a nice walk than a hike, especially because Olof doesn't do long things like this anymore so we couldn't do anything too aggressive
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: (Did you tell me am I just a bad listener?)
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: You know
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Ah
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: But all is forgiven if you forgot
9/21/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: You have a lot on your plate :)
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Those of the stats and the map
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: I'll send you pictures when I have internet, they don't have wifi in their house
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: And you can ALMOST see Slovakia on the map
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Oh MA
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna claim you didn‚Äôt
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Man
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: I should really get a fitbit shouldn't I
9/21/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Because I usually don‚Äôt forget things like that I feel like
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not Fitbit
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs my hiking app
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Ahhh this is what I said and we ended up deviating
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt looked at my Fitbit stats yet
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: WALK
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: NOT HIKE
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Looks like we're both wrong so HA
9/21/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: I think I assumed it was a stroll not 7k
9/21/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Uh Marianna 7k is a stroll #2swole2control
9/21/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Oh dear
9/21/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Me no like
9/21/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: #thegrind
9/21/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: #cantstop
9/21/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: #isthisinstagram
9/21/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: #imdoinga5kbtw
9/21/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: #jkitsa7k
9/21/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Okay but for real
9/21/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah it wasn't much of a workout
9/21/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: _The user you have tried to reach has blocked you. Probably because you pretended to be a fitness bro hyping himself up on his Instagram account with his newest promotion of some totally unnecessary ‚Äúfitness‚Äù thing. _
9/21/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: It was just very very nice to be in trees and by a big lake and everything
9/21/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: HA it wasn't italics so I already know I'm not talking to Mr. Whatsapp
9/21/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: But yeah fresh air was incredible
9/21/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: ^^i did put it in italics!
9/21/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Do you not see it?
9/21/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: And Olof can't walk quickly so I basically just ran around and took pictures while they walked ahead
9/21/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: And well that‚Äôs fun!
9/21/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre really gonna have to agree to disagree here
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: I hung back and robin and Sarah just went on and eventually would wait for me to catch up
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Damn
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: But I did ask if I could bring my camera and warned them that it would slow me down sooooooo
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: No fun background or anything
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Embarrassing
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: How do you make a fun background?
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Uh by being a fun person
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Duh
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: And your ‚Äúfun background‚Äù is like a window
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Soooo
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: ....
9/21/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: What kind of person does that make you
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Ablak person
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: (A blank person)
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Because ablak in Hungarian is window
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: _this user has blocked you for insulting their nice photograph of a window in a 15th century castle_
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Did you feel that
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: _he felt that_
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Good
9/21/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: So he knows
9/21/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: .... And aha thank you for that clarification, I was confused about that
9/21/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Anyway from this conversation, three dots > wallpaper
9/21/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: And then pick it
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: I see no theee dots
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: You know what just show me when I see you
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: No more screenshots
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Anyway
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: What are you doing now?
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Well we just got back
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: And Anna is picking up food
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Thai food!
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Olof is laying on the couch reading the paper
9/21/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: And I'm going through photos
9/21/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Oh that food
9/21/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Thai
9/21/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Sarah wants tikka masala this week
9/21/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm gonna try to make tikka masala
9/21/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Although that‚Äôs more Indian right?
9/21/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: This is totally all out of my culinary zone
9/21/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
9/21/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I believe it's time to expand your culinary zone then
9/21/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I absolutely love Tikka Marsala though
9/21/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I used to get it a lot for lunch in Philly at food trucks
9/21/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I'd go with Indian coworkers too, and it was odd because the guy running the truck was mexican
9/21/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: But he did a good job
9/21/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: What are you up to? Still on the train?
9/21/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôll let you know if this one is any good!
9/21/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm scared for it
9/21/19, 5:27 PM - Marianna: Both to make and eat it
9/21/19, 5:27 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs a later problem
9/21/19, 5:27 PM - Marianna: Still on the train!  It‚Äôs about an hour total so we‚Äôll be back in 30 min-ish
9/21/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/21/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: So probably back then
9/21/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: Sorry I was eating dinner

9/21/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: RALLY
9/21/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Pregame with friends
9/21/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Hit the town and make my poor legs hurt even more
9/21/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: What about you?
9/21/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Sorry that was probably more detail than you were asking for
9/21/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: I am a stuffed boi
9/21/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: I had dinner
9/21/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: I had ice cream
9/21/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Now I'm sitting on the porch, drinking tea, and reading
9/21/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: OH I finished Roadside Picnic by the way!
9/21/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Nope
9/21/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: More detail the better
9/21/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Okay not always
9/21/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: There IS such a thing as TMI
9/21/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: And it's not just the thing I live next to
9/21/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: But you're fine
9/21/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: And my plan is to drink tea and relax
9/21/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Thats about it
9/21/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: A little different from your partying
9/21/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Stuffed boi is a good state to be in
9/21/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: (I would make a snail/finite state machine joke here but you haven‚Äôt taken comp org or theory of comp :()
9/21/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Make it anyway and I'll act like I get it
9/21/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: And yay!  Worth the wait and trial to find it?
9/21/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: It's the least I can do for being a fake CS kid
9/21/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Well Idk exactly how to execute it
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: aHA so it's a laziness issue
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: And yeah! It was a decent book
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: But something like is stuffed boi an element of F or just of Q here?  For your sake I hope F or at least your delta says you are close to F
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: I'm glad I read it, even though I wasn't a huge fan
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: It might be a little too esoteric for me
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: That is a little different from partying
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: But also had a straightforward, enjoyable plot
9/21/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Only a little
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: So it was odd
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Well both be drinking liqueda
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm a total party animal as you can tell
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not a word in any language I know
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Oh totally
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Party LION over here
9/21/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Oh u no it

9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Uhhhh
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: I need to start a new life I guess
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: I deleted it for you
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: I no longer see it
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôm gonna try to get it out of my head aswall
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Nope
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Caleb is no more
9/21/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Sorry
9/21/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: ...
9/21/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/21/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: did you‚Äôre mom really just send you that
9/21/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/21/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Yes she did
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm sorry and I‚Äôm here for you in this rough time
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Oh it's okay it was a joke
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs an adjustment I suppose but I guess you‚Äôll get through it
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Yeah I figured
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just continuing
9/21/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: And once again failing on delivery
9/21/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Well thank you for your support in this trying time
9/21/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I suppose it explains why I'm so weird or something
9/21/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Also
9/21/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/21/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Wanna see something that tried to bite me today
9/21/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: I mean yeah
9/21/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: Well I guess as long as it‚Äôs not a pretty Swedish girl
9/21/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: No worries
9/21/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: It's a squiggly boi
9/21/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: Or girl
9/21/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: In which case it would be a cute Swedish girl
9/21/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/21/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt get bitten by snakes OR pretty Swedish girls then
9/21/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs all I ask while you‚Äôre in Sweden
9/21/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Update I don‚Äôt think I am going to get a nap in :(
9/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: You see Marianna
9/21/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: You hit me with an OR gate, so I'm guessing it's fine if I get bitten by a pretty Swedish snake I'm fine?
9/21/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: Oh wait OR gates pass true if both inputs are true, so nevermind it won't hold up in court then
9/21/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: But hello have you met yourself? You have 0 things to worry about with some Swedish version of ishti
9/21/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: And no, I'm sorry about the no nap :(
9/21/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: Pregame time?
9/21/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: Idk I‚Äôve never meet any female Swedish ishtis what do I know
9/21/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: And we‚Äôre still eating dinner
9/21/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I FaceTimed Joey and it was actually kind of nice
9/21/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: Met some of his friends
9/21/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm driiing a a blueberry cider
9/21/19, 9:16 PM - Marianna: Sorry my fingers are tired still
9/21/19, 9:16 PM - Marianna: Drinking**
9/21/19, 9:16 PM - Marianna: A**
9/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Well no worry about the Swedish ishtis
9/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: I think you've got a pretty secure spot right now so I wouldn't sweat it
9/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: And nope
9/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Driiing is a thing now
9/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Sorry
9/21/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: That's the way it be
9/21/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: And I'm glad you got to talk to Joey! How's he doing? Any update on short blond girl?
9/21/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/21/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Then I‚Äôm gonna keep driiing
9/21/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs good!
9/21/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs!  really!  Good!  Friends!  With!  Brooke!
9/21/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: So I didn‚Äôt bring it up
9/21/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: And no but Sarah asked if he‚Äôd been sexiled and he said his roommate had texted him but he was ~elsewhere~
9/21/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: Oh I meant to have the ~
9/21/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: But he joined club sailing
9/21/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: He has a boat obsession
9/21/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs always wanted a friend with a yacht
9/21/19, 9:25 PM - Marianna: So I guess he‚Äôll settle for davidson sailing
9/21/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: Oh no
9/21/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: I've heard so much stuff about Davidson sailing
9/21/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: I've heard it's more drinking than sailing
9/21/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: And also they barely know how to sall
9/21/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: Sail*
9/21/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: But that's coming from Lee Aiken who's a prolific sailor
9/21/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Good for him though
9/21/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Clubs are fun
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never heard anything about them
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Again though
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Donald. Lee. Aiken.
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: So take it with a grain of salt
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: All I know is Marshall on sailing is sketch
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Although I think Lee's dad said the same thing to me
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know Lee
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: OH MAN
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: I love Lee
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: We have established
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Both that
9/21/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: And that I don‚Äôt know him
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: Can I meet your friends in January?
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: No
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Absolutely not
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: Or I guess it doesn‚Äôt have to be January
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: 0 chance sorry
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: Maybe the semester?
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: Okay
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: KIDDING
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Yes
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll just be your secret them
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Yes I'd quite like you to meet my friends
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: I'll even try to get them to behave
9/21/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: I promise
9/21/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: (promise that I'll try, I'm not sure if I can actually tame them)
9/21/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: I think starting with Carl and Lee would be a good call
9/21/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: I think those are the two that would have the best chance of not scaring you off
9/21/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: And also Zelli and Marisa and SARAH BAE
9/21/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: Moral of the story, I'm very excited for you to meet them all in January!
9/21/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah azella and Marisa seem super cool
9/21/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: And so does Sarah
9/21/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: I doubt they are weirer than my friends
9/21/19, 9:37 PM - Caleb: (saray gray)
9/21/19, 9:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah those three are spectacular
9/21/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Also, if you want to know about my friends from high school you can probably ask Ben Heuser about them
9/21/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: And hey, I'll take that challenge. Your friends might be weird too, but my friends are totally a different flavor
9/21/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: And Sam Davis!
9/21/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm really not sure yours can win here
9/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Oh yes
9/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Sam could tell you all about my high school friends
9/21/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: The wild lot of them
9/21/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: And if Hannah was going to be around when you are going to be here, I'm sure she would tell you ALL about middle and high school me and I'd absolutely die inside
9/21/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Oh wait hannah, who lives with Lorraine, and going to Switzerland with your abroad roommate, is the one who is from your town?
9/21/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure I totally put that together
9/21/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: No one knows my high school friends :(
9/21/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: But I really only keep in touch with like 2 people from high school so
9/21/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt use them as an indication of my friends
9/21/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Yes yes, that Hannah
9/21/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: She was a really good friend of mine until like 11th grade
9/21/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: And then we didn't talk for 4 years
9/21/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Or 3 or something
9/21/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: But now we're friends again
9/21/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: Woah wild
9/21/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: You know, when you say it like that, it's really odd how my life is turning into a weird, interconnected network
9/21/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: I used to keep people very separate in my life
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Update we got on the train the wrong way
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: And :(
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: .... Oh
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Solid job
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Good start to the night
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: I fear for what happens when we actually start drinking tonight
9/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
9/21/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: I'm hoping for some exciting drunk voice messages tonight
9/21/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt have enough people to keep them separate in high school
9/21/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: I like small world connections
9/21/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: It makes me feel more at home when people know people I know
9/21/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: Okay maybe
9/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre probably not gonna be exciting
9/21/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: And possibly not intelligible
9/21/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: Update we‚Äôre drinking palinka in the metro to pass the time
9/21/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Well yall are just having a grand old night then
9/21/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: And re:the high school thing, yeah it also helps when you've gone to multiple high schools
9/21/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: That helps with having separate groups
9/21/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: I remember when I had my grad party, I had everyone over and it was ODD
9/21/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: I'm sitting here
9/21/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Drinking tea and eating k√§nekebr√∏d and watching the the Last Night of the Proms with Olof and Anna
9/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: So less exciting
9/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And don't worry don't worry
9/21/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: I won't demand you send me embarrassing voice messages, that's gonna be your prerogative
9/21/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: I'm just always happy to hear from you regardless :)
9/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre playing kings cup again
9/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: And we have new people this time!
9/21/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: OOO
9/21/19, 10:44 PM - Caleb: New friends!
9/21/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Yup!
9/21/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Henry!  Who is joshs roommate
9/21/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: And some girl
9/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Look at you ms. Popular
9/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: So many friends
9/21/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Who we think is sleeping is sleeping with Henry
9/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: OOOOOOOOOOOOSCANDALOUS
9/21/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: But also good for them
9/21/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/21/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs studying in Vienna too
9/21/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs here!  For the weekend!
9/21/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: We actually met them yesterday
9/21/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: But now we‚Äôre drinking with them
9/21/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: That's how you seal the friendship deal
9/21/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Lemme tell ya
9/21/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: We can hope
9/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I guess I've had bad experiences drinking with people recently
9/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: @Michael :(
9/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: But hey
9/21/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: I hope all goes well
9/21/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: And it's still odd we haven't drank together
9/21/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: What if I get to Budapest and am like "nope liver needs a break, not drinking"
9/21/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I like these people
9/21/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: And actually trust some of them
9/21/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: And yeah
9/21/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Well I would like to drink with you
9/21/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Although I like we don‚Äôt have to be drunk to hang out
9/21/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Probably a good sign
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: I no longer need to the confidence of alcohol I guess
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Or do i
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: ~~~~~~~~~<<
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: Hey good to hear that I'm tolerable sober :)))
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: And idk
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: The world may never know
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: That's up to you
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: I've said it before and I'll say it again
9/21/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: BEüëèBOLDüëè
9/21/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: üëèBEüëèYOU
9/21/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Oh you're toasty right now aren't you
9/21/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Toasty?
9/21/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: D r u n k

9/21/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: LITTLE
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Also can be taken to mean as hot but I'll leave that ambiguous
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: BUT ARE YOU GONNA COMPLAIN
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: ha
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: No not me
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Mostly because I think you already know my take here
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: But tanks
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Sorry there Tiger
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Oh my God I hope you're not too drunk to appreciate that pub
9/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Pun*
9/21/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Also
9/21/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
9/21/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: I hate to break this to you
9/21/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: But you're hot

9/21/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Deal with it
9/21/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Also you might want to lighten up on the vodka if you don't know how many
9/21/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Just drink some water for now, you'll keep getting drunker as the night goes on with what you have in you

9/21/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Drink a big ol glass of water
9/21/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Wait 20 minutes

9/21/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm doing great for me
9/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: I'm glad to hear you're doing great
9/21/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Super super happy
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: But just remember, more drunk isn't always more good
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: There's a golden zone in there
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: MORE
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: And you don't want to blaze past the golden zone and throw up
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: DRUNK
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: no throw up
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Yes

9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: I can tell myself pretty well
9/21/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: That last night was extraneous circumstances
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Yeaaaaaaaaaah something like that
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: But still
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: In my life I've throw up three times from drinking
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Doing great
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: You may not get those audio messages
9/21/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: And for exactly 0 of those nights, I had thought I was going to throw up _before_ I was leaning over a toilet
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: But you‚Äôre gonna keep getting these photos
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: I fully support this
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: I mean I was blackout before the throwing up
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: So
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm not now
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Hey man, booze is a fickle mistress
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: I've never been blackout before throwing up
9/21/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: I've debatably never been blackout
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: I have
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: Thanks second semester
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: üëå
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: We love that
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: But not really
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: But maybe a little
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: No
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: Second semester shouldn‚Äôt have happened
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: But it did
9/21/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: And we learned!
9/21/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: It's out of your system
9/21/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: So now we‚Äôre good
9/21/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: I think
9/21/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: EXACTLY
9/21/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Which is nice
9/21/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Also you better know I'm gonna be revisiting this
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: NO
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: First off it should be "re-fucking-futable"
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: just let me like
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Second off it's not refuckingfutable
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Let me live
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: I am
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: But I'm also not gonna let you forget that you're spectacular
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: So TOUGH SHIT
9/21/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: I think it is good I am good
9/21/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: Well I won‚Äôt stop you I guess
9/21/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: But externally I‚Äôm gonna reject it
9/21/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: I want you to hang out with these people when you‚Äôre here
9/21/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: They are cool
9/21/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/21/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Will do
9/21/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Happily
9/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre now playing ers
9/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs leading to more arguments than playing
9/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: And I am out :(
9/21/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Oh well
9/21/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: :(
9/21/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
9/21/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: (use this time to drink water and do yourself a favor)
9/21/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Also, I know you're partly joking about this and partly just trying to be humble, but I really do think you're pretty gosh darn great. You should see the dumb grin on my fave when I show people a picture of you and how they react, it absolutely makes my day because they know you're gorgeous, and I know you're gorgeous, and I know they know you're gorgeous, so I get to a have a little moment where I'm like "hey look at her isn't she pretty and let me tell you about her and make you a little jealous" because I'm kind of a dick like that and enjoy showing you off even though I don't really have a right to
9/21/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: But anyway
9/21/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: That was a super ballsy text and I'm gonna go to bed now to avoid having to wait for a response
9/21/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: So goodnight! Have fun and be safe, I'll talk to you tomorrow
9/21/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm too drunk to properaly respond
9/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Mostly because I wouldn‚Äôt know how to respond sober
9/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Becaus euoure too sweet to me
9/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: And I do like hearing things like that from me but I just don‚Äôt know how to be like yeah gosh thanks
9/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Besides saying nah bro
9/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: But I like it
9/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: And I enjoy talking about you too to people
9/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: I need to get photos with you though so I can show you off
9/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: And you‚Äôre not a dick like that come on
9/21/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre the sweetest
9/21/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: But goodnight
9/21/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll keep ya updated
9/21/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I would like to get drunk with you next weekend or when you‚Äôre here
9/21/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: We don‚Äôt have to because we don‚Äôt have to be drunk it‚Äôs not good to have to be drunk with someone
9/21/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: But I think it‚Äôd be fun
9/21/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: And drunk Marianna is vvvvvv ballsy when drunk and in person
9/21/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôd like it
9/21/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: But idk she might just not be great at drunk flirty
9/21/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: But I swear I‚Äôm better in. Person
9/21/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: I hope I can proof that to you
9/21/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: With a formal proof of coursew
9/21/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: With arguments and formulas and figures
9/21/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Sorry that‚Äôs too many texts I‚Äôll hold off until I want to send audio messages
9/21/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: I also promise to properly respond to you‚Äôre text on the morning when I‚Äôm sober because again your too we‚Äôre
9/22/19, 1:05 AM - Marianna: Hi so more updates
9/22/19, 1:05 AM - Marianna: I am home. Getting home was an adventure but I‚Äôll tell you about it later
9/22/19, 1:06 AM - Marianna: Also I want to tell you how awesome you are but my fingers and Brian are tired so I‚Äôm gonna make some couscous and then send you that promises audio message but it‚Äôs gonna be long and I don‚Äôt want it to be saved so I wa gonna use snap but then I remember you phone not good at snap so I‚Äôll do it here. Just for you. You‚Äôre welcome lover boy
9/22/19, 1:23 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 1:23 AM - Marianna: Oh it doesn‚Äôt let me do versions
9/22/19, 1:23 AM - Marianna: Darn
9/22/19, 1:28 AM - Marianna: Well moral of the story is you‚Äôre pretty gosh darn great yourself and I cannot wait to essentially spend the next 2-3 weekends with you and I‚Äôm so lucky to have met you last spring (lol thanks zombie game) and also even though I told you I didn‚Äôt actually swipe on your, I would have. And I had actually seen your card in tinder before zombies but I was scared to swipe because of soemthing maybe intuition because tinder wasn‚Äôt real to me and you were but then I met you during zombies and even tough you don‚Äôt remember it I do and I think that‚Äôs why I was like yeah I can say yes to going on a date with you and man I am so glad I did everything in my brain was screaming no but now my brain knows it was just scared and you are a phenomenal thing in my little life and did I already say you were sweet and too considerate and just good and yeah goodnight cuties I‚Äôll talk to ya tomorrow and also I do not claim Andy accountableity to what‚Äôs I‚Äôve said because I‚Äôm half asleep and more than half drunk üòò
9/22/19, 1:28 AM - Marianna: To be clear I never swiped left I just did the trick to shuffle the deck so I didn‚Äôt have to decide
9/22/19, 1:29 AM - Marianna: I hate rereading these texts
9/22/19, 1:29 AM - Marianna: I need to stop you‚Äôre gonna have like a billion notifications when you wake up
9/22/19, 1:29 AM - Marianna: GOOD night for now and god morgen to when you get to attempt to read this lot of gibnierish
9/22/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: Hey good morning!
9/22/19, 8:27 AM - Caleb: First off, you're very sweet and I totally get that you totally just might now know how to react, to be honest I don't think I would either
9/22/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: Bur hey, the truth it the truth and I ain't no liar ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/22/19, 8:30 AM - Caleb: Second, I'll happily get drunk with you
9/22/19, 8:30 AM - Caleb: We can pregame going out in my apartment if the remaining flatmates are cool with it
9/22/19, 8:31 AM - Caleb: If not, I'm sure Marion would be good with it, but it might be a little crowded
9/22/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: And BRIAN
9/22/19, 8:42 AM - Caleb: Thank you for this absolute gem btw
9/22/19, 8:42 AM - Caleb: You're adorable
9/22/19, 8:43 AM - Caleb: It might hurt for you to listen to, but it really gave me a good laugh this morning hahaha
9/22/19, 8:48 AM - Caleb: Honestly that applies to basically everything you sent
9/22/19, 8:49 AM - Caleb: Don't read it and stress about it, I got it and had a big smile on my face, so thank you
9/22/19, 8:49 AM - Caleb: Typos, Brian, voice message and all
9/22/19, 10:48 AM - Marianna: So what I‚Äôm hearing is I should be a comedian
9/22/19, 10:48 AM - Marianna: Gooooood morning
9/22/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: I really hate being tired and not wanting to get out of bed and technically I don‚Äôt think I have any homework due tomorrow but I want to DO something today
9/22/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: And yeah I am never going to listen to that audio message I don‚Äôt know what I said and I don‚Äôt want to know
9/22/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: But anywho how has the waking world been?  You got up early
9/22/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: Also!  Re: the girl you know who‚Äôs applying to davidson. You can ‚Äúrecommend a wildcat‚Äù and like write a message to the admissions dept using that form why she should fit in at davidosn and be a good addition to campus if you know her well enough to do that!
9/22/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Okay that's actually awesome I need to do that
9/22/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: That's what I've been up to
9/22/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: It's Lutheran so I wasn't familiar with the liturgy
9/22/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: And also in Swedish
9/22/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: So communion was nerve wracking
9/22/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: And now we're visiting their son and his wife and having coffee with them
9/22/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: You are having such a wholesome day I love it
9/22/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I are making lists of everything we want to see in Budapest and man it is so much
9/22/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: We're hanging out, having Fika, and watching rugby now
9/22/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Also, I was wondering, are you going to church on Sunday when I'm there?
9/22/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: If so I'd love to come along
9/22/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Also completely related but do they have you singing yet?
9/22/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: THEY MADE ME A BIRTHDAY CAKE!
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Sorry sarah and I have been trip planning for literally the last 3 hours
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: And we‚Äôre not done yet and not I‚Äôm late for church
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: And no I decided not to do the choir because practice is 4 hours every weekend and I want to be able to do things around Budapest on the weekends I‚Äôm here and not have to have my days split up
9/22/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: And now I‚Äôm realizing my data plan ran out so you won‚Äôt get any of these till I get back to my apartment
9/22/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Aha
9/22/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: So you ARE alive!
9/22/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Good to hear
9/22/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: How's your day been?
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: AW SO CURE
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: CUTE**
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: Yeah just got back from church
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: Now I need to find an open vodaphone
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: And some herbs
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: And ginger
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna be an adventure
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: And my phone is on 5 percent
9/22/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre doing great
9/22/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: You got this
9/22/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I believe in you
9/22/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think Sarah and I live all that well together because I think we both expected we‚Äôd spend all of our time together but we spend time doing different things so it‚Äôs always kind of like AH okay you do that I‚Äôm gonna do what I want to do and it feels almost like snippy but it‚Äôs not
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Like she wanted to go do homework in a coffee shop and I was like uh no I can‚Äôt work like that and she was like what and I kind of like when she‚Äôs home when I cook because then she can help or at least read the instructions to me but she wants to spend a few hours at the coffee shop and kind of expects me to find the remaining ingredients we need and cook dinner for when she gets home
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: But whatever
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Just learning
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: But low key I miss audrey
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: They're good things to know about your best friend
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry you went in with such high expectations though
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: And Audrey :(
9/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: :(((
9/22/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: If yous don't live together senior year, I WILL cry
9/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I really thought it would be perfect
9/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: But idk
9/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: We didn‚Äôt spend a great deal of hours together expect for working in the makerspace and class
9/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: But other than that , we always did things separately and it was great
9/22/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: I know I want it to happen so badly and I‚Äôm pretty sure she does too
9/22/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: YAY
9/22/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: But about Sarah, I'm guessing she feels that way too?
9/22/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: It's just a shame you guys have kinda incomparable lifestyles like that
9/22/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: It's great you get along to live together, but if you're looking for someone to do everything with, that's a tough thing to have to get past
9/22/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: I assume so
9/22/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Especially because it pretty much means that one of you will have to compromise until you both find something you love
9/22/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: Yeah I just feel like it‚Äôs awkward because if she was a rando I could do whatever but I want to do things with her but we have different ideas of how to spend our time
9/22/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: But whatever I don‚Äôt want to talk about this
9/22/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: Or think about it but it‚Äôs hard not to
9/22/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: So tell me how Sweden has been today please!
9/22/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Okay, but if you ever just want to vent just let me know
9/22/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Also, if you ever just want me to shut up and listen to you, please let me know
9/22/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: I don't want to make you talk about it or offer unsolicited advice, so if you just want me to quietly listen, I'll be super happy to
9/22/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: But annnnywah
9/22/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Sweden!
9/22/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: It was SUCH a wonderful day
9/22/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: We got up, had breakfast on the porch
9/22/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: It felt like a cool summer day so we spent a lot of time outside
9/22/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Like mid 70s probably?
9/22/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: But then we went to this beautiful old Lutheran church, and the service was great
9/22/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: I was having a hard time understanding the sermon, but the music was really good
9/22/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: I like all the moody kyries
9/22/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: And I could understand and sing most of the songs! It helps that a lot of them are translations of English hymns, so it gave me a dictionary of religious words I could use for the call and responses
9/22/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: But we got out of that, drove into Gothenburg and had coffee and watched rugby with their son Jonathan
9/22/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: And then after halftime we left and went for a walk by the river which is called the "G√∂ta √§lv"
9/22/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: And it's the town Olof actually grew up in, so he was telling me about what it was like when he was a kid
9/22/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: And it was cool because I was remembering the city a good bit from the last time I was there, so it all felt a bit familiar
9/22/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: But then we went back, had fresh fish from the market, and after dinner I went downstairs to go to the bathroom, but then I come back and there's a cake and a birthday present!
9/22/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: The cake was some Swedish specialty cake with apples and white chocolate, and it had hazelnuts on top
9/22/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: But then we cleaned, I packed, and said goodbye
9/22/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: And here I am
9/22/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: On the train back
9/22/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Sorry I‚Äôve been running around figuring my phone out and trying to find spices in a GIANT TESCO
9/22/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: That sounds like a lovely day
9/22/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so great hearing people talk about where theyre from and being able to actually SHOW you is even better
9/22/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: And man that cake sounds amazing
9/22/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: And also re: church here-I hadn‚Äôt actually decided because usually when people visit or I‚Äôm with people somewhere that I‚Äôm the only person who would want to I just don‚Äôt but the baszilika is also just a beautiful building so I think you‚Äôd probably still want to see it maybe. So if you want to go to church, was can go to church but if you just want to see it and not spend an hour saying things you don‚Äôt believe or totally understand I totally get that catholic masses are kind of intense but I like them so just let me know what you‚Äôd want
9/22/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Alright, that sounds good
9/22/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: And yeah it's always great actually _seeing_ where someone lives, it's like we talked about a long time ago about how it's way different hearing "oh yeah I got back" after we'd visited each other's apartments
9/22/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: And re:re: the church, yeah I mean I'll be honest I have 0 idea what catholic mass is actually like, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious
9/22/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: Idk though it sounds kinda like I'd stick out a good bit and would have no idea what to do, so if that's the case, maybe it would best if we just checked the church out
9/22/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: But also, I feel like if it's something that's important to you over there, I really want to see and experience it
9/22/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: But anyway, you get your phone stuff all figured out? What are you up to for the rest of the night?
9/22/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Oh true
9/22/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôll get to see your new ‚Äúhome‚Äù in a week!
9/22/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: And then you‚Äôll get to see mine!
9/22/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah honestly though it kind of amuses me when I bring people to church because they have no idea what‚Äôs going on
9/22/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: At least it‚Äôs in English
9/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: And they have the mass parts on a handout for everyweek if we can get there early enough to grab one but obviously you don‚Äôt have to say any of it if you don‚Äôt want to. And my church at home is much more important to me than the one here actually so I wouldn‚Äôt totally be heartbroken if you didnt want to go
9/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Yup!  Oh the metro on the way home and then cooking and finishing fall break planning
9/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre just heading down here
9/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: AND I‚Äôm planning what you‚Äôre gonna see in Budapest
9/22/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: You can thank me later
9/22/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: And I should probably look at a few applications and I‚Äôll also probably FaceTime my parents
9/22/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Also I just really enjoy walking at night I thin
9/22/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Think**
9/22/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Especially in cities. I think it‚Äôs part of the whole I like being with people even if we‚Äôre not talking like just having others and motion and action all around is so weirdly comforting and at night it can get quite and ah yes I like it so much but it‚Äôs probably not the safest habit to form
9/22/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Oh I totally know what you're saying
9/22/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: There's something so calm in the middle of chaos
9/22/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: It's just weird because they usually turn into entirely different cities once the sun sets
9/22/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Don't you feel nervous out though? I feel like if I was a girl, I probably be a bit on edge
9/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure about the entirely different cities
9/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Just everything seems quieter at night
9/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Even my courtyard
9/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs saying something
9/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Not so much here
9/22/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: In dc? Oh all the time. Even during the day. Even walking the few blocks to Betsy‚Äôs. But here, the only people who have bothered me have been drunk Scotsmen and harmless and honestly a little amusing
9/22/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: I mean there were also the guys that straight up propositioned you and your friends for sex, but I mean if you feel safe then I'm really happy for you there
9/22/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Budapest sounds like a wild, wonderful city
9/22/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: I feel like sometimes I have trouble envisioning exactly what it's like
9/22/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah but they were very polite and timid about it
9/22/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Yeah well you‚Äôll just have to see for yourself
9/22/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt really know what I could compare it to
9/22/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: But I really like it
9/22/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I get sad like I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be back here after December
9/22/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Update I got home and my head hurts and I‚Äôm so tired and don‚Äôt want to cook. I‚Äôm gonna drink tea and hype myself up for this chicken paprikash
9/22/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh okay, yeah that's not the picture I had but I'm glad I was wrong
9/22/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Also, lucky you being home
9/22/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: I think I've got another 40 minutes probably?
9/22/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: I just got back into Denmark though
9/22/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Or I think I'm about to actually, I'm in Malm√∂ right now
9/22/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: So it's just across a bridge and 3 stops, then board another train and take it to the metro, then take the metro to my station and it's like a 6 minute walk.
9/22/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: ... Maybe I should just take a bus
9/22/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: But I'm sorry about the headache :(
9/22/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Do you have homework, or can you just sleep soon?
9/22/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: Oof I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre not home
9/22/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: But just think how nice it will be to get back and fall into your bed
9/22/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: And no homework due tomorrow
9/22/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I need to finish the proposal for fall break and I should look at homework or apps or something
9/22/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: But I also like sleep
9/22/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: So I guess I best start cooking
9/22/19, 8:15 PM - Caleb: Indeed
9/22/19, 8:16 PM - Caleb: What's on cooking with Marianna tonight?
9/22/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: Okay update officially back in Cope now
9/22/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: And yay welcome back!
9/22/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs my first time trying a Hungarian dish
9/22/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm excited and pretty nervous
9/22/19, 8:45 PM - Caleb: It will work out
9/22/19, 8:45 PM - Caleb: Have faith
9/22/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: I believe in your cooking skills
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: Also, so I've given a good bit of thought and think I have new music that we could add to the schlep album, but you also said you had an album you wanted
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I had one in mind for this week so shoot!
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: And thank you
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: You said song when you asked me
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: I kind of just wing it but know how to wing it with the least likelihood of failure from experience I guess
9/22/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: But did you mean song, or did you mean album
9/22/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Oh no album
9/22/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I usually can‚Äôt fall asleep that fast
9/22/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I really do think falling asleep to a consistent thing really helped last week
9/22/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Ah really?
9/22/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: I just kept getting directed by how much I liked it and how much she sounded like Joanna Newsom
9/22/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: And then I'd get distracted because I'd start thinking about how Joanna Newsom is married to Andy Samberg and I'm like WHAT they're polar opposites!
9/22/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Okay that actually only happened once
9/22/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: Oh right the album
9/22/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Okay now I'm second guessing the album nevermind
9/22/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/22/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: How bout you send it
9/22/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: I will give honest feedback
9/22/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: And wow no I like falling asleep to music but I need to not be too distracting
9/22/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Have I fallen asleep to my f playlist?  Yes for sure but that‚Äôs besides the point
9/22/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: (I always wake up at like 3 am and I‚Äôm like why is fire burning playing)
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Oh wow I just discovered you can see people on Spotify
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: ... See people?
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Is it okay if I follow you and see what you‚Äôre listening to?  You can 100% say no
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: Like what they're listening to?
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah!
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never had that
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: But under one condition
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Sarah can see me but I can‚Äôt see her :(
9/22/19, 9:10 PM - Caleb: Okay two
9/22/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: 1) sorry I always go back to the same albums dont judge me
9/22/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: And 2) I can follow you back!
9/22/19, 9:11 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/user/grenkoca?si=BiZ_vzakQAqCojyJO0_SQA
9/22/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: Sure!
9/22/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: And come on I listen to one playlist of pretty random songs for an entire month
9/22/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: And okay about the album I was gonna send
9/22/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: The only thing is that for the most part it's really soothing but there's like one or two random songs that kinda wake me up
9/22/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: It's what I used to fall asleep to in high school actually
9/22/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Or one of the two that I'd play back to back
9/22/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/album/087H314gyrs75qC1KESmCp?si=-MMSauDvRi-rwdR1gkYyMw
9/22/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: Okay there it is, its actually from a much larger album but I think that would be too long to listen to
9/22/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Okay!  I‚Äôll try it out
9/22/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Well it always continues playing for me past when I fall asleep
9/22/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Idk do you think I fall asleep quickly?  Maybe you haven‚Äôt had enough time to think about it but I don‚Äôt think I do usually
9/22/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: And photos from yesterday!
9/22/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Well in my limited experience, I think you've fallen asleep before me every time
9/22/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: But I also guess in those cases I'm too excited to sleep sometimes
9/22/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Hello you!
9/22/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Oof @ the mountains thing
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: The Danes feel the same way honestly
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: "The only thing we're good at is losing land and wars" --My professor, Morten
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: These poor mountainless countries
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: NO THATS US
9/22/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: :(
9/22/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: we should start a support group for small europe countries that has no mountains and has lost everything they‚Äôve fought in
9/22/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Thats the tallest mountain in denmark
9/22/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: I just want that to sink in
9/22/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: oh hey
9/22/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: I owe you some pictures from my weekend, don't I?
9/22/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Oh well we might have you beat on the tallest mountain actually then
9/22/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Yes please!
9/22/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: But first
9/22/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Have you sent all yours?
9/22/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: I don't want to interrupt
9/22/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: I loved those pictures though
9/22/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Especially the flower one
9/22/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

9/22/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: I feel like I need to give commentary on some of these
9/22/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Basically, we walked 8km around a big lake thats literally named "little lake"
9/22/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Go for it!
9/22/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: A lot of it is just that I thought the vegetation looks really cool-- its a lot of birch forests which looks really unique
9/22/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Lots of tall standing, straight, white trees against the mossy green background
9/22/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Theres also a lot of mushrooms and creeks running through it
9/22/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And the sunlight really is beautiful, it reflected off the ground and made the moss glow
9/22/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: The little red houses and cabins in the woods are adorable
9/22/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: They're painted red because this region in Sweden was known for a long time for mining copper, so they used it as a pigment which killed fungi to protect their wooden houses
9/22/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: So now its a super traditional, adorable look
9/22/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: The indoor pictures are from a "Stuga", which is a specific name for a tiny waterside cabin
9/22/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: I love super specific words
9/22/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: But anyway, we sat in there, and it was just so peaceful
9/22/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: There were also people riding horses and taking kayaks/canoes out, so it was just fun to be outside and seeing everyone enjoy the weather one last time
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: So what I‚Äôm hearing if you want to spend your whole life in that town
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: I love little stories like that
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Like the copper thing
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Like if you weren‚Äôt told by a local, you‚Äôd never have known
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: ... Yes a little
9/22/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: I love the glowy look of the moss too
9/22/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Everything you said about the foliage is so true
9/22/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: And cute picture of yourself you snuck in there
9/22/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Thinking I wouldn‚Äôt notice
9/22/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: You forget I can be absurdly observant sometimes
9/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/22/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Sherlock Holmes over here
9/22/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: And that's all to say thank you, I'm blushing a little bit
9/22/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Oh wow you recovered a shocking amount of data from that image
9/22/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Good job
9/22/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Thank ya thank ya
9/22/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Shooting in raw has its perks
9/22/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: It doesn't _just_ fill up my memory card in like 4 days
9/22/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt shoot in raw
9/22/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: Also because I don‚Äôt like editing photos
9/22/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs the best of both worlds
9/22/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/22/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm sorta spamming you
9/22/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs okay
9/22/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Remember I like photos
9/22/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Oh right
9/22/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs kind of like my thing
9/22/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: ms. basically got me to buy this camera
9/22/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Okay ms. ‚Öì the reason I got this camera
9/22/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: I blame you, Spyros, and Calvin
9/22/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Actually Calvin gets negative points, he basically said it's hard to compete with my phone unless I spend a stupid amount of money
9/22/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/22/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre POSITIVE influences I think
9/22/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll thank me later
9/22/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Or now
9/22/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I suspect you‚Äôre asleep so I‚Äôm gonna try out your album and head to sleep myself. Goodnight and I‚Äôll talk to ya tomorrow!
9/22/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Sorry I was talking to my parents
9/22/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I'm also waiting got laundry to finish so I can pull it out
9/22/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: But
9/22/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: I'm tired
9/22/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: And will also throw on that album
9/22/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: Let me know what you think of it!
9/23/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: I hope laundry didn‚Äôt keek you up too late
9/23/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: Wow I really don‚Äôt want to get up today
9/23/19, 7:21 AM - Marianna: But I like the album!  You‚Äôve sent me atlas before and some of them are in my cozy playlist so good choice
9/23/19, 8:03 AM - Caleb: I'm too cozy
9/23/19, 8:03 AM - Caleb: Help
9/23/19, 8:03 AM - Caleb: And I was up until like 1
9/23/19, 8:03 AM - Caleb: But I don't have class for a good bit so it's all good
9/23/19, 8:04 AM - Caleb: And yeah! I'm glad you liked it
9/23/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Then sleep!
9/23/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm running to get to class
9/23/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Probably stayed in bed a minute too late
9/23/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm switching it up this morning and got a maln√°s croissant (raspberry)
9/23/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm pumped to make it to 11am to eat it
9/23/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: MY LATE CLASS IS CANCELED
9/23/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: WOOOO
9/23/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: BEING DONE AT LIKE 2:30 INSTEAD OF 6
9/23/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: WOOOOOOOOOOO
9/23/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: Also sorry I've been scrambling for visa stuff
9/23/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: The Chinese government wants to know a ton of information about me
9/23/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: I wouldn't be surprised if they ask what my dogs' favorite ice creams are
9/23/19, 11:45 AM - Caleb: It's gonna be like the last question
9/23/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: WELL YAY ABOUT THE CLASS
9/23/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: and boo about the Chinese government giving you the fifth degree
9/23/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: I think that‚Äôs the saying
9/23/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all though
9/23/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: But you know it‚Äôs probably still easier than a visa for the us
9/23/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/23/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/23/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: I've messed up just a lil bit
9/23/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: That smiley face makes me uncomfortable and I don't know how to read it
9/23/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Oh well
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Oooooooooooooooooohhhhh well
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: You're right
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: It also doesn't help that I've had too much coffee
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Maybe he means he things you‚Äôre great
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm gonna read it
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: No such thing
9/23/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And it makes me more energetic and focused, but also a lot more anxious
9/23/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And I feel guilty because after the stressful week I was like FUCK IT not dealing with anything until next week
9/23/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And now I'm dealing with it and just wishing I didn't wait so long
9/23/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: Ah me too
9/23/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: I have so much homework due int he next 6 days
9/23/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs great!
9/23/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt do anything over the weekend
9/23/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: But hey man you got this
9/23/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/23/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: This week I have a plan
9/23/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: And it's to leverage my stress to try to power through EVERYTHING
9/23/19, 1:14 PM - Caleb: Then I have a freeish weekend and am less stressed
9/23/19, 1:14 PM - Caleb: (hopefully)
9/23/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: Uh you don‚Äôt have a super free weekend
9/23/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre gonna be super touristy
9/23/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: :)
9/23/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: I need a plan
9/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Also AW yeah for this weekend
9/23/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: I still need to figure out if I can get out of this Saturday class commitment, but worst case scenario is that I can plan a bunch of things for you and Sarah with Marion and Margaux, and I'll just join up later and then we have Friday night, a good chunk of Saturday, and Sunday
9/23/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: I just want you to be aware that that's a possibility as disappointing as it probably is for both of us, but I still want you to have the most fun you can this weekend
9/23/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I would have gone and just done touristy things while they were all stoned out of their minds
9/23/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: But Sarah and I are going to be there for Halloween!
9/23/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: I will personally write a letter to this professor as to how wrong it is to keep you for a Saturday
9/23/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Actually no, it‚Äôs fine if you can‚Äôt get out of it I don‚Äôt mean to make you feel bad but it just kind of sucks
9/23/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sure I will survive exploring Copenhagen on my own
9/23/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: :(
9/23/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: I feel like it's unreasonable of him to make us spend most of a Saturday doing this
9/23/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: And I'm kinda just wondering what the consequences would be if I was like "sorry prior commitments"
9/23/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Also
9/23/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: I could use some input from Marion/Margaux/Sarah about what they want to do
9/23/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: I have a bunch of ideas, but I guess I'm not really sure how you want this weekend to look
9/23/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/23/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Sarah hasn‚Äôt really looked at anything
9/23/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Aaaaaalllllllllllllll good
9/23/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: There's plenty of things to do, and if you want, I could send a list and you guys can talk about what you want
9/23/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: How's your day been? How were classes?
9/23/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: Marion has asked me what I want to do and all I know if fredricksborg castle and tivoli
9/23/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: And Marion said she is definitely planning on tivoli this weekend
9/23/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: And clubs
9/23/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what marion is planning
9/23/19, 5:31 PM - Marianna: And you‚Äôve already kind of sent me a list and I have one from when I was researching for my proposal for my parents
9/23/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: Ah right right
9/23/19, 5:31 PM - Marianna: Would you rather Sarah and I just plan stuff?
9/23/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: No no no
9/23/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: I'm just wondering what you'd prefer
9/23/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: There's a lot of different things
9/23/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Like, historical districts, beautiful churches, and cool museums
9/23/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: And then Tivoli, shopping, bars
9/23/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: And I'm wondering which stuff you prefer to do
9/23/19, 5:37 PM - Marianna: I think tivoli, fredricksborg castle, historic districts would be most interesting to us
9/23/19, 5:37 PM - Marianna: And clubs at night
9/23/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: Sounds good
9/23/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: Also, is Marion planning on coming along then?
9/23/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: I want to use the other chat to plan
9/23/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Marion sounded like she did
9/23/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: I think she‚Äôs missing her gals
9/23/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: And I think it would be fun to have all of you for the weekend
9/23/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: That would be my ideal visit but I know it‚Äôs not necessarily feasible
9/23/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: But anyway how are you!
9/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Good! I'm a bit stressed about visa stuff because of this morning
9/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: But now I'm just waiting until they get it back to me
9/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: And I'll just pay for the rush service
9/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: And edit the paper and make a presentation and a poster for it
9/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: So that's just kinda weighing on me
9/23/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: Oh and also I've just lost 80% of my work motivation over the weekend, but thats honestly relaxing
9/23/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: ... In a not so good way probably
9/23/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: But other than that, good! Ate dinner and am now doing homework and hearing about the cruise
9/23/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: How are you? How were classes?
9/23/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Hey hey you got this
9/23/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I wish I lost of motivation
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: I just have a ton of grief that I didn‚Äôt do anything over the weekend
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Getting dinner now
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: And Sarah has a rough day so we‚Äôre drinking dark and stormies
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Screw the work
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: GOOD
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: CALL
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: I'm drinking ginger soda right now s
9/23/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: So I'm _almost_ there with you on the D&S
9/23/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry she had a rough day though
9/23/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Classes just didn't go well?
9/23/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve decided the spiced rum is gonna be our really bad or really good day drink
9/23/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: And nah boy/life stuff
9/23/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: And the amount of work we have
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been pretty awful at communication in the last 24hours
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: :(
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: You're fine
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: It may continue for a bit so I can get work done
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Don't sweat it
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Yeah just warning you I will stay alive
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Do what you need to do
9/23/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: I'll be around no matter what
9/23/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: But enjoy the dark and stormies
9/23/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: I hope things work out for Sarah, that's never an easy thing to deal with, but it's definitely better if you have a best friend with you
9/23/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah she‚Äôs got people both here and through FaceTime at time
9/23/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre thriving
9/23/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Dark and stomies are so good though
9/23/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Home**
9/23/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Marianna
9/23/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Question
9/23/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Is it too early for bed
9/23/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: In your _professional_ opinion
9/23/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/23/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: But you don‚Äôt have to rub it in!
9/23/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: üò∂
9/23/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Oh no I'm not rubbing it in at all
9/23/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: I'm not near done either
9/23/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: I just have a splitting headache
9/23/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/23/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: Well now I feel bad
9/23/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
9/23/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: You got this
9/23/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: Do anything exciting today?
9/23/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: Or just paperwork?
9/23/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Well
9/23/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I now have socialist healthcare
9/23/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Which is preeeetty cool I'd say
9/23/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Or socialized
9/23/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: No socialist
9/23/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Way different
9/23/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: But anyway yeah if I have any chronic ailments, nows the time üòÖ
9/23/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: That's petty much it though
9/23/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: What about you?
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Socialist headache?  Do you mean Bernie Sanders?
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Kidding love that old man
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: But also a socialized headache?
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Not really
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Bought perfume
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I decided again the playboy perfume
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Ooooo
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: I love perfume
9/23/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Originally we were like it‚Äôd be funny but then I decided I didn‚Äôt want to support that empire
9/23/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: They have an editing office in the building next to us at AIT
9/23/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: It's fun to go shopping for perfume or cologne and smell a lot of things
9/23/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Good date idea
9/23/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: And good for you
9/23/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: You're really showing Hugh Hefner's ghost who's boss
9/23/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: So which perfume did you end up getting?
9/23/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like roses and fruit
9/23/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: I like it
9/23/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: And also I def told Margaux when I booked the tickets but I guess she just didn‚Äôt realize
9/23/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Ooooo
9/23/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Sounds lovely
9/23/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: I hope I get to smell it!
9/23/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: And no worries, maybe time just snuck up on her
9/23/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: I may not bring it just because it‚Äôs breakable
9/23/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: I have like a travel one that I LOVE but i was going through it so fast here i was like it‚Äôs time to get a proper one
9/23/19, 8:53 PM - Marianna: But if not this weekend, next
9/23/19, 8:53 PM - Marianna: :)
9/23/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Sounds
9/23/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Good
9/23/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: To
9/23/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Me
9/23/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: :)
9/23/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Man, I wonder how many times we've talked about smells
9/23/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: It's gotta be more frequent than the average person
9/23/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: Maybe it's just an important thing to both of us
9/23/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/03kZz3zdSEUSNgjb3aqK7S?si=Z2vF_z2LSV2gr9JsZr1c2g
9/23/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a super important thing to me personally
9/23/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Sarah was like I know how you get pick soemthing and I‚Äôll wear it too
9/23/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: Oh, with the perfume?
9/23/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/23/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Also my crypto homework has gotten hard
9/23/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: And I have two assignments due by Sunday this is crazy

9/23/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Oh God
9/23/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Tonight just got insane
9/23/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Reid just broke up with his girlfriend
9/23/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: AND Hannah's boyfriend of two years just blindsided her with a breakup
9/23/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Oh god break out the rum
9/23/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: That genuinely sounds like a crying fest for everyone I am so sorry
9/23/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a rough Monday
9/23/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: You might need to go buy chocolate or ice cream or something
9/23/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: In other news I just wrote a freaking cool program to crack a pretty good encryption method
9/23/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm v happy with myself I did not expect to get there tonight
9/23/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: No booze
9/23/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Just tea and talk
9/23/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Probably good decisions up there
9/23/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Whatever you do don‚Äôt let marion give them post breakup advice‚Äîit might lighten the mood but it is not what they want to hear
9/23/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: (That was mostly a joke she‚Äôs just crazy but I love her when she tries to help even if she has no idea how to help)
9/23/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Yeaaaahhhhhhh I'll refrain from it
9/23/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Oh man
9/23/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I just realized
9/23/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Hannah and Reid are going to Switzerland together next weekend
9/23/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Like the two of them
9/23/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: And they were originally both cool with it because they were both in stable relationships
9/23/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: This is gonna be a wild wild couple of weeks
9/23/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Oh and solid stuff on the encryption! I really want to see your work for both that class and the bio one
9/23/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Bolth
9/23/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: But they sound super super cool
9/23/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Oh woah
9/23/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Well hopefully they‚Äôll still be able to have a good time
9/23/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Also if You‚Äôd think Hannah wants I have some killer playlists for this
9/23/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: I can send you the .py for the encryption but I think it might be cooler if I showed you sometime
9/23/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: If that‚Äôs cool with you?
9/23/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: And now I‚Äôve cleaned my room and I should probably look at some other homework tonight as well
9/24/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Ok
9/24/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Homebound
9/24/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: They seemed to be doing okay
9/24/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: I neglected 24 chapters of reading but it's okay
9/24/19, 12:07 AM - Caleb: I ended up showing them something called lasagna cat, which for the most part is really strange but harmless
9/24/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: But there's this ONE, and it's extra bizzare, four hours long, and at the end has something more horrifying, graffic, and thought provoking than any horror movie I've ever seen
9/24/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: And we just sat there and watched it
9/24/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: And I was like "oh shit that's right this exists", and they both looked very fixated and horrified
9/24/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: So maybe not the best thing
9/24/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: But I think that it's okay. It's either what they'll be thinking about tonight, which is okay, or it's not, and that's okay too
9/24/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Anyway, how was your night?
9/24/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: I need to sleep soon but I can stay up for a bit to chat :)
9/24/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Have you told me about lasagna cat before
9/24/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôve definitely heard of it but if it‚Äôs horror it‚Äôs not like I would have found it by myself
9/24/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: My nights been okay
9/24/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Only really got crypto homework 1 of 2 assignments done but that‚Äôs okay
9/24/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Sarah and I finished our proposal for our fall break trip and I‚Äôm pumped and now just have to wait for my parents to okay it
9/24/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm going over some notes I needed to fill in gaps for
9/24/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: And I still have to shower and make a marinade for chicken to cook tomorrow
9/24/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Adulting is hard with homework man
9/24/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: But overall a better night than I thought it would be
9/24/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: How has yours been?  Besides hanging with Reid and Hannah?
9/24/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: Oooo
9/24/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: Remind me what you want to do for your fall break?
9/24/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: And I might have told you about lasagna cat
9/24/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: It's not super significant to me or anything, but it's kinda interesting so maybe
9/24/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/rLGmjdm3vrw
9/24/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Its that thing
9/24/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: People remaking Garfield comic strips in live action just to prove how weird it is
9/24/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: And then some bit at the end
9/24/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: And other than that, my nights been okay
9/24/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: Just sort of melancholy by association I guess
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, luzern
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: All in 9 days
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna be a whirlwind
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Caleb: Woah
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Caleb: Yeah that's biting off a good chunk
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: And oh woah that is weird
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm sorry
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: But hey
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: Turn that frown
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Caleb: :(
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: Upside down
9/24/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: :)
9/24/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: ):
9/24/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt you dot it
9/24/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: Oh you did it
9/24/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: Boooooo
9/24/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: Jkjk
9/24/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: I'm :)
9/24/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: Honestly though, I'm doing pretty well
9/24/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: Things are stressful and hectic right now, but I definitely have a couple things to look forward to
9/24/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: I just have to keep my eyes on the horizon
9/24/19, 12:25 AM - Caleb: Because hey
9/24/19, 12:26 AM - Caleb: See you in 4 days :)
9/24/19, 12:26 AM - Caleb: But anyway, I have an 8:30 so I need to go to bed
9/24/19, 12:26 AM - Caleb: I needed to go to bed at like 7pm actually, but better late than never
9/24/19, 12:26 AM - Caleb: Good night! I'll talk to you tomorrow
9/24/19, 12:29 AM - Marianna: Oh woah see ya in 4 days
9/24/19, 12:29 AM - Marianna: Yes get some sleep
9/24/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôve done your good friend duties tonight so you deserve a good sleep
9/24/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: Hopefully I‚Äôll be following your lead in less than an hour
9/24/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: But goodnight!!
9/24/19, 1:15 AM - Marianna: Update Sarah is clubbing and I am cooking for an hour to prepare her chicken masala. Do I bring this up?
9/24/19, 1:54 AM - Marianna: (The answer is yes I‚Äôm gonna in the morning I‚Äôm fine just tired so now it‚Äôs time for a turo rudi and sleep
9/24/19, 7:45 AM - Caleb: Goooooooooooood morning
9/24/19, 7:45 AM - Caleb: I'm v tired
9/24/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: Good news is that I don't have anything tomorrow
9/24/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: So I'm split on just staying in and doing homework, and also maybe seeing if Marion wants to go out
9/24/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: I don't think I have the energy to keep up with Marion right now
9/24/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: Tbh she's a little intimidating when it comes to partying
9/24/19, 7:48 AM - Caleb: And I'm sorry Sarah went out clubbing instead of helping you prep, maybe she can help actually cook later on?
9/24/19, 8:16 AM - Marianna: Oh me too
9/24/19, 8:16 AM - Marianna: And usually I could sleep in a little more but our cleaning is this morning at 9am so even though we don‚Äôt have class until 11am, we have to be out of here
9/24/19, 8:16 AM - Marianna: :(
9/24/19, 8:16 AM - Marianna: But good morning
9/24/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: Going out with marion can be very fun but you have to be very willing for anything to happen
9/24/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: I usually can‚Äôt really keep up with her out
9/24/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay she was with Mark but she was gone for so many hours and I think I‚Äôm gonna ask her today if she can help in the future, or at least be here when I cook or it just feels very onesided like I technically have more classes and homework than she does o should‚Äôve have to spend 4 hours cooking for her if she‚Äôs not willing to help
9/24/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: Hopefully she‚Äôll receive it well
9/24/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: For now, no more talk about it she‚Äôs great
9/24/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: How has your early start day been so far?
9/24/19, 8:33 AM - Caleb: I was about to poke fun of you for complaining about having your apartment cleaned for you, but I feel like it's too early for a joke like that to land well üôÉ
9/24/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: Class is starting so I'll talk to you more later!
9/24/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: Okay no that‚Äôs totally fair
9/24/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: I am so glad I don‚Äôt have to clean this place
9/24/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: Like I could do it but it‚Äôs so nice and convenient not to have to
9/24/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: And okay say smart things in class!  What classes do you have today?
9/24/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: Classes so far have been fun
9/24/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: I have 3 today!
9/24/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: The first was Machine Learning
9/24/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: We talked about regularization and how to fix it
9/24/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: And I got a question right and felt cool
9/24/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: And then in my history of Copenhagen class, he showed a picture of a building and was like "can anyone give me a guess what year this is from? Caleb?" and I said 1731, and he goes "ooooo, close, but 1732. Nice try..."
9/24/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: And I still felt cool in a nerdy way
9/24/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: How are you? What's your day look like?
9/24/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs pretty impressive
9/24/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Maybe you should transfer and become an architecture student
9/24/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Kidding
9/24/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have been able to guess it
9/24/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm halfway through my only class
9/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: But there‚Äôs an option Kotlin Training this afternoon I want to stay for
9/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: And between them it‚Äôs just gonna be homework homework homework
9/24/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: And then eventually I‚Äôll cook tonight
9/24/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Hmmmm you know maybe I'm not cut out for this fancy computer stuff, you're right
9/24/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: I'll leave it to the pros like you.
9/24/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: The ones who know Kotlin
9/24/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: But honestly the only reason I could even relatively date the building is that basically half the city burned down in 1728, so they rebuilt, and ones in the style he was showing were from that rebuilding
9/24/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: So it's not as impressive as it sounds, it's not like I could look at it and go "hmmm yes this brick is from so-and-so thus is 1932"
9/24/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Also
9/24/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: Random question
9/24/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: How expensive is clothing in Budapest?
9/24/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt really know Kotlin which is why I‚Äôm going to this training
9/24/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: And well that‚Äôs still pretty smart to take those details and figure it out
9/24/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: And uh I don‚Äôt really know all I‚Äôve bought are vans and socks
9/24/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: So I do not know
9/24/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/24/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: I see
9/24/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Well I need a blazer and maybe some sweaters and stuff, and if it's cheapish there, I might need to do some shopping
9/24/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd do some googling
9/24/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: We have two pretty big malls
9/24/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: I would assume it would be cheaper than Copenhagen by the sound of it
9/24/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: But idk
9/24/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Malls are westend and arena if you want to see what stores are there
9/24/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt really plan any time for that but you could Thursday and/or Friday morning if that works or we can make time some other time
9/24/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Sounds good
9/24/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: I also can just go on my own if you're too busy, but also I feel like it would be way more fun with you
9/24/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/24/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs wing it
9/24/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Because who knows what my week and activities will look like
9/24/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: Also do you know when you‚Äôre flying out of here yet?  You don‚Äôt have to so don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt
9/24/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: No, I don't, sorry :(
9/24/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: I was probably going to shoot for Saturday morning if it all pans out
9/24/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: It's like a 20 hour flight, so if I get there Sunday morning I think it would be ideal
9/24/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: But also
9/24/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: Visa stuff
9/24/19, 1:57 PM - Caleb: So I should be able to let you know by end of week? Or maybe early next week
9/24/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: I'm freeeeeeeee
9/24/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Yaaaaay
9/24/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: By the way, do you think you would have time tonight to call?
9/24/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay just curious
9/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what I had assumed
9/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: And ah idk I‚Äôm gonna say probably not because I have so much work to do :(
9/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: I can see if I can‚Äôt
9/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Can**
9/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see how the rest of homework goes
9/24/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: Ah okay
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: No worries
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: I decided not to do the Kotlin training because it‚Äôs hustle xtra and he can‚Äôt make us need to know anything he goes over in it because not everyone is going
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: Just extra**
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: But I wish I could
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: Both the call and the training
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so stressed
9/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve made so little progress
9/24/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: :(
9/24/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: Kotlin is easy to pick up anway
9/24/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: You'll be fine
9/24/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: Its mostly just different in how you build it, but you're smart so I think you can figure it out super easily
9/24/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: And no worries about the call, I just would have preferred talk about Saturday, but I can just send it
9/24/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: Or I can just wait until you actually do have time to call if you want-- there's good news and bad news
9/24/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: Oh no
9/24/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: I can probably call sometime in the next three days
9/24/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: I might also be able to tonight when I cook if you‚Äôd like
9/24/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: I mean we don't need to
9/24/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: You can already guess what I'm going to say
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Darn
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: That was crappy timing
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah, its a shame that the trip goes into sunday too :/
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Um what
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: KIDDING KIDDING
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: But now the news seems less bad
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: You had me seriously ticked at that prof
9/24/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: and also I talked to Morten, who's my professor
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: So are you occupied all day Saturday?
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Not all day
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Just morning into early afternoon
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Which is still shitty
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: But we have the rest of the day and I'll 100% spend it with you and your friends
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: HOWEVER
9/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: I also talked to Morten
9/24/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: And worked it out so that if you want to come, you're absolutely more than welcome to-- and you'd also be included in the budget so you (probably) wouldn't need to pay a dime
9/24/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: We're going to old Viking Ruins, museums, a peaceful village in the Fjord, and some other fun stuff
9/24/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: And I'd be delighted to have you along if that's what you want
9/24/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: But also, you're with Sarah and Margaux and Marion, and I don
9/24/19, 3:54 PM - Caleb: don't want to take you away from them, so I absolutely understand if you want to just stay in Cope and spend the time with them. Don't forget that I'll also be around next week, so even though I'm angry and sad, its not the end of the world because I'll still get to spend quality time with you in Budapest
9/24/19, 3:56 PM - Caleb: But also that's selfish of me, and I want you to have the Danish experience that would be best for you, and again I totally understand and won't be hurt if you want to spend it with in Copenhagen with your friends (until I get back at like 5:30, and then we have all that night and Sunday)
9/24/19, 3:57 PM - Caleb: But the choice is yours, just let me know and then I can still help plan out things for you guys and Marion/Margaux to do if you want
9/24/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: ...well
9/24/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: I would like to spend time with you this weekend
9/24/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: But you will be here for a while the next week and I won‚Äôt have a chance to see Copenhagen again so I think I‚Äôd rather stay with Marion and Sarah and do what we had originally planned
9/24/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
9/24/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: I really wish I could hang with you
9/24/19, 4:56 PM - Marianna: But part of it is I don‚Äôt want to ditch them for the day and while the fjord sounds lovely, I think I‚Äôd rather stay in Copenhagen proper
9/24/19, 4:56 PM - Marianna: If that okay
9/24/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Hey like I said, that's more than okay
9/24/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: I'm pretty sad
9/24/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: But also, I completely understand
9/24/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: I'll just show you lots of pictures from it to make you jealous üòâ
9/24/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: Should I leave most of the plan that day to you and your friends so you can do exactly what you want? Or do you want me to send what I had planned just so you guys don't have to figure out what you're doing
9/24/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôd appreciate anything
9/24/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: And there was the stuff I texted in the group
9/24/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: And okaaaaay you can try
9/24/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs remarkably weird timing
9/24/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: What if people were traveling this weekend?  Or had parents visiting?  Are you supposed to just leave them and not see them when they flew across the ocean?
9/24/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/24/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: I think it's absolutely awful to have a mandatory Saturday event
9/24/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: I mean how is that even allowed?
9/24/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: I sorry
9/24/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Maybe I should stop by the registrar and ask about it
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Eh you don‚Äôt have to make that big a stink about it
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: But if you‚Äôre doing it for you feel free too
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: But it sucks but like Budapest!
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so pumped to show you around
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah, I'm honestly pretty angry about it
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Just angry and sad
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: And I have a 2-6pm field trip the second Friday so kind of the same thing?
9/24/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: No sad
9/24/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: I was excited to show you around
9/24/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: But hey
9/24/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: You'll have a good tour guide anyway
9/24/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: In the end, I just want you to have a good time and feel like your trip was worth it
9/24/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: BUT YES, no sad
9/24/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Budapest
9/24/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Budapest good
9/24/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Happy

9/24/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: PAMPERED
9/24/19, 5:34 PM - Caleb: Truly good boys
9/24/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: I'm wondering which dog pictures I haven't shown you yet
9/24/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: I might need to ration them out
9/24/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: But I like them so much
9/24/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: :(

9/24/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: My
9/24/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: Gosh
9/24/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: My goal in life is to be that cozy sometime
9/24/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Hey maybe I can convince my parents to take the dogs down to Davidson sometime
9/24/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: That would be fun
9/24/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: All my friends could meet them!
9/24/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: Oh my god you would be the COOLEST
9/24/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: everyone would want to be your friend
9/24/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: Well I guess you‚Äôre probably already used to that mr cool kid but you might be able to increase your coolness still
9/24/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Shhhhhhhhhh
9/24/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Don't make me blush
9/24/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Not true
9/24/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Also
9/24/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Guess what
9/24/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/24/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: What
9/24/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: And no it‚Äôs kind of my thing to make you blush
9/24/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Or at least try

9/24/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: There's your comprehensive Copenhagen to-do list
9/24/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: It's just a _little_ more than we can do in a weekend, but it should be helpful to pick from √° la carte
9/24/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Crazy
9/24/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre crazy
9/24/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: But thank you
9/24/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: What are the best bakeries?
9/24/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Sarah will definitely want to go to the best where you can get good chocolatey things
9/24/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/24/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: DELICIOUS
9/24/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: OH LORD
9/24/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Also
9/24/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Someone ordered sushi and it got delivered to our apartment
9/24/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: And now I'm hell bent on getting it to whoever it belongs to
9/24/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: Is it for someone in your apartment?  Surely that can‚Äôt be too hard?
9/24/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Nope
9/24/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: We were the wrong apartment
9/24/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: It's somewhere in our building
9/24/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/24/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Well that is harder
9/24/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Eeeeeeeat it

9/24/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Also, this is super out of the blue
9/24/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: But what do you think my spirit animal is
9/24/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: Small bear
9/24/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Or dog
9/24/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: But like you‚Äôd be a tame and cuddly version of the small bear or like a wolf
9/24/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Idk

9/24/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: It lists bakeries too
9/24/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: Oh and WAIT DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT MY NICKNAME AS A KID
9/24/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: It relates to the bear thing
9/24/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt personally agree with either of those but idk
9/24/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: And yeah I did but is there one of the bakeries that really stands out of those?  Because obviously we can‚Äôt do anything
9/24/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Everything**

9/24/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: Emmerys is good and they're everywhere, but I guess they're not super special

9/24/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a colloquialism Caleb
9/24/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Sorry you have work
9/24/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: You need to do that
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm done the work for tonight and just in bed but I probably should sleep so I can feel okay and be productive today and tomorrow
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Oh okay
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Talk for two minutes?
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: That or I spent all of Friday night doing comp bio coding instead of hanging with you all
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Ah okay fine but only because I want to
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: But 2!  Minutes!
9/24/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: :(
9/24/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Oh god my phone light is so bright
9/24/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: MY EYEBALLS
9/24/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!  Talking to you is never a chore I just need to sleep sleep rn
9/24/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/24/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/24/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Thanks for indulging me and talking :)
9/24/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: I hope classes go well, and I'll talk to you tomorrow!
9/25/19, 7:06 AM - Marianna: Gooooooooodmorning
9/25/19, 7:06 AM - Marianna: How to the Danes like draw out their good morning like that
9/25/19, 7:06 AM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs god morgen right
9/25/19, 7:07 AM - Marianna: But if you say goooooooood morgen it‚Äôs the oo sound and not the ah sound
9/25/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: You know
9/25/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: Now that you mention it, I don't know if I've heard a Dane make a prolonged "o" sound
9/25/19, 9:41 AM - Caleb: I guess it's more of an √∏√∏√∏√∏ sound
9/25/19, 9:41 AM - Caleb: It's hard to explain
9/25/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: And I don't know if I'm willing to sit and make OOOOOOO sounds into my phone while people watch
9/25/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know what the √∏ sound sounds like
9/25/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: We don‚Äôt have it in Hungarian
9/25/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: We do have this fun guy though: ≈ë
9/25/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: But yeah you‚Äôve abused your voice memo privileges
9/25/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Not that I didn‚Äôt absolutely LOVE it
9/25/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: But there‚Äôs a difference between drunk doing it in your room and like in public sober
9/25/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: Ooof
9/25/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: I mean I wouldn't say I "abused" it
9/25/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Drunk me was just like "oh this is WAY easier than typing"
9/25/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs a fair point
9/25/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Also
9/25/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Re: the itinerary
9/25/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: I see some issues with it
9/25/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: Uh oh
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: The a la Carte thing was more for ideas for you and friends planning on Saturday
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt take anything from that
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Ah okay
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Well
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: I was going on what rick Steve‚Äôs has and other stuff
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: First off Tivoli is closed now
9/25/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: What?
9/25/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Reopens for Halloween I think?
9/25/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: It's a seasonal thing
9/25/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Oh I thought that was an option because you mentioned it
9/25/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Darn
9/25/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: And also, Cisterns has daytime hours
9/25/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: So either Saturday or Sunday during the day would be best
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: (preferably Sunday)
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: I was gonna do it Saturday afternoon
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: (because I really really want to go with you)
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Ah
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: They close at 6m
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Oh okay
9/25/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: I thought you meant after that
9/25/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: Okay
9/25/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: I took a second look at it, and it's actually totally fine (except Tivoli I think)
9/25/19, 11:14 AM - Caleb: Sorry
9/25/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: I feel like this weekend isn't ideal for you, and you've done so much for me coming to Budapest but I feel like I just haven't been able to get my shit together with this
9/25/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: I wish I was better at helping lay things out and getting a solid plan for you so you didn't have to do anything and just come have fun, so yeah, I'm sorry I kinda wasn't
9/25/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Ooooh okay so I would want to wait and do the cisterns with you because I think it is gonna be cool but I think it works best to do just Fredricksborg on Sunday because it takes so long to get there and timing wise, it wouldn‚Äôt work to do that in conjunction with something else because realistically we‚Äôre all probs gonna be hungover and tired Saturday morning so we can‚Äôt really get a super early start
9/25/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm really sorry
9/25/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: If you can figure out a schedule that does make it work, I‚Äôd be willing to do that but Sarah and I looked at it and I feel like it just won‚Äôt
9/25/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Hey hey don't worry about it
9/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: I've been to Frederiksborg before, and I think I left at like 10, ate lunch, walked around the town, saw another museum,  and then took the train back and was home at like 7
9/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: So I think it's totally feasible to do, but again I completely understand that it's the schedule that works best for you, and honestly it would be fun to go again
9/25/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: And don‚Äôt worry about the planning stuff!  I‚Äôm actually pretty good at this
9/25/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Haaa, yeah I can tell üòÖ
9/25/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: I'll give it to you, you're probably infinitely better than me at it
9/25/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Well we want to do rosenborg castle, cisterns, and fredricksborg
9/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: So we can‚Äôt spend all day Saturday doing that
9/25/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: I just feel bad because you've done so much for me and I'm going to have a great time in Budapest, and I feel like I couldn't return that
9/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: But if you‚Äôve already done fredricksborg then maybe you don‚Äôt want to do it again
9/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: Ha we‚Äôll see if my plan in Budapest works out
9/25/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Well, I just hope leave me some room to breath üòÖ
9/25/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: I can use a scheduled nap every now and then
9/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: No I didn‚Äôt schedule naps
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha I was joking
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: It's all good
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: And re: fredricksborg, I'd love to do it again
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs only Saturday/Sunday that we have lots to see
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: I can do all of this anyway, but for me I just want to spend time with you while you're here
9/25/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: But would you RATHER do cisterns
9/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: It doesn't matter what we're actually doing
9/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Cisterns are open other weekends
9/25/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: What works best for you works best for you, and that's what I want
9/25/19, 1:16 PM - Caleb: Anyway
9/25/19, 1:16 PM - Caleb: How are your classes so far?
9/25/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Yeah if you would rather do cisterns this weekend, it would be smart if we could figure out how to do fredricksborg and rosenborg Saturday. But then we don‚Äôt have as much time for the walking around and trampolines and reffed because we‚Äôd have to rush to fredricksborg after lunch
9/25/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: So idk
9/25/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: We could call tonight to talk about it maybe?
9/25/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: But I kind of think this is the best way because I really don‚Äôt think we can do both castles Saturday
9/25/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah, it would probably be best to call about it
9/25/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: We can just table this discussion, and I'll look into timing and whatnot
9/25/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: But is that your shortlist of things to do? I feel like that's totally achievable in a weekend
9/25/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah
9/25/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Just those three big things, walking, trampolines, and reffen and hanging with friends
9/25/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: But classes have been good!  Not great but fine
9/25/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Sounds good, I already know where the best places for walking/landmarks are so I can help with those
9/25/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: What classes have you had so far?
9/25/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Yay!
9/25/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Sarah wants to see colorful houses
9/25/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: And the water
9/25/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: Say no more Familia
9/25/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: I have a circuit we can do
9/25/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: It includes that, the royal residence, a beautiful church, and iconic scenes
9/25/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: And theory of comp and Hungarian
9/25/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Oooooh
9/25/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Maybe after cisterns when you join us on Saturday
9/25/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: ^?
9/25/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: Have you had coffee with profs yet?
9/25/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: Actually no
9/25/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: I had an emergency with my Chinese visa
9/25/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: So I had to miss one of them, and am probably going to be late to my other one
9/25/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: And am now fighting the Chinese bureaucracy
9/25/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: Which is simultaneously hyper organized, but also super chaotic
9/25/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Oh no what‚Äôs going on with it
9/25/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry I know you were looking forward to chatting with your profs
9/25/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: Well the embassy is apparently closed on Monday and Tuesday, and my appointment was Friday
9/25/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: But I sort of need my passport for traveling to Budapest
9/25/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: And apparently the process is more elaborate for me since I'm American
9/25/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: So I needed to get on it ASAP and basically show up to beg them to expedite it all and let me come event though I don't have an appointment
9/25/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: But don't worry
9/25/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: It'll work out
9/25/19, 1:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/25/19, 2:13 PM - Marianna: Oh shoot yeah this is getting complicated
9/25/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to figure it all out
9/25/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: But today is Wednesday?  Can‚Äôt you go today?
9/25/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: And yeah travel to Russia and China and some other places can be very hard for Americans
9/25/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: But hey
9/25/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: At least you‚Äôll be getting some memes to cheer you up
9/25/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: We were told not to have anything sent from the us because customs could hold it forever basically so my parents can send me memes
9/25/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: At least not in paper form anyway
9/25/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: Also hey this is a random reminder you‚Äôre doing great and everything will work out you sound v stressed about a whole bunch of stuff and I am sorry but I believe in you even if you‚Äôre drowning in a mountain of paperwork
9/25/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Okay it also got complicated because I don't have my actual CPR card which is basically my social security card
9/25/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: I just have a piece of paper with it on it
9/25/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: So I'm like "no I swear this is the only thing they gave me"
9/25/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: Also
9/25/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: My Chinese actually did come in handy
9/25/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: Because I was able to explain that it was an original document given to me by government workers
9/25/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: So hey looks like 5 years payed off
9/25/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Also thank you, that's just what I needed to hear :)
9/25/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/25/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: Visa stuff is submitted
9/25/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: I'm picking it up on Friday if it's approved
9/25/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: And I ended up having coffee with Emily Juel and our professor for like an hour, even though I was 45 minutes late to that one
9/25/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: And it was SUPER fun, it was a really interesting conversation
9/25/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: And then I went with Emily and saw a statue of her direct relative that's like RIGHT next to a major plaza and looks super important
9/25/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Hi!  I‚Äôve been working and in class
9/25/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: And yeah I would bet that being able to speak Chinese might get you a few brownie points at least to be like please please please help me
9/25/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: And yay congrats!  Crack open the wine!
9/25/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: WOAH hey I just got my paper back by the way
9/25/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: 96%
9/25/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: Woot
9/25/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: And what‚Äôd you guys talk about?  What class was this professor?
9/25/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: And WOOOT
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: doubly crack open the wine
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Also I really hate how people don‚Äôt respect honor code here
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not a big deal
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: Heeellllll yea
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: Aw
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: :(
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
9/25/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: It's sort of the same here
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: But talking with other students and they‚Äôre like oh we always cheat
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Woah
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's even worse than here
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: That's insane
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm like well maybe that explains how you got flown out to google for an interview
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: And everyone wants to talk about homework we‚Äôre not allowed too
9/25/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: So like I‚Äôll give broad educational summaries of the material we need to complete homework but I‚Äôm not about to show you my code
9/25/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: And like Hans is not respecting it all at currently
9/25/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: wOAH there Hans
9/25/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: Uncool
9/25/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: And I wish I could help him because he‚Äôs never taken a proof class but he needs to talk to the prof
9/25/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: Do they just have no guilt or remorse over it?
9/25/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: Apparently not
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: I cheated once
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt get it
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Genuinely
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Like back in 6th grade
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah but everyone did
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: But I still don't feel great about it
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: I just don‚Äôt like being surrounded by people talking about the homework
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Awww
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: I'm really sorry
9/25/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: That's not a good environment to be in at all
9/25/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also why I kind of like working at the apt better
9/25/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Also a REALLY annoying girl who likes to work with us for comp theory
9/25/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Sarah literally met her and thought ‚Äúwow she‚Äôs gonna annoy marianna so much‚Äù
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: We don‚Äôt entirely know what it is
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Aaaaaaaaand she was right?
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Oh woah, really?
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Oh for sure
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm in 2 classes with her
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: I feel like I can usually pinpoint when someone rubs me the wrong way
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: It's fairly rare so it's pretty easy to pin down I think
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Oh lord
9/25/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: God help your soul
9/25/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: Me too kind of
9/25/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt dislike many people
9/25/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: But when I do I don‚Äôt want to be anywhere near them
9/25/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: And in most cases it‚Äôs justified
9/25/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: I also think I am a pretty good judge of character even when I just meet people for the first time
9/25/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: I joke everyone should bring me on first dates with them
9/25/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: And she keeps stealing peoples seats in Hungarian and we‚Äôre all like can you please choose a seat already you‚Äôre just displacing peoooe and it‚Äôs annoying
9/25/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Done class!
9/25/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Time to order tickets for fall breaks!
9/25/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: Ha, but it's what I did and it worked out for me so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/25/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: Oh man
9/25/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: And the seat changing thing
9/25/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: How do people live like that
9/25/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: Once I pick a seat on the first day, I've got like 2 classes to try to shuffle around if I really want to
9/25/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: But then it's set in stone
9/25/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: I'm a creature of habit
9/25/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/25/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: I see what you did there
9/25/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm the same way
9/25/19, 6:12 PM - Marianna: I _can_ sit wherever but it‚Äôs comforting if I don‚Äôt
9/25/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: I mean
9/25/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Unless someone tries to talk my ear off in class, I'm usually pretty content anywhere
9/25/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Or if it's a lot of group work with the people around me, and they aren't good to work with
9/25/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: But other than that, it really doesn't matter where I sit
9/25/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: Oh and also if light is in my eyes or something, but that's different
9/25/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I get those
9/25/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Mostly the project thing I think
9/25/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/25/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Bad group members kill me
9/25/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: I feel like I'm usually pretty lucky though
9/25/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Oh! I meant to ask, did you end up talking to Sarah about the Chicken Marsala?
9/25/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Sorry that's super random, we're cooking right now and I was thinking about it earlier today
9/25/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  She helped and said she‚Äôd help in the future or at least be here
9/25/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: It also was pretty gosh darn good
9/25/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Are we cooking or eating out this weekend?  I kind of assumed eating out because it‚Äôs just Saturday
9/25/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: (Plus any drunk food we crave lol)
9/25/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: I think Sarah and I are gonna eat an early dinner at AIT on Friday
9/25/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: Well
9/25/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: Saturday was going to be eating out
9/25/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: I was thinking Sunday I can make breakfast
9/25/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: And then lunch at this place in Helsingor
9/25/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/25/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: This place*
9/25/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: And then we probably wouldn't have time to cook dinner because you need to get to the airport
9/25/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: But that depends on when we get back
9/25/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Also I had places I was going to take us to eat on Saturday, but I can just pass them on for you if you want

9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: So now you're expected
9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: Oh well thank her for not hitting me with the bad
9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: Bat**
9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: That would have been bad
9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt have loved that
9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: Personally
9/25/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: I know I‚Äôm biased but
9/25/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: I told her you're not intimidating

9/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: People have actually told me that
9/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: But to other I apparently am very approachable
9/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs what I am going for depending on the person
9/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll try to reign it in for her
9/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Also
9/25/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Wolfram alpha coming in clutch
9/25/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>

9/25/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: We are doing wine night tonight
9/25/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: But no shots
9/25/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: We were curious how many shots the airplane bottles were
9/25/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Also
9/25/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: What do you call the airplane bottles
9/25/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Oh right! Wine night!
9/25/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Let me know how it goes
9/25/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: And not sure, I think I call them airplane bottles?
9/25/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Update we‚Äôre doing homework
9/25/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: And I have never heard them called airplane bottle but that‚Äôs what sarah said but I have only heard them called nips
9/25/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: .... Nips
9/25/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Uhhhh
9/25/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's a you thing
9/25/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: I've literally never heard that in my life, sorry
9/25/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: I googled it
9/25/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a northeastern thing
9/25/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Apparently
9/25/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/25/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: Us northeastern kids
9/25/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: Buncha weirdos
9/25/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: Wait wait isn't Sarah from Virginia?
9/25/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/25/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: That is not the northeast
9/25/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: No
9/25/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: No it's not
9/25/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: I still don't think it's the south though
9/25/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Not parts of it
9/25/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Or maybe I'm thinking of Maryland actually
9/25/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Anyway
9/25/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: How's wine night?
9/25/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Eh both are arguable
9/25/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Good
9/25/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm doing homework
9/25/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve asked this and I always forget
9/25/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Have you seen princess bride
9/25/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: If I say no will you watch it with me sometime?
9/25/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd say yes if you have
9/25/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I love it so much
9/25/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: But I just walked around my apartment shouting liar and I was very proud of it because it‚Äôs a reference to the movie
9/25/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/25/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Tricked ya
9/25/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Now you have to watch it with me
9/25/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: You've fallen for one of the two classic blunders! The first being never get involved in a land war in Asia but only slightly lesser known: never go in against a Grenko when MOVIES are on the line!
9/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt mind watch like any movies with you
9/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: So twist my arm to watch my favorite
9/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Also I see your reference and I respect it so much
9/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: And I literally read it in the guys voice
9/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Wonderful
9/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: It's a date then
9/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: I'll pencil you in for January
9/25/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: We can have rum and warm food and fuzzy blankets and save it for when there's snow on the ground
9/25/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Or we can when you‚Äôre here if we have time
9/25/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Or we can do that
9/25/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: That sounds like a dream
9/25/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Or
9/25/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Or
9/25/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Just hear me out
9/25/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: We could do bolth!
9/25/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Why do you think I was hoping you scheduled a nap in for Budapest üòâ
9/25/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Well not that
9/25/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: But also I wouldn‚Äôt get a nap in if we watch princess bride
9/25/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: Although I may have fallen asleep to it a lot
9/25/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: It was a common choice of mine for late night road trips
9/25/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Ooo ya caught me
9/25/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: I was hoping for a thicc nap so I can catch up on sleep
9/25/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Guilty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/25/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: And I think my road trip choice was always a Loony Toons DVD we had
9/25/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: There are some AMAZING cartoons in that thing, I could probably still quote them
9/25/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: OH or we would bring the GameCube and manage to set it up, and we'd play games with each other in the back and drive my parents insane
9/25/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: No no sleep
9/25/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: You won‚Äôt get any while here
9/25/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/25/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Well that's unfortunate
9/25/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: I like sleep
9/25/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: And oof that would drive my parents crazy
9/25/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: They wouldn‚Äôt allow it in pretty sure
9/25/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/25/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: I have 0 idea how they survived it
9/25/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: I don't know how WE survived it actually
9/25/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: I'm pretty sure my brothers made me cry more than once over that stuff
9/25/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm the worst in a car
9/25/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd be like Joey get out of the middle of the car I get to use it as a headrest now

9/25/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Mean
9/25/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: No mercy for the youngest
9/25/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Poor lil joey
9/25/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Joey also does a lot of ticks which isn‚Äôt his fault he just fidgets but I‚Äôd be like can you please stop snapping the cord on your bag
9/25/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: No
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: I do not stand with youngest I‚Äôm sorry
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Blocked
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: We stand at opposite ends of the an impass
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Jk
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: It'll just be a rocky relationship from here on out
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Obviously
9/25/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/25/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: Also, I know I've definitely asked you this before, but what's your take on foreign music for studying?
9/25/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: And hey
9/25/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd like to think complement
9/25/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: ?
9/25/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: So I can‚Äôt do music with words I know when I‚Äôm studying
9/25/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: So yes for that
9/25/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: But no for when I‚Äôm just generalling listening to music because I usually just want to sing along
9/25/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/3ePsmfhb7hduvnDadoNNyi?si=X6u0e1u_Raix76s2-KPpXg
9/25/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Well there ya go then
9/25/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll give her a listen
9/25/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: And hey

9/25/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: What was that too
9/25/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Oh this
9/25/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: I just was trying to figure out what you meant but I think I did it
9/25/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Just missing a word or two
9/25/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: Sorry I‚Äôve been working with complments of sets
9/25/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Instead of the younger sibling vs older sibling dynamic being a start to rocky stuff
9/25/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: We just have different prospective
9/25/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I figured
9/25/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: I was joking anyway
9/25/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: See
9/25/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: No confusion necessary
9/25/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Just get on my level
9/25/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Okay how much wine have you had
9/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Sajnos, only 2
9/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm good
9/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Soemtimes I think that I‚Äôve been drinking regularly I‚Äôm building my tolerance
9/25/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: But then I remember no
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Christ I had like 10ish on Tuesday night
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Also sajnos means unfortunately in Hungarian
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just practicing
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: I counted the shots as double because it was the 60% and it was a big glass
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: And ah
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Sorry to subject you to that
9/25/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: I'm too scared to listen to the messages
9/25/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Maybe typing is a good call from here
9/25/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Also, I like that
9/25/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Sajnos
9/25/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: It's a good looking word
9/25/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Okay but it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs spelling like with American sounds
9/25/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Ooooof
9/25/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: They made me happy
9/25/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: It was fun to hear your voice
9/25/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Even if it was just you laughing
9/25/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Or saying words really slowly
9/25/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: Well
9/25/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: Yay
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: I'm glad
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: At least I embarrassed myself for a reason then :)
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: It
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Was
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: A
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Good
9/25/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Cause
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Man that's crazy that it was your first interaction with drunk Caleb though
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Guess you're about to meet him in person
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: So
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Pumped
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: U better be hype
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Beat me to it
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Ha
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Got
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Ya
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Boy
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Yep
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: You got me :)
9/25/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Anyway, I'm probably gonna head to bed
9/25/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: I'm tired and not feeling great, so it's an early night for me
9/25/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Have fun at your wine night, I'll talk to you tomorrow
9/25/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah I need these people to leave my apartment now
9/25/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
9/25/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: Oh and it's not like a sick not feeling well, it's just a stomach thing
9/25/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: So don't be worried
9/26/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Ha
9/26/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Good luck
9/26/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: I low key was like okay I‚Äôm showering you all can stay for however long you‚Äôd like
9/26/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Ah, yeah, veeeeeerry subtle
9/26/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: I'm sure they'll catch on from saying "stay however long you'd like", it's a pretty clear indicator to leave
9/26/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: Anyway, goodnight!
9/26/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Oh
9/26/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: And hey
9/26/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: See ya tomorrow
9/26/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: Also-logistics questions:
Can I borrow shampoo/body wash while there?  I can bring some I just would rather not but feel free to say no
Should I bring a towel?  Again, I can do either but obviously it would be easier to not have to bring one but I get if I need to
Getting around Copenhagen-is there like a day metro pass we should buy?  Or just do individual trips?
9/26/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: But goodnight for now and WOAH see you tomorrow I cannot wait!  Less than 48 hours!
9/26/19, 12:46 AM - Marianna: Also my dumb ass decided rn would be the perfect time to install all the updates I‚Äôve been putting off for like a year on my laptop
9/26/19, 2:12 AM - Caleb: 1) yeah you can definitely borrow shampoo and body wash, as long as you don't mind that the shampoo is for blond hair and the body wash is just a bar of soap
2) I only have one towel, and I'd be okay with you using it, but it's up to you if you want to just being your own
3) ha! This is something I actually _did_ take care of logistically! I have a thing called a Risjekort which is like an all-inclusive metro pass. I don't need to use it if I'm in a certain zone, and we'll be staying in that zone. You can borrow mine if you throw a couple bucks on it, but Sarah is going to need to borrow one from Marion or Margaux and do the same if she can
9/26/19, 2:12 AM - Caleb: Okay time for more schleep
9/26/19, 7:07 AM - Marianna: Ah so it sounds like I will probably bring my own shampoo and conditioner and probably towel too
9/26/19, 7:07 AM - Marianna: But thanks you
9/26/19, 7:07 AM - Marianna: And okay that sounds good!
9/26/19, 7:07 AM - Marianna: And good morning
9/26/19, 7:08 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been up since 6 and just haven‚Äôt been able to fall back asleep which is the most frustrating thing
9/26/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: Gooooooooood morning
9/26/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: I'm sorry to hear that, that's always the worst
9/26/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: Maybe you'll be able to get a good nap in later?
9/26/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: Maybe
9/26/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: One can hope
9/26/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: I believe
9/26/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: In your ability
9/26/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: To fit a nap in
9/26/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Also, what are your and Marion‚Äôs physical addresses?  We have to tell our program basically all of our itinerary details whenever we leave Budapest so they know where we are
9/26/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: I do too
9/26/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: But I also known I would nap and put off work which I should do
9/26/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Nimbusparken 32, 1,-1
2000 Frederiksberg
Denmark
9/26/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: For both of them?
9/26/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: Oh that's mine
9/26/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: Do you know Marion‚Äôs?
9/26/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: Nimbusparken 42, 2
2000 Frederiksberg
Denmark
9/26/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: I don't know what her room number is, but she's in 42 or 40
9/26/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: And they're the same building
9/26/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: I think it's actually 40, but if you need it more specific you should probably just ask
9/26/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: By the way it's also RIGHT next to my building, like a 30 second walk
9/26/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: Okay we‚Äôll say 40
9/26/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll get bad at us for that
9/26/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: Mad**
9/26/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: Yeah you had mentioned that
9/26/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: They basically just want to know where we are in case something happens in a city they can know if any of there students are there and how to get in touch with them and stuff
9/26/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: Yeah that should be good enough then
9/26/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: Unless they're mailing Marion AIT advertisements, they'll figure it out
9/26/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: Probably not
9/26/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: They are wildly efficient at not wasting paper here
9/26/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: The only class that gives us handouts is Hungarian and theory and we‚Äôve only gotten 2 half sheets from theory
9/26/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Everything else is through dear and darling moodle
9/26/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: Okay
9/26/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: Is it just me, or is moodle kinda garbage
9/26/19, 9:55 AM - Caleb: I feel like there's a billion better things to use, and we're stuck with something that looks like it was designed by a guy who learned how to write HTML in 1997
9/26/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: I like it
9/26/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: They did the new design
9/26/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs better than blackboard I think
9/26/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: I mean
9/26/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: Maybe
9/26/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: But even in high school, we had something called CORE and it was amazing
9/26/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: It had a calendar of due dates and everything
9/26/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: And I have something like that now, it's called Canvas
9/26/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: Oh okay I can see how that‚Äôs cool
9/26/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve heard of core but never used it
9/26/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: And done classes for the day!
9/26/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna go home and do some homework
9/26/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: WOOO
9/26/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: How were classes?
9/26/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Good
9/26/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: I really am enjoying the material in basically all of them
9/26/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Well that's awesome to hear
9/26/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: What did you have today?
9/26/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Like Hungarian goes on for ages like longest 2 hours of my life but i still like learning the language and I zone out in mobile development a bit but again, still cool what we‚Äôre doing in the class
9/26/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Theory this morning!
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Has mobile development gotten more interesting?
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: What do you have today?  This is your late day right?
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Slightly
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just fun to see how to make stuff
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Well that's cool
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Prof isn‚Äôt the most riveting thought
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: I'm glad you've gotten past covering the different OS's
9/26/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Our first hw is to make a minesweeper game due next Friday
9/26/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Ooooooooo
9/26/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah no we‚Äôre actually doing stuff now
9/26/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: That sounds actually challenging
9/26/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: And hey! Now you get to have all your friends go, "so hear me out, I had an idea"
9/26/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: And yeah
9/26/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Today is my late day
9/26/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm already doing that to Sarah
9/26/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: I currently have two
9/26/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: Two singular ideas
9/26/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: My brainpower at work
9/26/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: I may try to do a venture fund pitch in the spring
9/26/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: Well yay for late days!
9/26/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: (Except in the afternoon when it‚Äôs late and you still have class)
9/26/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Yeah I mean I have ideas too, but I guess I don't have time to do them is the issue
9/26/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Also I have like 0 clue where to get started with most of them, and I'd actually need to invest in hosting and stuff so I'm like ehhhhhhhhhh
9/26/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: But hey maybe I should just drop out and do it, follow my dreams or whatever
9/26/19, 11:30 AM - Marianna: Yeaaaaaah I feel all those things
9/26/19, 11:30 AM - Marianna: Which is why I am potentially thinking venture fund
9/26/19, 11:30 AM - Marianna: But that really doesn‚Äôt fix the issue of time
9/26/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: Hey I'll have a gap year between college and med school
9/26/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: Maybe I'll do that to actually be able to afford med school
9/26/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Sure beats selling my organs or something
9/26/19, 11:35 AM - Marianna: Oooooh that sounds like a plan
9/26/19, 11:35 AM - Marianna: What are you actually thinking about doing for your gap year
9/26/19, 11:35 AM - Marianna: (You don‚Äôt have to know you‚Äôve got a ton of time)
9/26/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: And please don‚Äôt say selling your organs I‚Äôm afraid that doesn‚Äôt always work out so well
9/26/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: I was probably going to just work and travel, pay off debt and whatnot
9/26/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: So this would probably be more exciting and productive
9/26/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: I just need to figure out databases and more of the backend stuff honestly
9/26/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: ... And the front end
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: ... So pretty much everything
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: ...and everything in the middle?
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: Haha
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Ah
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Ha
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Yes
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: That sounds like a good plan
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: Either honestly
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: I should probably just relearn how to code honestly
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: Not sure how much travel you could do with work
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: You could travel a lot more with doing your own idea
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Marianna: Destination coding
9/26/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Yeah, that's fair
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: I could be the guy that makes a qUiRkY nEw StArtUp
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: Oh
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: One that has a name with no vowels
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: Well yes you _could_
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: Also random but are a you a scarf person?
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: Oh yee
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: I love scarves
9/26/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: I only brought one though and I'm kinda sad
9/26/19, 11:40 AM - Marianna: ...I only brought 4 and I‚Äôm kind of struggling
9/26/19, 11:40 AM - Marianna: But they are probably my most used like they go with a large number of my outfits
9/26/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: Yeah you're a real sucker for scarves, aren't ya
9/26/19, 11:40 AM - Marianna: Oh and I brought a wooly one for winter
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: I feel like ever time I see a snap of you, you have some sort of scarf on
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not too cold in cope that I‚Äôm gonna want to wear it this weekend right?  Ditto to the gloves?
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Marianna: Yeah most usually
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Marianna: Especially with sweater
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Marianna: Like I don‚Äôt in the summer
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Marianna: Much
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: I mean you get cold easily
9/26/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: But I don't think it'll be that cold, no
9/26/19, 11:42 AM - Caleb: And if it is, you can borrow mine
9/26/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: There are such things as summer scarves but my mom has more of them so I would just borrow hers
9/26/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: Yeah I was looking at the weather and it doesn‚Äôt look to be that cold but i can‚Äôt really conceptualize 50s rn all I know is it‚Äôs colder
9/26/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking sweater and rain jacket?
9/26/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: Yep
9/26/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: That sounds golden
9/26/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: Definitely a rain jacket
9/26/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: And can't go wrong with a sweater
9/26/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so weird the weather in Budapest and up by school is so different
9/26/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Okay that will be my plan then
9/26/19, 11:44 AM - Caleb: Wait, like by your school?
9/26/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Yeah
9/26/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: It was so cloudy and dreary and much colder up there
9/26/19, 11:45 AM - Marianna: And I get off the metro in the city and I‚Äôm blinded by the sun it‚Äôs a nice temp in my rain jacket
9/26/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Ah!  Caamp is coming to the 9:30 club in dc but dec 15 so I won‚Äôt be back yet :(
9/26/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: NOOO
9/26/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: :(
9/26/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Thats right, I forgot that you get back stupidly late
9/26/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Almost Christmas, right?
9/26/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think I land dec 21 if not 22
9/26/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Which kind of sucks because I like working at Williams Sonoma the week before Christmas
9/26/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: But I may still work there for 3 days and then tell them I‚Äôm home most of January too if they‚Äôd need me (which they haven‚Äôt really in the past)
9/26/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Wait
9/26/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Most of January
9/26/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: What
9/26/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Also, yeah that kinda sucks, but I'm sure if you want, they would hire you right before Christmas! Tons of last minute shoppers
9/26/19, 12:12 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure they will
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: That's going to be brutal though, basically landing and then starting work?
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: I have been doing it for 3 years now (or this December would be)
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: I love the fast paced of it though
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: I feel like I'm going to get back and just want to sleep for like 3 days
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Ah, yeah, that's fair
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: That might happen
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: It's wild that I'm basically done at the end of November
9/26/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Then it's just classes wrapping up and a final here and there until the 13th
9/26/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: I mean I do too, but also you gotta breath sometimes Marianna
9/26/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll probably say I can do the shifts until 2 am because the mall stays open that late right before Christmas
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Ah yes, really take advantage of that jet lag
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Marianna: That seems crazy to me you get done so EARLY
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Hey, who knows, maybe I'll do some last minute shopping and need something from Williams Sonoma
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: ... In Maryland
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: ... For some reason
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: And I KNOW
9/26/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Like what
9/26/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: That's gonna be here soon
9/26/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: It's almost October
9/26/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: I really like it and it keeps me busy so I probably wouldn‚Äôt mind not sleeping
9/26/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: Woah
9/26/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: Crazy
9/26/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: Yeap
9/26/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: And October is basically no school for me
9/26/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Midterms are like the next two weeks
9/26/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah you said
9/26/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Yeah I only have one week of actual class
9/26/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: Oof I‚Äôm not getting in the middle of studying am I?
9/26/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Hey don't worry about it
9/26/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: I wouldn't be studying anyway or something
9/26/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs fair
9/26/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Also
9/26/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: It's kinda making me sad
9/26/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Because I'll only be home for three weeks
9/26/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: And apparently Josh isn't coming home for Christmas
9/26/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: Awww im sorry :(
9/26/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: Does he usually?
9/26/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: I guess I‚Äôll only be home for 3 weeks too
9/26/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/26/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: I this is the first Christmas without him
9/26/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: But I guess it's a long trip from Sac, and also he works sound for a lot of churches in the area, so he'll be needed for Christmas services
9/26/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs gonna be weird
9/26/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: But yeah I would bet he has his reasons
9/26/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Like those are good reasons to not fly 12 hours round trips
9/26/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs probably still hard to not have it
9/26/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/26/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Saturday night
9/26/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: How would you feel about going to an ice bar
9/26/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: Also, Budapest, dinner cruise?
9/26/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: Ooooh Sarah and I we‚Äôre gonna do one in Amsterdam so we‚Äôre definitely down to do one in Copenhagen
9/26/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: I was gonna wear a skirt out Saturday though so I might have to rethink that
9/26/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: And I hadn‚Äôt thought of dinner cruise!  I can definitely see what‚Äôs up with it here!
9/26/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Also, you know how I mix up my p and m
9/26/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: The variables I‚Äôve having to code with are kap, kam, kbp, and kbm
9/26/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not gonna go well I can already guarantee I‚Äôm gonna mistype a letter
9/26/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: Caleb I‚Äôm such a dumbass
9/26/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: I worked on code last night and I was like it‚Äôs not generating anything!  It should definitely pop out a solution!
9/26/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: But I was just writing the FUNCTION without having ANY function calls
9/26/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: So I feel better now
9/26/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Ah
9/26/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: A classic blunder
9/26/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Also I'm making a presentation on Beowulf
9/26/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Oh and did it work once you called it? That's the dream
9/26/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: UPDATE
9/26/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: FINISHED HOMEWORK DUE OVER THE WEEKEND
9/26/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: ironically the last two things I had to do took me the least amount of time and were the easiest
9/26/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: And no
9/26/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: It still didn‚Äôt work
9/26/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: But I got it I think
9/26/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: It prints pretty graphs of concentrations of reactants in a catalyzed reaction
9/26/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: ... Holy shit
9/26/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: Did you make the graphics yourself? Or are you using libraries?
9/26/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: And can you change the order of the reaction?
9/26/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: That's mad impressive
9/26/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Stop being so cool
9/26/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: I used python functions
9/26/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: And idk man
9/26/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt think so
9/26/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: All I can do is change the original starting concentration
9/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Still
9/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Very
9/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Cool
9/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Also class is starting but I'll talk to you later
9/26/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Have fun
9/26/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Be smart
9/26/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: Thanks mom
9/26/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: Will do
9/26/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: He also actually hasn't quite started yet
9/26/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Ok nvm
9/26/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: No phone!
9/26/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Class!
9/26/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Focus!
9/26/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre doing great!  You‚Äôre so close to Friday!
9/26/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Oh I walked into the yoga studio and it smells so nice like they have an aroma thing doing the essential oil vape it‚Äôs a new teacher so I‚Äôm interested to see how this class goes because everyone has different styles
9/26/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: We're doing kahoot rn but have fun!
9/26/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: But it makes me miss my essential oil diffuser (i remember the word now. Not vape. Diffuser)
9/26/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: I GET IT YOU VAPE
9/26/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/26/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: Update
9/26/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: I was trying to do laundry, but all washers were reserved and full tonight
9/26/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: And I was trying to wash my sheets, which I put in my dirty laundry bag this morning
9/26/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: And they weren't dirty before, but they're DEFINITELY dirty now, so I guess I'll be sleeping with my fuzzy blanket tonight
9/26/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Oof
9/26/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Well I suppose as long as I don‚Äôt have to sleep on dirty sheets I‚Äôm fine
9/26/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/26/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: So you have like 28 hours
9/26/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: That was the idea
9/26/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: But hey it's all good, I have an actual reservation now
9/26/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: I don't like the way they do laundry here honestly
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Update I bought Sarah flowers to cheer her up but it was kind of dumb because we leave tomorrow oh well
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: Awww
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: That's still super sweet of you
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: You need a reservation to do laundry?
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: Is she having a rough time still?
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Family member passed away today
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: I'm so sorry
9/26/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Not one she‚Äôs super close to but she got a text during class
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: Oh no
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: So I haven‚Äôt seen her yet
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: :(
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Plus she loves flowers
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: You have a lot of work tonight?
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: No!
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Done!
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: You should go do something with her then
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: That might cheer her up
9/26/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Just packing and gonna try to do an application
9/26/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: We were gonna go out tonight
9/26/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Hey! Sounds like a good way to pick up spirits
9/26/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Pun fully intended
9/26/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: But she was also going to hang with Mark tonight but idk if there are any plans really
9/26/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Yes yes
9/26/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Welcome to my flat
9/26/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Tonight is breakfast for dinner
9/26/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: OOOOOOOOOOOOH
9/26/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm jealous
9/26/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: I mean mines gonna be leftover tikka masala
9/26/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: We've worked out an awesome plan
9/26/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: Basically, we all want fresh food and good hot meals every night
9/26/19, 7:36 PM - Caleb: And leftovers spoil fast
9/26/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Leftovers don‚Äôt spoil fast
9/26/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Like a week
9/26/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Also finish this story and then I have an update didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt
9/26/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Sorry I didn't finish
9/26/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: So we have a pool of people who cook for everyone, once in about a week and a half someone buys the groceries and cooks for everyone, then the other people clean up
9/26/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: And you only need to do it once in a while, so the rest of the time it's just free meals and dishes
9/26/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: That is a good system
9/26/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm fine with cooking all the time as long as I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the hired help to cook all the time you know
9/26/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: I now feel bad for my parents who come home and cook every other night
9/26/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah, yeah that's tough
9/26/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: I enjoy cooking, but not when I'm super busy
9/26/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: I just don't have energy to do it really
9/26/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: I guess it's just not super relaxing for me
9/26/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mind it except when I have other things I also need to do
9/26/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Oh also Sarah and my update is we have a sugar daddy
9/26/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Please ask me to elaborate it‚Äôs a great story
9/26/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/26/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: I'm happy for you
9/26/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: ... I think
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: No no you gotta ask what the fuck I could possibly mean that doesn‚Äôt sound like either of us?!?!
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: No no
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: What
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: You've made your decision and I respect it
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Why noooooo
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Nooooo
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Listen
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Please
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Ask
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: I'm happy for you if this is what you want
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a fun story
9/26/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Hey
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: I mean a result is a result
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre really not getting the best part though
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Ah you see it's all good though
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Whyyyyy
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Because I also have a sugar daddy
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: SURPRISE
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Okay wait now I want an elaboration
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Well mines just a joke
9/26/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Idk about yours though
9/26/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: Well you‚Äôd find out if you asked
9/26/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: ü§ê
9/26/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Hey man I don't ask questions that I don't want to know the answer to...
9/26/19, 7:49 PM - Marianna: This is frustrating I‚Äôm gonna go do intern apps then
9/26/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: NOO
9/26/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Okay
9/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry I was just joking around
9/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: So
9/26/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: What's the story behind your sugar daddy?
9/26/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Oh wow I‚Äôm so glad you asked!
9/26/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Sorry üôÉ
9/26/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Ha
9/26/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: You know how to work me
9/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: So there‚Äôs this guy at one of grocery stores near us who always works at checkout and he‚Äôs very chatty and he always asks for Sarah and my number and stuff and like where were from and we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs creepy or just being friendly but today he did it again but it was both of us and he asked the same questions and was like ah for pretty girls you get more chocolate and gave us free chocolate
9/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: So literally sugar
9/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs funny
9/26/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre not gonna complain if we get chocolate out of it
9/26/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: HA
9/26/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: Yeah I wouldn't either
9/26/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: I'd honestly be disappointed in you if you _didn't_ use that to get free chocolate
9/26/19, 8:16 PM - Caleb: Oh hey also, if you're working on cover letters or essays for the apps, and you want me to check them out, let me know! I love writing
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Ha thank you for the support
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Also please don‚Äôt support me if I want a real sugar daddy
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah I don't think I would sorry about that
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Like don‚Äôt judge but don‚Äôt support
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: I uh, may judge a little bit
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: This is good! Decision! Semester!
9/26/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: Just a _smidgen_
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: And I just wrote one for yelp
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: A sprinkle of judgment, but mostly support
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not too different than my base cover letter so I just sent it to my parents
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: But like emotionally because you've got to be in a bad place to do that
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: True
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Ok!
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: That's awesome
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs never get to that place
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what I vote
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: So I'm curious, why yelp?
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: And yep
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Yep
9/26/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Good call
9/26/19, 8:28 PM - Marianna: Because they‚Äôre in California and have a backend internship I maybe have a shot at
9/26/19, 8:28 PM - Marianna: And as much as I didn‚Äôt like molly she said it was a really fun place to work
9/26/19, 8:28 PM - Marianna: And a friend here also interned there and said it was good
9/26/19, 8:29 PM - Marianna: And I want to work for companies I use products from and yelp is actually a pretty good asset to society I feel like
9/26/19, 8:29 PM - Marianna: At least foodies maybe
9/26/19, 8:29 PM - Marianna: Oh I should put that in a foodie in the cover letter
9/26/19, 8:29 PM - Marianna: Or nah?
9/26/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: Well I've never used to it for food
9/26/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: Or anything really
9/26/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: So I wouldn't know
9/26/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: But I don't think it would hurt to give a specific example of you using and enjoying their product
9/26/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: It would make your app go a long way past the people who just copied and pasted from Google
9/26/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Also
9/26/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Update
9/26/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Now I'm eating Ben and Jerry's and watching The Office with friend
9/26/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: While trying to read 18 chapters of a ancient Norse saga
9/26/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: I can tell you you are going to fail at one of those things
9/26/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre like mutually exclusive
9/26/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: D I S J O I N T
9/26/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: S E T S
9/26/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: But yeah I've done about a chapter
9/26/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: Oh man my mom just sent a picture of me from 3 years ago today
9/26/19, 8:46 PM - Caleb: It's surreal to look at
9/26/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Why did you have to read 18 chapters that‚Äôs obscene
9/26/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Let me see!
9/26/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Pwwwwease
9/26/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: Well
9/26/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: Only because I could feel you bat your eyes
9/26/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: It's like the eye roll, but persuasive
9/26/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: I feel like I don‚Äôt bat my eyes too much
9/26/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: And woah
9/26/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: You look so young
9/26/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: That was three years ago?
9/26/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: That's what my mom said, but I think it is older
9/26/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Probably 4 or 5
9/26/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: I guess 2016
9/26/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: I would reciprocate but I don‚Äôt have anything older than 2017 on my phone
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Because I would have been 18 if it was 3 years ago, and I would be aged out of scouts
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: And awwwww
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: That's a shame
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: I lied
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: I feel like I've seen 0 pictures of young you
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: WAIT
9/26/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Plleeeeeeease
9/26/19, 8:54 PM - Marianna: Okay but only because I like this picture and wish it was more recent so I could use it in things
9/26/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: Okay sure I'll take it
9/26/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: This is not andiamo
9/26/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: This is andiamos predecessor and my mom‚Äôs camera
9/26/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: Taken at money‚Äôs garden
9/26/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: Still have the outfit though
9/26/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I don‚Äôt realize how long I‚Äôve had clothes until I look at photos and realize I still have a dress I wore in 8th grade
9/26/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: Wait how old is that picture?
9/26/19, 8:57 PM - Marianna: A little over 3 years
9/26/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: Awwwwww
9/26/19, 8:57 PM - Marianna: August 2016
9/26/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: Adorable
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: You look really different
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: I can't totally pin what it is though
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: I feel like I don‚Äôt
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Your facial shape?
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Your hair is WAY longer too
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also a mirror so it‚Äôs flipped
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Wait
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: It doesn‚Äôt look that different to me
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Are those the sunglasses you always wear
9/26/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: But I also think I look good in it so maybe I just want to think that
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: Got them when I got my drivers license
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: Woah those have been around for a while
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: Okay then
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: I can TOTALLY one up you with old photos though
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm telling you I have a lot of clothes but I don‚Äôt buy a lot of clothes I just keep old ones and it‚Äôs worked out pretty well so far
9/26/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: Oh and also I love the scarf you're wearing
9/26/19, 9:00 PM - Marianna: I brought that one with me to Budapest !
9/26/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Note: it is sparkling grape juice
9/26/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: It was for a party my friends and I threw called "Fancy-fest"
9/26/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: All our parties were super official and ended in "fest"
9/26/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: I should tell you about them sometime
9/26/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: It was my moms and I LOVED it  and always wore it and then I found it wrapped with a note saying she‚Äôs be sad to see me and the scarf parted
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I think I've mentioned Pasta-fest?
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: AWWWWWWWWW
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: THATS
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: SO
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: CUTE
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Like it was just in my suitcase when I unpacked freshman year
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Oof yes you look young in that one
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: STOP MY HEART CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Dapper
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: But young
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve heard of fancy fest
9/26/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard of pasta fest
9/26/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Ah, well definitely remind me to tell you sometime
9/26/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: It started out as just an excuse for me and my friends to eat too many carbs
9/26/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: And then it was annual, and 4 years later I think we had like 100 something people in attendance
9/26/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Had a website and everything
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: WHAT
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: I want to hear this it sound legendary
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: But hey guess what
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: You can tell me tomorrow!
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Chick butt
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs pasta for some pillow talk?
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Oh wait that's way better than chicken butt
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Oh
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Pasta is 100% pillow talk appropriate
9/26/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: I hope we have enough time
9/26/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: But also I'm FULLY expecting to be super tired for my field study on Saturday
9/26/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: And that's a-okay by me
9/26/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: You betcha
9/26/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah I decided to maybe sleep extra tonight because idk what the next two days will be like
9/26/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: I also just don‚Äôt sleep well in new places
9/26/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Oh

9/26/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: Well gee thanks
9/26/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: I was expecting you‚Äôd kick me out because you‚Äôd be tired of my talking
9/26/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: But I also will probably be drunk when trying to go to bed so that will make it easier
9/26/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: It will be a fight if you vs the alcohol
9/26/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: Who will win
9/26/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: Will Marianna stay up or will she put the face down?
9/26/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: (She‚Äôs gonna try not to put the face down)
9/26/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Well if you need to sleep you need to sleep and I won't blame you
9/26/19, 9:14 PM - Caleb: Oh man now I'm looking through old pictures and finding gems
9/26/19, 9:14 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs the one with pink hair now?
9/26/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: No don‚Äôt let me sleep
9/26/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd rather be sleep deprived this weekend
9/26/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the coffee in Copenhagen
9/26/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: Hmm
9/26/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: Expensive
9/26/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: But I'll do my best to keep you up, I'll just talk your ear off
9/26/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Then you can kick ME out!
9/26/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: And idk
9/26/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: I don't think is hair is pink
9/26/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: I think it's white?
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: Oh dyed though
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: I thought like light pink
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: But I never saw it in elrson I suppose
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: I think my mom took that
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: Woah he does kind of look like you
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Woah what
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: I don't see it
9/26/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: Like not twins but I can see you‚Äôre related
9/26/19, 9:19 PM - Marianna: Well I can
9/26/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Wow
9/26/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: I just realized you've seen like no pictures of my family
9/26/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôve sent odd ones here and there
9/26/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: I think I could picture your mom out of a lineup
9/26/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Hang on
9/26/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Those are my parents
9/26/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Awwww
9/26/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Oh and I‚Äôve seen your dad with red hair
9/26/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Probably one of the only ones tbh
9/26/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: And woah that's right you have
9/26/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: You're the rare soul that's seen my dad with hair
9/26/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs a good picture
9/26/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Oh the old glasses!
9/26/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: Almost didn‚Äôt recognize you
9/26/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: Ahaaaaa
9/26/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: Almost?
9/26/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: And that picture was actually taken in the town in Sweden my parents used to live in!
9/26/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: I figured because you were drinking
9/26/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got those deductive reasoning skills
9/26/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt have any of the four of us on my phone
9/26/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: Aha, yes, but you wouldn't know they lived there
9/26/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: Or at least recent
9/26/19, 9:26 PM - Marianna: No but I could guess it was Sweden‚Äôs
9/26/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Honestly it would be fun to just have you go through all the pictures on my phone sometime, and I can tell stories and background to them all
9/26/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Kinda like I guess I made you do the first time I was in your room, but yours were printed hahaha
9/26/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Oh !  I‚Äôve seen that photo before!
9/26/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah haha
9/26/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: My phone photos are less fun
9/26/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Many more screenshots of instagram
9/26/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: And homework photos
9/26/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Also I changed my mind and am not gonna bring towel or shampoo because I don‚Äôt want to pack it because Sarah and I are taking one bag. It that okay?
9/26/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah that's totally fine by me as long as you don't mind sharing a towel I guess
9/26/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: It'll be clean since I'm washing it tonight/tomorrow, but also I could probably use another so I suppose I could go to H&M tomorrow or something
9/26/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: No no don‚Äôt buy one on account for me
9/26/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm fine with sharing
9/26/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: My philosophy is towels are usually clean because you just got out of the shower right?
9/26/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: So I don‚Äôt mind sharing but if you don‚Äôt want to, I know some people don‚Äôt, just let me know and I can bring one
9/26/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: Oh, that's how _you_ use you towel?
9/26/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: Well this is just awkward
9/26/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how I use me towel
9/26/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/26/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Um how exactly do you use your towel
9/26/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Or do o not want to know
9/26/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: _Dear user, if you're receiving this message..._
9/26/19, 10:02 PM - Marianna: Oh okay I‚Äôll pack a towel
9/26/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Kidding kidding
9/26/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: I'm not really sure how else you'd use a towel
9/26/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Except middle school where they were used for welts
9/26/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Anyway, how's your night been?
9/26/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Welts?
9/26/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: And good!  Pretty much packed but I need to shower and paint my nails
9/26/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: And then sleep
9/26/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah, welts
9/26/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Like you'd make your towel wet, ring it out, curl it, and use it as a whip against your friends
9/26/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: And it would leave welts
9/26/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Boys are cruel and dumb
9/26/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: And oooo sounds fun
9/26/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Glad you're getting to bed soon
9/26/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Also I may be in luck
9/26/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: It seems like there are a couple open driers
9/26/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Oh
9/26/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Boys are weird
9/26/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Uh Caleb don‚Äôt you need washing machines before driers?
9/26/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah I meant washing machine
9/26/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: But I have one! And will have clean sheets and everything!
9/26/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: I need to change it over in like 15 minutes, and hopefully I'll be able to put my sheets back on by midnight then shleep
9/26/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Yay!
9/26/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Love clean sheets
9/26/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Low key I can‚Äôt wait to meet this fuzzy blanket if yours
9/26/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: Well it can't wait to meet you either
9/26/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: So it works out
9/26/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: By the way, can you send your flight information?
9/26/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
9/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I think the D number at the top is the flight
9/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Idk where else to find it
9/26/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: I need to sleep
9/26/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: But I just painted my nails
9/26/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Why do I do this to myself
9/26/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Because we suffer for fashion Marianna
9/26/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: It's as simple as that
9/26/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Also, random question, what's your favorite way to enjoy Rum
9/26/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Uh
9/26/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre right
9/26/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: White rum-mojitos 
Dark/spiced rum-with ginger ale
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Aye
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Aye
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Captain
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: ‚õµ
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Or well spiced is great in chai tea lattes too
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Or you know I could just drink rum straight
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I bought little Smirnoff bottles for the plane right
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: üòÇ
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: I'm well aware of your capacity to drink a large portion of a handle of rum
9/26/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: :)
9/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: :))
9/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry :)
9/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: But! This is about enjoyment
9/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: I'll pick up some ginger ale or ginger beer if I can find it
9/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: I'm just teasing! I honestly have 0 hard feelings, don't worry
9/26/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: If you want me to stop bringing it up I totally will by the way, just let me know
9/26/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah but I‚Äôm still not happy at myself for that night soooo
9/26/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Nah it‚Äôs fine
9/26/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: I forgive you
9/26/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: I know you‚Äôre not mad
9/26/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: So forgive yourself
9/26/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: It was just wasn‚Äôt a high point
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Nah I need to know I can‚Äôt do that again
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: That's okay
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Then forgive yourself and still learn
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm still upset I did it
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not like a forgive or not thing
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Hey
9/26/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: No sad
9/26/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: No upset
9/26/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Moving on
9/26/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Like I had a billion reasons why it happened
9/26/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: But no no Idk how to explain it but I still need to feel bad about it so I don‚Äôt do it again
9/26/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the only way I stop doing stuff
9/26/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Personally I guess
9/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Sounds kinda unhealthy
9/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: I mean, I guess if it's what needs to happen?
9/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: I'm not gonna act like I know what's right or wrong, I just don't want to see you be hard on yourself
9/26/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm allowed to be hard on myself?
9/26/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: If it‚Äôs how I grow and learn
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs not self loathing
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah, but it still hurts me to see if you're too hard
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just like marianna don‚Äôt go back there. Ever. Please.
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: And it's obviously not about hurting me
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: No no don't apologize
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: If it makes you feel better it doesn‚Äôt hurt me to think like this
9/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: It just is sad because I'm the same way
9/26/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: And I know it can really, really suck to be in a place like that, especially if you feel like you're stuck in your own world of thoughts like that
9/26/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Okay yeah I can def think about some times when I‚Äôve done that but that‚Äôs not now I promise
9/26/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: This is something that I accept happened and just dont even want to see myself do again because that wasn‚Äôt me
9/26/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm mad at the not me I think
9/26/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: And that motivates the me to not be not me
9/26/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: If that makes any sense without sounding like I need to go to a psychiatrist
9/26/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I also think that this probably isn't an ideal conversation to have over text
9/26/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: But hey, I just want you to know that you're still pretty gosh darn great
9/26/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: Anyway, nails almost dry? What color did you pick?
9/26/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Yeah probably not
9/26/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Just know I‚Äôm good rn don‚Äôt worry
9/26/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: But thank you
9/26/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôre pretty gosh darn great too
9/26/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: And yeah almost

9/27/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your night been?
9/27/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Well
9/27/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: I've been waiting for laundry to dry
9/27/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: And not working ahead
9/27/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Although I REALLY should be
9/27/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: But hey it'll all be fine right?
9/27/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: Yeah

9/27/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt work ahead and it sucked for like 4 days but I‚Äôm Golden now!

9/27/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Which song?
9/27/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: I'm hanging out in the laundry room alone, I might as well play something
9/27/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Well that was blown away
9/27/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Really good stuff on that entire album
9/27/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt heard it in so long
9/27/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Sydney wrote an article about female power ballads basically so I went through them because you know me I love my secret bad bitch anthems
9/27/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: I saw that!
9/27/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: So I added some from her article
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: Oh Sydney
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: So cool
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Blown away wasn‚Äôt on there but another on that album was but I love blown away so I gave it a play too
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Yeah
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Low key miss her
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: She was so good to me this summer
9/27/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: I think I would have died if it had stayed just me and molly and Mathilde
9/27/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: Yeah that would have been a lot to handle
9/27/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: She was the bastion of sanity in that apartment
9/27/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: You guys should totally see each other again
9/27/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: Maybe road trip to Georgia!
9/27/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Well she said she might want to be in dc again next summer
9/27/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Oh I just crawled in bed but I can still feel like my muscles humming from yoga it‚Äôs so great and warm
9/27/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Idk how else to describe it
9/27/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: Okay now I‚Äôm gonna sleep
9/27/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: I hope your laundry is done soon and I‚Äôll see you TONIGHT
9/27/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: Laundry done for a bit
9/27/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: Cozy in bed
9/27/19, 1:01 AM - Caleb: Warm sheets are amazing
9/27/19, 1:01 AM - Caleb: I'll see you later :)
9/27/19, 7:00 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah warm sheets are nice
9/27/19, 7:00 AM - Marianna: Honestly just warm laundry is nice
9/27/19, 7:00 AM - Caleb: Wosh
9/27/19, 7:00 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not above cuddling my clean clothes
9/27/19, 7:00 AM - Caleb: Woah
9/27/19, 7:00 AM - Caleb: Good morning
9/27/19, 7:01 AM - Caleb: Sorry I literally just woke up
9/27/19, 7:01 AM - Caleb: Uncanny timing
9/27/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: Me too man
9/27/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: Well I woke up at 6
9/27/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: But fell back asleep this time
9/27/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: Did not sleep great though
9/27/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: And well it is 7 am
9/27/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: Did you or did you not have a 7 am alarm
9/27/19, 7:05 AM - Caleb: Okay when you put it like that, it's a lot less uncsnnyv
9/27/19, 7:06 AM - Caleb: Oh man you should see me trying to type right now
9/27/19, 7:13 AM - Marianna: Sorry didn‚Äôt mean to burst your magic bubble
9/27/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: Whyyyy can you not type?
9/27/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: I feel like you can usually type in the morning
9/27/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: Well the end result is usually fine
9/27/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: But the process to get there?
9/27/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: Whew
9/27/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: It's a wild ride
9/27/19, 7:26 AM - Marianna: Well
9/27/19, 7:26 AM - Marianna: Thank you for such an effort to make me be able to read what you‚Äôre saying
9/27/19, 7:27 AM - Marianna: Mines usually pretty fine
9/27/19, 7:27 AM - Marianna: I lean heavily on autocorrect
9/27/19, 7:27 AM - Marianna: Which does usually know what I‚Äôm talking about
9/27/19, 7:29 AM - Caleb: Oh if I'm drunk, tired, or waking up, my auto correct is like "uhhhh your guess is as good as mine"
9/27/19, 7:40 AM - Marianna: @calebsautocorrect YOU HAD ONE JOB
9/27/19, 7:40 AM - Marianna: I guess you just don‚Äôt connect like me and my autocorrect does
9/27/19, 7:40 AM - Marianna: Do**
9/27/19, 7:40 AM - Marianna: That was me not autocorrect
9/27/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: Hmmmm
9/27/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: Yeah sounds fake
9/27/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: You're taking the fall for your autocorrect
9/27/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: I just throw mine under the bus
9/27/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Yeah no that was me not remembering grammar and how verbs work
9/27/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: It job is just words not grammar
9/27/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: Anywho what‚Äôs going on for you today?  Just classes?  Do you have to present your Beowulf thing?
9/27/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: Also tell me to tell you about my Beowulf thing from high school
9/27/19, 8:31 AM - Caleb: Well I just got an email back from Penn and the final test thing I needed isn't what I needed, so I've got to deal with that
9/27/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: Final test thing?
9/27/19, 8:31 AM - Caleb: And I need to pick up my visa
9/27/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: Yeah it was a statistical test telling me that my results were valid and normally distributed
9/27/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: Some were and some weren't
9/27/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: So I gotta deal with that
9/27/19, 8:33 AM - Caleb: So I've got two classes, a visa pickup, another class which I'm presenting in, then I need to go get groceries and then probably just do work until you get here
9/27/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Oh visa is exciting though!
9/27/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Sorry you‚Äôve got a busy day üòê
9/27/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: And how exactly do you deal with the test being wrong?
9/27/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: Run another test or change code?
9/27/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: You know
9/27/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: I'm not sure
9/27/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: I emailed my boss
9/27/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: But it's like 2am there so I'll just make the other edits while I wait
9/27/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: It might just be a "mention the issue in the paper and fix it in the future" type deal
9/27/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Oh that sounds like a fun deal
9/27/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: I should try that on my next theory homework
9/27/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm honestly amazed I got everything done in time this week
9/27/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/27/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Oh hell
9/27/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: More complications with Visa
9/27/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Isn't ready today, it needed to be shipped to the embassy because it's American
9/27/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: And they I can pick it up Monday afternoon, but they're closed Tuesday through Friday
9/27/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Ooooh cool
9/27/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Darn about the visa though
9/27/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry if Budapest is complicating things
9/27/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: No worries! I guess it's mostly out of my hands now
9/27/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: Hopefully I'll get it on Monday, otherwise I'll have a LOT of things to figure out very quickly
9/27/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Yeeeeeeaaaaah
9/27/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Hey you got this
9/27/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt fret
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Have you done you‚Äôre presentation?
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Your**
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Yes! I have!
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: It was great
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Okay my autocorrect fucked up
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Yay!!!
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: It went really really well
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: So are you done for the day?
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Yep
9/27/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Heading home on the metro now
9/27/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: It was hilarious, I'll have to tell you about it later
9/27/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Are you done for the day?
9/27/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Nope
9/27/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre going on a field trip to the grocery store though
9/27/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve only got an hour of class left
9/27/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: So close!
9/27/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/27/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôm wandering a grocery store
9/27/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: How down would you be to watch a kind of obscure thriller/comedy Hungarian movie about our metro system from 2003 with English subtitles when you‚Äôre here
9/27/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: Because I have never been so intrigued by a plot before
9/27/19, 3:57 PM - Caleb: I'd be more down than the titanic
9/27/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: Oh no
9/27/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: That is a bad analogy
9/27/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: No good
9/27/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: Darn
9/27/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: 107 years and still too soon
9/27/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: I totally regretted it the second I hit send but oh well
9/27/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: That's life
9/27/19, 4:18 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
9/27/19, 4:18 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt have to regret it
9/27/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Minutes are passing glacially over here
9/27/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Also I like the word glacially
9/27/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Did you
9/27/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Did you just make a glacier pun after I made a shirt titanic joke?
9/27/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: Also yeah, these days are always the worst
9/27/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: In terms of overall just slowness
9/27/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
9/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Ah
9/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: I did
9/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Not on purpose
9/27/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôm just that good at this stuff
9/27/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Good!
9/27/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt actually learn anything
9/27/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: But I just ate some chicken masala while watching Jane the virgin chilling in a comfy study room at school
9/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: You know
9/27/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: That's starting to sound suspiciously unlike school
9/27/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Well it wasn‚Äôt class
9/27/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Sarah has class until 6 and I don‚Äôt so I just chilled
9/27/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Also
9/27/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: On our way to the airport!
9/27/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: WOOOHOOO

9/27/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Night is young Marianna
9/27/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Also
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: According to my delicious mocca that I paid more than I should have in Hungary for, yes
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Hi hi means goodbye!
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: In Danish at least
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: What?
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: No way
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: If you say "Hi hi!", you're literally saying "bye bye"
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: We say hello for a greeting and goodbye here
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Oh cool
9/27/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Well I won‚Äôt do that I suppose
9/27/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: So
9/27/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: How's the airport life?
9/27/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good
9/27/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the Copenhagen life
9/27/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: I ate too much
9/27/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: Now tummy hurts
9/27/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: Want nap
9/27/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: Can't nap
9/27/19, 8:41 PM - Caleb: But good!
9/27/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: Why no nap
9/27/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry about the tummy
9/27/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: I ate half a brownie and knew I wouldn‚Äôt feel good if I kept it
9/27/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: So now it‚Äôs traveling with me as hopefully a treat for drunk marianna
9/27/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
9/27/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Don't over eat
9/27/19, 8:45 PM - Caleb: I've got snacks at my apartment though
9/27/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Booooo over eating
9/27/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Oh snacks are always good
9/27/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Big fan of snack time
9/27/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: All times are snack times
9/27/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: THE TRUTH
9/27/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Okay maybe not
9/27/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Okay actually yeah I'm basically the opposite of this
9/27/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: If the day picks up, I barely eat
9/27/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: I should probably be better at that
9/27/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Food are friends
9/27/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: ... Not... Fish?
9/27/19, 9:01 PM - Marianna: Not fish
9/27/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: But just to be clear
9/27/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Fish ARE friends
9/27/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: And also good
9/27/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Food

9/27/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Yay
9/27/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Friendship
9/27/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Idk though
9/27/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Meeting strangers on planes is usually pretty fun
9/27/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: I don't think I've ever had a bad experience
9/27/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: But it's always more fun with a friend
9/27/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: I was so glad I got to sit with Hannah on the way here
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like talking with strangers
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: The only time I have on a plane I lied
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Ah that's right
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Throw people off your trail
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: I also would have cried if I said why I was actually visiting California last year
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: I forgot you do that
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: So it was for a lot of reasons
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: :(
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: That's totally fair
9/27/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: We also think no one is sitting next to Sarah so we might have a whole row
9/27/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Am I hearing extra leg room?
9/27/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: I'm hearing leg room
9/27/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Uh I don‚Äôt need extra leg room
9/27/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
9/27/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: She may stay next to me though
9/27/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: So we can drink and listen to music and make this pregame feel like it‚Äôs not on a plane
9/27/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Ooo
9/27/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Fun
9/27/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Basically a private jet?
9/27/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Basically a private jet.
9/27/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: Yes
9/27/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: Basically
9/27/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs actually not bad for our ticket prices

9/27/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Yup
9/27/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Yup

9/27/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Hello yes I got it
9/27/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: But I turned roaming on which will absolutely eat up my data but I am pretty sure it‚Äôs the only way I can use Denmark‚Äôs network as my own

9/28/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: Check under the sink
9/28/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: Like on the actual floor
9/28/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: I know there are some in the other bathroom, it's on the other end of the hall
9/28/19, 9:41 AM - Marianna: Nope but I‚Äôll grab some from the other one
9/28/19, 9:41 AM - Marianna: Also I have heard nothing from Sarah and marion
9/28/19, 9:41 AM - Marianna: Firmly believe they are still asleep
9/28/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: .... Guuuuyyys
9/28/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: I've got recommendations of things for you to do if you want to kill time until they get up
9/28/19, 9:42 AM - Caleb: Or you're more than welcome to just hang out
9/28/19, 9:46 AM - Marianna: Update they‚Äôre up
9/28/19, 9:46 AM - Caleb: Hoooraaaaay
9/28/19, 9:47 AM - Marianna: How are you doing?  How long is the trek out to the place?
9/28/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: It's like a 20 minute car ride
9/28/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: Which is odd because the train takes like 45 minutes
9/28/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: It's funny because it's also about the same distance from my house to Lancaster, so it's basically the commute I used to do every day
9/28/19, 9:55 AM - Caleb: But then we've got a couple other things around this island
9/28/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: That is odd
9/28/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: I guess different routes
9/28/19, 10:21 AM - Marianna: How many islands are there around here?
9/28/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: A bunch
9/28/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: Two main ones though
9/28/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: Zealand (the one we're on), and Jutland, the big one

9/28/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve been trading tea all morning and catching up
9/28/19, 12:39 PM - Marianna: We are now at rosenborg
9/28/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/28/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/28/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: And then saw the graves of King Hrolf Kraki and Hrothgar
9/28/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: And now we're eating lunch in the great feasting hall at Lejre where Beowulf takes place
9/28/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: ... I don't know why I'm sending these, I'll just show you later
9/28/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: WE SHOULD GO TO LOUISIANA
9/28/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: It's right next to Frederiksborg
9/28/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: Hrothgar
9/28/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: Why do I know that name
9/28/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: NO WAY
9/28/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: THE FEASTING HALL
9/28/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: But uh no caleb Louisiana is like 4600 miles from here
9/28/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
9/28/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: And YES WAY
9/28/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: It was super cool
9/28/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: We sat in the ruins and ate lunch there
9/28/19, 1:45 PM - Marianna: No what how is it Louisiana
9/28/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: It's Louisiana because of the way it is
9/28/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: Also update now we're in western Zealand, doing the last thing, visiting an ancient temple to Thor on a lake
9/28/19, 2:27 PM - Caleb: And I had the BEST bus nap
9/28/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: Ooooh
9/28/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: I am pumped to see photos
9/28/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt come today
9/28/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: I have not had a nap though
9/28/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: I wish I could have done both and seen your Nordic stuff and been here in Copenhagen with friends
9/28/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: Oh don't worry, they're all a lot cooler over text
9/28/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Maybe I just won't show you pictures, and that way you can keep the mental image of grand ruins and fantastic halls instead of me standing in a bunch of rural Danish fields
9/28/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: Also, I know you want the most of your time in Copenhagen, but theres like 2 hours where most things are shut done and night life hasn't started yet, so if you want a nap to rally, let me know!
9/28/19, 2:51 PM - Marianna: Okay well I still want to see and hear about it
9/28/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: I may need a nap to rally
9/28/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre currently on our way to nyhavn for a rest in a cafe and walking around and then cisterns and then back to Marion‚Äôs and when you get back, over to reffen for pizza and alcohol bucket according to marion
9/28/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Where are you? Kongens Nytorv?
9/28/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: If you're near norreport, go to Next Door Cafe
9/28/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: The basement is SO cool

9/28/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: Go to Amalianborg, Frederik's Kirke, and the park
9/28/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: And if you're up there, you're kinda closeish to the little mermaid statue
9/28/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Okay we‚Äôre walking that now
9/28/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: Okay so we are getting coffee and we are not gonna get to the cisterns before they close
9/28/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: And Margaux said fredricksborg was underwhelming
9/28/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: So we are just gonna do cisterns tomorrow??
9/28/19, 4:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/1/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Hello
10/1/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: I just switched to a new phone, and I backed up WhatsApp but it's not letting me restore
10/1/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Can you just send all that again?
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: Hello!
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: And hi to new phone!
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: At least I didn‚Äôt get hit with a new phone who dis I suppose
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: Oh yay!
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: To both things!
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: From the sound of it you‚Äôve had a good week so far
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: My mornings been fine
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: Just got done my only class so now we‚Äôre heading back to my apartment for lunch and then working on homework all afternoon
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: Also, I know you may not know but are you planning on just doing day trips mon-wed?  I just need to know by the weekend if you‚Äôll be here to mealplan if you are. And kind of going along with that, would you rather we cook and eat in most nights?  Or do you want to go to some cool Budapest eateries?  I promise you it is gonna be cheaper than anything you‚Äôll find in Copenhagen but if so, I‚Äôm gonna start looking at cool restaurants around and doing reservations so just let me know!
10/1/19, 3:16 PM - Marianna: Personally I was thinking like 2-3 times eating out for the whole week but I also get if you‚Äôd rather not!
10/1/19, 3:17 PM - Marianna: Those last ones were the ones I already sent
10/1/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: Well I'm happy to hear you had a good morning
10/1/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: My morning was an absolute trainwreck but its actually been a great day so it kinda evens out
10/1/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: I can tell you more about it later if you want
10/1/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: And okay, here's what I was thinking for Monday-Wednesday
10/1/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: I'll get up with you and eat breakfast, and then head out for day trips
10/1/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: I was thinking Bratislava on Monday, Vienna on Tuesday (with Sarah if she's still down), and a third
10/1/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Maybe Melk
10/1/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: On Wednesday
10/1/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: I'm planning on being gone all day, but back at night so I can still have time with you but you don't have to plan around me
10/1/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: As for eating, I really want to eat out if the places can be part of the "experience" if that makes sense
10/1/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: But also I'd like to cook with/for you during the week at least a couple times
10/1/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm sorry about your morning!  Everything aight?
10/1/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: And that sounds like a good plan
10/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: People love Bratislava and have done day trips there from here pretty easily
10/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: And that works for me as far as you being gone during the day and food plans
10/1/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll look for some experience Hungarian restaurants
10/1/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: We have a crazy list of them but I‚Äôll find ones that allow you to taste some of the cool things they make here
10/1/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: Awesome! Thank you again for being so great at helping me out with things to do, it really means a lot and I'M SO EXCITED
10/1/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: Also yeah every is alright, it was just a little chaotic
10/1/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: But all is well
10/1/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: And I gonna take a nap
10/1/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: So all will be even better
10/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Hey don‚Äôt thank me yet you don‚Äôt even know what I have planned
10/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Although nothing is set in stone so it an ideal plan for the week really
10/1/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: Weather and time permitting
10/1/19, 3:52 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm jealous have fun at your nap
10/1/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: You better be jealous
10/1/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: I'm already hype for my rally nap and homework
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Caleb: Also, fun news
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: Update Sarah and robin are hanging at a coffee shop and I‚Äôm upset
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Caleb: New phone means I can charge my phone AND listen to music at the same time
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: Because they didn‚Äôt ask me
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Caleb: So I can properly listen to the album every week now
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: And like Sarah knows I don‚Äôt work well in coffee shops
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/1/19, 3:55 PM - Caleb: :(
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: But I like my friends and they didn‚Äôt even put it in the group with the 3 of us
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: And I went home with robin
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Caleb: That's still a really crummy feeling
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Just ticks me off
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: But yay aboot your phone!
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Caleb: Aboot
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt realize you couldn‚Äôt do both at the same time haha
10/1/19, 3:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah I've just been sorta playing it quietly out loud until Reid shows up
10/1/19, 3:57 PM - Caleb: I'm really sorry about the coffee shop though
10/1/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: I'm sure neither of them meant anything by it besides thinking you wouldn't be interested, but no matter what that's not a good feeling
10/1/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Yeah I just like knowing when my friends hang out without me
10/1/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Or maybe I don‚Äôt like knowing
10/1/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: But like if Sarah sent me a yo robins gonna come work that would be different than oh robin met me here
10/1/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Still stings a little
10/1/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: But I know bringing this kind of stuff up would cause more drama without really making me feel any better
10/1/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: But anyway
10/1/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Tell me something that makes you happy to make me happier?
10/1/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Or you don‚Äôt need to I‚Äôm doing mathish stuff that makes me happier
10/1/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: I'll happily tell you things that make me happy
10/1/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: There are so many!
10/1/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: First off, happy I don't have to wait like two months to see you again like I did last time I said bye

10/1/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: But it was free because they are doing a photo shoot for their publicity and like Instagram page
10/1/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm just gonna hope my hickey doesn‚Äôt ruin any photos they got...
10/1/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Also low key hoping they do post some so I can see myself doing J√≥ga!
10/1/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Wow my brain actually typed it in Hungarian
10/1/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: This is bad

10/1/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: No bad
10/1/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Very good

10/1/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: I'm really wishing I took Danish while here
10/1/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Which I technically can do
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: But I can‚Äôt respond if they ask me anything afterwards lol
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Oh really?

10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Depends if they speak slowly and use words I know
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs always Duolingo
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: True true
10/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: But it looked like Danish is not as used there as Hungarian is here
10/1/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah everyone speaks English
10/1/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Like most things are in English as well but it also helps to know Hungarian
10/1/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Or maybe it‚Äôs just fun to know Hungarian
10/1/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: And people apparently enjoy using us as English practice
10/1/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah that's it for me
10/1/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Here people speak to you in Hungarian first and expect you to either look confused or respond back
10/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: There are a lot of people I want to meet
10/1/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Some people have been very willing to try to talk with me
10/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Awwww
10/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: See
10/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: That's awesome
10/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: I just feel bad because if i meet any locals and get to know them, I don't want to severely sway the discussion because I won't understand anything if not in English
10/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: And I REALLY want to meet more people
10/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Like I'd say it's a pretty big part of my personality
10/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: But I don't feel like I can if I don't know Danish
10/1/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: And I look Danish enough that people try to say things to me, and it's just the same repeated awkward encounter of me having to say I don't understand
10/1/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Sorry I feel like I'm complaining
10/1/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: I'm really super impressed by you and your Hungarian though
10/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Aw I‚Äôm sorry
10/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: But I bet some people will still talk to you even if it‚Äôs in English
10/1/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I mean when I hang out with mark and Sarah and marks friends it‚Äôs all English with me soemtimes impressing them and saying something in Hungarian
10/1/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: But also I feel like I‚Äôm hyping it up too much you‚Äôre gonna get here and realize I know random words but can‚Äôt actually speak anything
10/1/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Oh and yeah everyone in Denmark was blond
10/1/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Freaked me OUT
10/1/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Pssshh
10/1/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Malarkey
10/1/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: You're impressive regardless, the Hungarian is the cherry on top
10/1/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: It's just cool to see that you're embracing it so much
10/1/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: I think I'm gonna start packing a lunch and eating on KU's campus
10/1/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: I found out today that you don't need to be a student to go in, and it's really pretty
10/1/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/1/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Maybe I can meet some people there
10/1/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: And I KNOW

10/1/19, 8:53 PM - Caleb: That gives a lazy Saturday morning and I can still get there Sunday afternoon
10/1/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: That works with me if it works with you!
10/1/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: And you‚Äôre sure spyros will be fine with it?

10/1/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: One step at a time
10/1/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Oh I would love that
10/1/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: You got this
10/1/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: Or just having someone sitting over my shoulder telling me to do it and letting me think out loud
10/1/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: I miss having friends to do that most I think like in terms of being away from davidson
10/1/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: Yeah but I need to talk to my mom about them
10/1/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I think I rely on my mom too much for her opinion on things like this but I also think she gives really good advice and it‚Äôs not like shed every be willing to literally do it for me it‚Äôs just helping me logic things out
10/1/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: And she hires interns and people into her working group soooo

10/1/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Bodega?
10/1/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: All I can think of is the corner store delis in New York like in spider man but that doesn‚Äôt seem cozy

10/1/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/1/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Fun fact I cannot actual make calls out from my phone and no one else can either but we don‚Äôt know how to fix it
10/1/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Well
10/1/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: This isn't an ideal time to be tipsy at a bodega
10/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Oh darn no it isn‚Äôt

10/2/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: We can hope
10/2/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: Emailed people about Rec letters being like hi can you please do this ASAP
10/2/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs really not fair to ask them to do that but I don‚Äôt have a choice!  But I feel so rude!  But I literally could not see the app until today!
10/2/19, 12:42 AM - Caleb: Marianna
10/2/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: Still it makes me think they will see it as me slacking and doing things last minute and it being on them now
10/2/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: Ah
10/2/19, 12:42 AM - Caleb: We're doing the best we can
10/2/19, 12:42 AM - Caleb: That's all they can ask
10/2/19, 12:43 AM - Marianna: Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt look like it
10/2/19, 12:43 AM - Marianna: Ah whatever
10/2/19, 12:43 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna shower and then sleep

10/2/19, 12:44 AM - Marianna: Lol and they know I like to procrastinate sadly
10/2/19, 12:44 AM - Caleb: Don't sweat it too much
10/2/19, 12:44 AM - Caleb: It's a super low volume time for rec letters
10/2/19, 12:45 AM - Caleb: Knowing what a delight you are, I'm sure they'll have no trouble writing them
10/2/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: Yeah there‚Äôs nothing I can do now
10/2/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: But not for work for a supervisor or a professor on sabbatical
10/2/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: But whatever
10/2/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: I should stop complaining about this it is fruitless it doesn‚Äôt even make me feel better
10/2/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your stuff going over there?
10/2/19, 12:47 AM - Caleb: Itll work out
10/2/19, 12:47 AM - Caleb: So it's not worth worrying about right now

10/2/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: Things are out of our control at this point, so it's no use to worry about them
10/2/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: ```God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference. ```
10/2/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: (Thanks kurt vonny-g)
10/2/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: I'm a total hypocrite for sending that, but I really do think there's truth there even if I don't follow

10/2/19, 1:04 AM - Marianna: Bed time for me too

10/2/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: But yeah
10/2/19, 8:43 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre going to make it
10/2/19, 8:43 AM - Marianna: Do all the classes have midterms?
10/2/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Idk if this is technically halfway
10/2/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: I got here mid August, and classes are "over" early December
10/2/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Oh
10/2/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Woah
10/2/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Yeah I guess it pretty much is half way since I barely have class in October
10/2/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Sounds pretty halfway to me
10/2/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: :(
10/2/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm both excited for davidson and dreading having to leave
10/2/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Would you be opposed to a very girly pink restaurant the menu looks really interesting and the room looks incredible
10/2/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: Both of those are good things
10/2/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: And no! Not at all
10/2/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: That sounds awesome
10/2/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Update marti made me teach Hungarian class
10/2/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: For like 15 minutes
10/2/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Not hard
10/2/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Not easy I mean
10/2/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Okay I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be the kind of guy who‚Äôd be uncomfy with it but I wanted to make sure
10/2/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: The website is like great for bachelorette parties but also online people say it‚Äôs good for anything it‚Äôs just a fun environment
10/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Jokes on you because pink makes me suUuuuuPeEr unCoMfY
10/2/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: I'll only do it if I can break out the target koi shirt
10/2/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: And also that makes me wonder if we'll get to see a bachelorette party
10/2/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: That would be so entertaining
10/2/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: Dinner and a show
10/2/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah low key I like that about you
10/2/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Maybe koi shirt idk how dressy it is I may dress up just for kicks
10/2/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Or we may not do it. There are a few really bad reviews from sept and oct 2019 already but also some good ones so it might just be luck of the draw
10/2/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs ya day been
10/2/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: What are your studies to today?
10/2/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Speaking of dressy, I actually very much do need to do a little shopping because I have no snappy business casual with me
10/2/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: So if you want to help pick out some shirts I'd appreciate it
10/2/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/2/19, 1:49 PM - Marianna: I can shop
10/2/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Till I drop
10/2/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: When would ya like to?
10/2/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: I also have never shopped for guys clothes besides stuff for my dad so I‚Äôm not sure how much help I‚Äôll be
10/2/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Is this your way of telling that you'll dress me like your dad
10/2/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: And whenever, I don't want it to be like a full day thing
10/2/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: Maybe a day or two
10/2/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: Also marianna
10/2/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: I have some terrible news
10/2/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: No I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd go for his style
10/2/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: At least not at 21
10/2/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: At least I hope
10/2/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: And uh yeah caleb
10/2/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/2/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/2/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/2/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/2/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/2/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna need you to come back so I can show  you this
10/2/19, 2:16 PM - Caleb: Sorry about that
10/2/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh yeah that looks beautiful
10/2/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll pack my bags
10/2/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also unfair though because that‚Äôs nicer weather than we had
10/2/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/2/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: I really wish you could have been here for longer
10/2/19, 2:19 PM - Caleb: And also I'm glad you had lots of friends to visit, but it definitely made it harder to plan
10/2/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: And also the fact that I didn't know some of this existed
10/2/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: That makes it hard too I guess
10/2/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/2/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: There are definitely parts of Budapest I don‚Äôt know about that you just won‚Äôt get to see I‚Äôm sorry :(
10/2/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: So I totally understand
10/2/19, 2:23 PM - Marianna: But I can see through wonderful photos
10/2/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/2/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: Not the same as having you here but I'll take it
10/2/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: How's your day been so far?
10/2/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Oh shit do you know whats happening at davidson?
10/2/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: Stuck on some theory
10/2/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: Not good
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: Tired and worn at working at this
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: And I saw the safer
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: My cats on the ground were hiding around campus
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: I talked to some peeps on campus
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: No idea what happened though
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah they don't either
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: I suspect Davidson will email us?
10/2/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: Like to explain?  Or is that too much to ask
10/2/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Well
10/2/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Its what they _should_ do
10/2/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Idk if it's what will happen
10/2/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: My guess is that if it's nothing, well get an email from Todd
10/2/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: If something happened, it'll be from Quillen
10/2/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: True
10/2/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just so intrigued
10/2/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: And hopefully it was nothing
10/2/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs to hoping Todd sends us another meme
10/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: Man
10/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: That's spooky
10/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: I'm a little shaken up
10/2/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/2/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: Do you remember when the whole nazi stuff came out last year?
10/2/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: I had gotten a heads up the day of earlier and I was like what do you mean Twitter found what
10/2/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: And then within hours a ton of Davidson students had heard and were telling me again
10/2/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/2/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: That was wild
10/2/19, 3:52 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just knocking off balance when that stuff happens somewhere so much like a home
10/2/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: My hall was eerie
10/2/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: I had no clue how to deal with that
10/2/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Like both on a personal level and a HC level
10/2/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: Honestly when I saw the text that was the first thing I thought of
10/2/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I wouldn‚Äôt want to have to be a hall counselor dealing with that no offense
10/2/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Was anyone like exceptionally upset?  Or was it just the general sock
10/2/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Shock
10/2/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: General shock
10/2/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: Anger too
10/2/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: I mean I was angry for a lot of reasons
10/2/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: And so was my hall
10/2/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: People were scared too
10/2/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: No one knew what was next
10/2/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: How's joey?
10/2/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: Have you heard from him?
10/2/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think that‚Äôs how most people were
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: And no
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: His phones pretty busted
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: Not entirely sure it‚Äôs working
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: I assume he‚Äôs alright
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: He wouldn‚Äôt text either way
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs not the kind to check in after that
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Idk
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm not about to text Tom and judy and ask if they‚Äôve heard from him
10/2/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Maybe you should check in anyway
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: My mom would get in the car and be at Davidson by morning
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: As a little brother it would mean a lot to me
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: But idk Joey
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: I figure if he‚Äôs not okay we‚Äôll find out
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: No news is good news I guess
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah not Joey honestly probably wouldn‚Äôt respond
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll snap him but I don‚Äôt know if he can even get snaps
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: I should reach out to Dr. TS
10/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Oh I can davidson email him
10/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: She's the director of the HH
10/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: She's probably got bigger fish to fry right now though
10/2/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/2/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Funny story
10/2/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: When it was happening, I video called Sam Davis
10/2/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: And he was quiet and in a dark place, and it looked like he was laying down
10/2/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: And I was like "hey oh shit you okay", and he was like "yeah I just woke up"
10/2/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: And then I realized he also was naked, and I was like "....oh"
10/2/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: (Actually, disclaimer, it was right after it cleared)
10/2/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: False alarm! Hoooraaay
10/2/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah I doubt she‚Äôs gonna explain to a student if she does know anything
10/2/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Well I was thinking more of a "hey are you okay"
10/2/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: But it was a false alarm anyway
10/2/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And ooof well at least he was okay
10/2/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: I would probably be someone who sleeps through something scary on campus
10/2/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: I think you're the type of person who would sleep through lots of campus events
10/2/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: You do like your sleep
10/2/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: I forgot a raincoat
10/2/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a little chilly
10/2/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm done class!
10/2/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: So I get to go home and clean the kitchen from last night and cook for Sarah who‚Äôs at a cafe!
10/2/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: And I can‚Äôt even be mad because she actually does have homework but also she hung out with mark on Monday and she could have been working now it‚Äôs not my fault her homework due at midnight isn‚Äôt done
10/2/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Oh well
10/2/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: She debated just getting pizza but I don‚Äôt want pizza it‚Äôs just gonna kill my stomach
10/2/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: But my prof helped me figure out something really cool with my minesweeper app homework so that is really almost done. Just adding fun things to it now!  But it‚Äôs functional!
10/2/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm not actually in that bad of a mood
10/2/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been?
10/2/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: "A little chilly"
10/2/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Hey same here
10/2/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: It hailed earlier
10/2/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: I could see my breath
10/2/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: A little too cold and dreary for my taste
10/2/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry about Sarah though, I get that shes busy but also its still not quite fair to you
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: I hope it gets better, and I really hope you don't need to talk with her later
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: My day's been okay
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: I'm wiped
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: Its been thing to thing from 8 until now
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: And I just want to sleep
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: But I still need to do this and then Penn stuff
10/2/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: What about you?
10/2/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: Oh and now I'm sitting in a dimly lit room with my friend trying to study
10/2/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: but Oh gOsH I wAnT tO nAp
10/2/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm really stressed
10/2/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: None of my homework makes sense
10/2/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know what to do
10/2/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Its gonna be okay
10/2/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: When's it due?
10/2/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm talking about like 5 different projects
10/2/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Maybe taking 5 classes was not a great decision
10/2/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/2/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: Maybe not no
10/2/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: But you'll get through it
10/2/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: You should do what I do
10/2/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: Take a stress shower and look at it after
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: :(
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: But I like them
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: I just don‚Äôt like all the homework
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: I guess I could have audited one
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: That's ok
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: Robins coming over to work
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Its pass fail
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Yay!
10/2/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: That is a good point
10/2/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Maybe talking to her will help
10/2/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Even if it's just rubber ducking it
10/2/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: And I really don‚Äôt see myself going to grad school like I do but I think I‚Äôd rather go to industry right afterwards so it doesn‚Äôt totally matter
10/2/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Rubber ducking?
10/2/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: Rubber duck debugging!
10/2/19, 8:19 PM - Marianna: Uh
10/2/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: It's when you explain the issue out loud to an inanimate object like a rubber duck
10/2/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: And it helps you figure out things
10/2/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: I swear it's a real thing
10/2/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
10/2/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: Also
10/2/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: I've run into the issue
10/2/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: I laid down in bed, and started playing the Joy Williams album, and now all I want to do is sleep
10/2/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Oh
10/2/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: I do that to Piglet!
10/2/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: And friends who just don‚Äôt listen
10/2/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: I like the album personally
10/2/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: Oh I really really like the album
10/2/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: Good pick
10/2/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Yayayay
10/2/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Makes me happy
10/2/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Got my music approved by THE caleb Grenko
10/2/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
10/2/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: Such an honor
10/2/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: Also
10/2/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: There's 0% chance you haven't heard this song before, but
10/2/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/3kZC0ZmFWrEHdUCmUqlvgZ?si=5tUwwV9VRjGOvFjLbt9hvQ
10/2/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: I really really love this song
10/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll listen to it
10/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Have heard of death cab for cutie
10/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt think I actually know anything by them though
10/2/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Oh man
10/2/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: 2ell
10/2/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Well*
10/2/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: Let me know what you think
10/2/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: Now I'm nervous
10/2/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/2/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna have to listen to them later
10/2/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm finally cooking
10/2/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs stir fry night
10/2/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Ooo
10/2/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Cooking with marianna?
10/2/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: At 10:30?
10/2/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/2/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/2/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Oh man
10/2/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: That looks goooood
10/2/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: I'm absolutely fried, so I think I'm gonna head to bed
10/2/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I hope your night got better! Don't stress about it too much, you'll figure it out, and it's okay to ask for help
10/2/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Good night! I'll see ya soon :)
10/2/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: It wasn‚Äôt the best
10/2/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: Probably wouldn‚Äôt make it again
10/2/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: But I think I may be spoiled from Judy‚Äôs wok and her Chinese food
10/2/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: All things considered night got a little better thank you
10/2/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Tomorrow I have a lot of work but I think it‚Äôs manageable
10/2/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: I also do have like 4 hours Friday between you getting here and my last class
10/2/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Were you hoping to go out to clubs Friday?  I wasn‚Äôt thinking to so we could get an early start Saturday (and those are pretty much mutually exclusive) but this is your Budapest experience so let me know!
10/3/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: I think I have heard the death cab song before peaceful and eerie and yes Emo but a good one
10/3/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: Okay bedtime for me. I‚Äôll talk to ya tomorrow and weirdly enough see you soon!
10/3/19, 8:09 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry but 50 degrees is just not a thing that should be allowed
10/3/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: Gooooood morning
10/3/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: Friday I was hoping to maybe just go to a ruin bar for a little bit because they seem more laid back, but I wasn't trying to be out late or go clubbing
10/3/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: What were you hoping to do?
10/3/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: And hey! Glad you liked the song
10/3/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Idk, it's one I've listened to forever so maybe its also got a lot of sentimental value to me
10/3/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: Okie dokie!  I‚Äôll find a cool one. Or maybe we‚Äôll start you off with the classic one that isn‚Äôt my favorite but it‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt come to Budapest and not go see it
10/3/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: But everyone knows that so it‚Äôs touristy and more expensive but still a cool place
10/3/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: And um morning?  I just got done my first class it hardly feels like morning
10/3/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Ooooooof and now I‚Äôm walking to the train and it‚Äôs too chilly to not have a sweatshirt or sweater
10/3/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: I do want to get an early start Saturday though so we shouldn‚Äôt stay out tooooo late (or up toooo late were really bad at that)
10/3/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Yeah, yeah we're pretty awful at that
10/3/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: We can set a definite time to leave the appartment
10/3/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Also, as someone who has flown from Cope to Budapest, how early should I get to the airport?
10/3/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Yet are either of us complaining?
10/3/19, 11:33 AM - Marianna: I certainly won‚Äôt at least about the you part. The sleep part I might. You‚Äôve been warned
10/3/19, 11:34 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm kidding I found another place where people also said they had good bar food too. Well make sure to still get you to the classic place
10/3/19, 11:34 AM - Marianna: And uh I don‚Äôt even remember but we waited for a while once we got there
10/3/19, 11:34 AM - Marianna: Security took us less than 10 min though
10/3/19, 11:35 AM - Marianna: And walking to our gate as well and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs universal to start boarding 45 min beforehand
10/3/19, 11:35 AM - Marianna: Also could we talk tonight?  I have some qs about stuff for next week that would be easier not to type I think
10/3/19, 11:35 AM - Marianna: Without ruining any of the secrecy that is
10/3/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: Yeah! I don't have a lot of time because I need to do laundry, pack, take a midterm, and finish stuff for the conference
10/3/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: But I can call if it's quick
10/3/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: Okay!
10/3/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs partially to help ya pack to let you know what you should maybe bring for activities and stuff but I guess you also are gonna have your China stuff too but yeah
10/3/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the day looking?
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: Okay! Sounds good
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: And today's gonna be busy
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: Reeeeall busy
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: I don't know if I'll get everything done
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: But hey
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: I'll do my best
10/3/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: What about you?
10/3/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Hey if I  can do it so can you
10/3/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Ive got all of my compbio, crypto, and finishing mobile to do
10/3/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: And we‚Äôre trying to go to a paint rave tonight!
10/3/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs put on my the Budapest technical institute
10/3/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: By**
10/3/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Kind of dayglow vibes or soemthing
10/3/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Woah
10/3/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: That sounds intense
10/3/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Sounds like a great time though! Have fun
10/3/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: I've only done dayglow once, and it was a pretty awesome time
10/3/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: I think the word "rave" just makes anything sound insane
10/3/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: I just hope I can do work before then
10/3/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: I should be able to
10/3/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: I may still need to do a tiny bit of homework sometime this weekend but I promise we‚Äôll do funstuff
10/3/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: And idk i think other people have been referring to it as a rave so why not
10/3/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Life update from marianna: I‚Äôm bed working on coding python for reprissilator models (idk they‚Äôre bio stuff) and making pretty graphs and I‚Äôve got my pig and I‚Äôm pretty gosh darn content
10/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: V happy for you
10/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Wish I could join you in the cozy and contentness
10/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Sounds hygge :)
10/3/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: And that's no problem! I'll definitely have things to do if you need some time
10/3/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: Oh but you don‚Äôt understand
10/3/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: I cannot be comfy
10/3/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: Especially when equations supposedly representing physical phenomena are resulting in imaginary numbers!
10/3/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: (Or at least that can happen in physics but not bio)
10/3/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm v tired
10/3/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: May lay my head down for a bit honestly
10/3/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhhhhhhhhh
10/3/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: You're telling me that there aren't sqrt(-32x10^4) atoms in a reaction?
10/3/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: Shame
10/3/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: The nap sounds like a good call though
10/3/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: I always do better if I can be productive for shorter amounts of time rather than unproductive for long periods
10/3/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: Uh would you like to know why I did
10/3/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: I said pi
10/3/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Instead of p
10/3/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Because the formula above it had variable pi so I assumed the second would have the same naming mechanism
10/3/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Ah
10/3/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Silly silly
10/3/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Gotta love those mistakes
10/3/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: So easy to fix
10/3/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: So stupid feeling afterwards
10/3/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: So hard to find
10/3/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even care I was stupid I just am relieved it works
10/3/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
10/3/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: Lots and lots of print statements
10/3/19, 3:20 PM - Marianna: Well only 2
10/3/19, 3:20 PM - Marianna: But they were of lists
10/3/19, 3:20 PM - Marianna: Also I just walked into a pole
10/3/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: ...
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: Welcome to my life
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: You can have your life back
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: "Charmingly clumsy"
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: OOF
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: Hey I meant it in the best way possible
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: Suuuuure
10/3/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: I'll have you know I'm having a great life right now
10/3/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: Thank you very much
10/3/19, 3:22 PM - Marianna: Oh course
10/3/19, 3:22 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre life ain‚Äôt bad
10/3/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôd rather not run into poles all the time
10/3/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a deal breaker for me
10/3/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: Luckily all that means is I won‚Äôt steal your identity and assume your life
10/3/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: Also speaking of being clumsy
10/3/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: Joey went to the hospital and got 6 stitches on Tuesday
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: From ‚Äúslicing his hand on a broken pitcher in his room‚Äù
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: I have no idea what the story is
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: Oo
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: Oh no
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: Ooooooh that does look nice
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: Is he alright?
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: I suppose so
10/3/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/3/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: On the bright side
10/3/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: My mom just texted me because he says his fingers are numb still so she asked if mine were like that after I cut them so I haven‚Äôt actually heard from him
10/3/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Maybe you'll have matching scars
10/3/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/3/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Oh that's not good
10/3/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Was it the front or back of his hand
10/3/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Palm-size or back*
10/3/19, 3:27 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/3/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: And also how close to fingers/wrist
10/3/19, 3:27 PM - Marianna: Mine were numb for a lot longer than I was comfortable with
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Still feel prickly when I touch the scars
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: He'll probably recover
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd assume
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: I mean I got 9 stitches
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm fine
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: And if not, it's really easy to work around nerve damage
10/3/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: And 3 without lidocaine I was not fine for that
10/3/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: Hey you get all worked up about these things I think you‚Äôre more concerned for him than I am
10/3/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm more interested in the story
10/3/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: Yeah I feel like this happens a lot
10/3/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: This is the kid that went to the ER like 8 times in 6 years
10/3/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Or maybe it was 6 times in 8 years
10/3/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: But still impressive
10/3/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: Geez Joey
10/3/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: He should get rewards points
10/3/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/3/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: Or a hospital punch card or something.
10/3/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: The staff was very concerned about his home life
10/3/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Partially because his stories of what happened were things like ‚ÄúI was doing a push up and my arms gave out so I split my eyebrow open on the foot of my bed‚Äù
10/3/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: (My mom thinks he was jumping on the bed)
10/3/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: And ‚ÄúI was running with bowls and that‚Äôs how I broke my nose‚Äù
10/3/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: I feel like he should be better at cover stories by now
10/3/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd give him points for creativity
10/3/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Oh and his friends in high school chased him down the stairs and he broke his arm and the hospital REALLY didn‚Äôt believe that one
10/3/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: They made everyone else leave because he was like 15
10/3/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/3/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: And asked him really what happened
10/3/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: He needs better excuses AND better friends
10/3/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Yeah I never liked his friends
10/3/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: They said I was lame
10/3/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: (I was lame)
10/3/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: (I am lame?)
10/3/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: (They‚Äôd probably say I am lame)
10/3/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: :(
10/3/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: Not lame
10/3/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: Cool
10/3/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: But also have I ever told you the story of how I got nerve damage in my left hand
10/3/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm very secure in who I am so I don‚Äôt care if people think I‚Äôm lame
10/3/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: Especially kids 2 years younger than me
10/3/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: Uh maybe?  I feel like we talked about this on the first date or soemthing
10/3/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
10/3/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: I think I did actually
10/3/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: Good memory
10/3/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: Also, I genuinely believe that you would be a cool older sibling
10/3/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: As the youngest of 3, I'm exercising my professional judgement here
10/3/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: A l s o
10/3/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Yes but Joey is not like you so he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cool
10/3/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Which is fine by me
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: I bought him aristocrat he may think I‚Äôm a tad bit cooler now
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: And AWWW
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: I miss your dogs
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Like I never met them
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm having to adjust to not getting photos every week
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: What, fine that I'm not like Joey? Yeah I think I'm really okay with that
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: This is good though
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: AWW
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: I'll do my best
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Yeah me to
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: I miss them too
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Please don‚Äôt be like Joey
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Ha
10/3/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah I don't think you need to worry about that
10/3/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: And hey hey hey
10/3/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Maybe you'll meet them next semester
10/3/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: I'm going to try to convince my parents to take them down
10/3/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: Do they travel well in the car?
10/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: No
10/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: But kinda
10/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Charlie gets anxious, but only when going to the dog sitters
10/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: And then he's fine once he's there
10/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Parker gets motion sick and has to get held
10/3/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: He has the cutest, saddest look on his face
10/3/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Also
10/3/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Should I pregame the flight?
10/3/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: (Just a little)
10/3/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Aw
10/3/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: We pamper dogs so much
10/3/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Or at least good people do
10/3/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: And well that‚Äôs up to you
10/3/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: I wasn‚Äôt gonna drink that much Friday night just like at the bar and maybe a glass of wine with dinners
10/3/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm not gonna deprive you of the experience!
10/3/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: And if you want to, I‚Äôd be willing to join you drinking
10/3/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: I'll join you then
10/3/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Also also also
10/3/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: And if you get it
10/3/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: Do you have any tips
10/3/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Oh sorry!
10/3/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I were at a thrift sho
10/3/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: Getting stuff that can get paint thrown on them
10/3/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm guessing carbonara?
10/3/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Yep!
10/3/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Everyone is a fan
10/3/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: I think I did okay
10/3/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Looks pretty okay to me
10/3/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Should have kept the bacon fat a lil hotter
10/3/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Oh, also, what did you get! I love thrift shopping
10/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Hey bacon fat anyway is good
10/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Well not cold
10/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: But any degree of warm is good
10/3/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: And grey pants and a sparkly top for tonight
10/3/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: And a button down so we can do risky business sometime maybe Halloween
10/3/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: Oh man
10/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: Risky business is a great look
10/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: Not even going to lie
10/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: And you better send pics of this party
10/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: I need to vicariously have at least _some_ fun tonight
10/3/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: (Okay cooking was fun but you know what I mean)
10/3/19, 8:22 PM - Marianna: I bet you would like risky business pictures üòâ
10/3/19, 8:22 PM - Marianna: Kidding I get that you mean about tonight
10/3/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: I'm sure you can guess but I'm still blushing
10/3/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: I need to do homework but im eating ice cream and drinking wine and watching Jane the virgin
10/3/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: Good job
10/3/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah, that sounds like the life
10/3/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: I'm debating how much of this midterm I want to do tonight
10/3/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: Takehome?
10/3/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: Or just studying?
10/3/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: Oh also whenever you want, we can chat for real quick about logistics and stuff
10/3/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Takehome
10/3/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: It's written and due tomorrow at midnight, so I'm probably going to submit it at your flat if that's fine with you
10/3/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: I just need to do it before I leave
10/3/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so exicted for you to be here!
10/3/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: But yes that is fine
10/3/19, 8:45 PM - Marianna: Although if you land at 10pm, we may not get back to my flat until like 11 or 11:30 just fair warning
10/3/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: Oh HEY

10/3/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna interrupt my singing but I suppose
10/3/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Ah okay
10/3/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: 10 minutes?
10/3/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd you don‚Äôt call in 5 I‚Äôll still be singing in 10
10/3/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a lose lose
10/3/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: But I give you permission to call so I won‚Äôt actually be mad how about that
10/3/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: Well it is a lose lose when the call drops every 2 seconds :(
10/3/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to make you go outside though because it‚Äôs cold
10/3/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Did you hang up or did it drop
10/3/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Oh for sure hung up
10/3/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just like that
10/3/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: ...

10/3/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: And now sad
10/3/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Man that was a roller coaster
10/3/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Like all 5 stages of loss
10/3/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: :(
10/3/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: No don‚Äôt go

10/3/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Well I can‚Äôt hear you over the sound of my beautiful and refined UI that is the sleekest of sleek
10/3/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Actually I miss seeing Linux screens

10/3/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Why are you gringle
10/3/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Don't worry about it
10/3/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Also, I sent a screenshot of this to my friend Woo, who I wish you met
10/3/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: He's the person who on the first day of class was like "wait what, you're like the second person I've ever met that also uses linux as a daily machine"
10/3/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: And he just replied "end her"
10/3/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: :(

10/3/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: It's okay
10/3/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: I'll forgive you as long as you apologize to mr. Cow eventually
10/3/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: And awwww, that's a shame
10/3/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Any reason?
10/3/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôm a friend of cows
10/3/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: More so than most
10/3/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: And robin didn‚Äôt get clothes to get paint on
10/3/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs far
10/3/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: And there‚Äôs a cover
10/3/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: So lots of reason
10/3/19, 10:47 PM - Caleb: Understandable
10/3/19, 10:47 PM - Caleb: So where are you going instead?
10/3/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know yet
10/3/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Maybe somewhere new

10/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: What a guy
10/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: I've got many, many stories
10/3/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Truthfully I'm not the biggest fan honestly
10/3/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I can tell you about it tomorrow if you want
10/3/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Or if you don't want me to ruin the magic of Kilian, I can do that too
10/3/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: Okay but like everyone else is a fan
10/3/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want the magic ruined
10/3/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: But also if he‚Äôs no good he‚Äôs no good
10/3/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/3/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: I wouldn't say no good
10/3/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Like he hasn't done anything absolutely horrible
10/3/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: He's a precious soul, but he's just done some really uncool things to a friend of mine because he's got the personality of a 7 year old
10/3/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: I'll spare you the details, don't worry
10/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Ohhh I‚Äôm sorry :(
10/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs not talk about kilian
10/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Or drew eastland
10/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Those are now off limits

10/3/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: To honestly all of those
10/3/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: But I think I know this girl and you‚Äôre hyped her up too much
10/3/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôll take it
10/3/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: But just like your ego, her ego doesn‚Äôt need it
10/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: (But just like she doesn‚Äôt neglect your ego and I guess it only fair)
10/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good
10/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Drunk
10/3/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm too much of a lightweight
10/3/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Ha
10/3/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah I can tell
10/3/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Usually when you call me "cutie" it's a dead giveaway
10/3/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Not that I'm complaining :))
10/3/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs my go to usually

10/4/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Not that that happens a lot at Davidson
10/4/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: Also- you had mentioned you wanted to do the baths here. If you still do, bring soemthing to wear in a pool or you can get swim trunks here or whatever
10/4/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: Forgot about that when talking about packing last night
10/4/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: I literally didn't bring a swimsuit
10/4/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: So I might need to get one

10/4/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Most of it was going over my head
10/4/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: And my friends are trying to meet up but anne basically requested we all go see her but the only way we could do that is if both Sarah and I skip class
10/4/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: So we‚Äôre kind of not happy
10/4/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: We wanted to go to Barcelona which would be easier to get too but Anne‚Äôs already gone and says she doesn‚Äôt want to spend money to go again
10/4/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: But whatever
10/4/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: Hey!  See ya in like 9 hours!
10/4/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: Also not to concern you but I‚Äôm eating fettuccine
10/4/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the rest of your day like?   How do you feel about the midterms?
10/4/19, 1:42 PM - Marianna: Update anne just called me a liar and was very rude from across Europe and I‚Äôm just very upset at mad at her and don‚Äôt want to go to Hungarian
10/4/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: Woah
10/4/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: That's a lot to handle
10/4/19, 2:15 PM - Caleb: Kinda uncool on Anne's part, I'm sorry you have to deal with that
10/4/19, 2:16 PM - Caleb: First off, she should be willing to travel and meet you in the middle
10/4/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: Second, she shouldn't demand that you sacrifice classes and travel, and she doesn't really do anything
10/4/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: Honestly that just sucks she's doing that to you guys, I'm sorry
10/4/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah I can tell you more later
10/4/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a tricky situation that I think I have to deal with now
10/4/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: How are you

10/4/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah space wasn't the issue
10/4/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: It was just my physical suitcase was too big

10/4/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: I basically brought my big one and then my weekend duffle

10/4/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: Ooooh

10/4/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Dont they
10/4/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Eh hate to break it to you but it‚Äôs more of a metro thing than a bus thing
10/4/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Although I have seen some impressive makeouts just waiting for you here
10/4/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Like however bad you‚Äôre imagining it, it‚Äôs worse I promise

10/6/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/7/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: If you want shopping today, west end mall is probably your best bet for efficiency because it‚Äôs huge. It‚Äôs off of nyugati p√°lyaudvar on the M3 which is at de√°k. You don‚Äôt need to do it today just an option. Also, some cool probably pretty bougie stores are on Andr√°ssy utca
10/7/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: Also I almost fell asleep on the escalators they seem like an eternity and I was so tired...
10/7/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/7/19, 8:28 AM - Marianna: Well darn

10/7/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: I'm too cozy
10/7/19, 8:29 AM - Caleb: Your bed is pretty nice, gotta say
10/7/19, 8:30 AM - Marianna: Oh also R√°k√≥czi they only speak hungarian probably you don‚Äôt want to do that one. We could go there for lunch Thursday if you‚Äôd want instead
10/7/19, 8:30 AM - Marianna: Mostly because I want to go too
10/7/19, 8:30 AM - Caleb: AHA
10/7/19, 8:30 AM - Caleb: The real reason
10/7/19, 8:30 AM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm v jealous of both you and the bed rn

10/7/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: Hey you‚Äôre welcome to try the market it was a fair warning and solution
10/7/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: And okay
10/7/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: It may be much later but I will
10/7/19, 8:32 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah, by the way, do you want to meet me out somewhere after class? Or should I just come back
10/7/19, 8:33 AM - Caleb: Also will your phone battery last
10/7/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: I have my battery pack
10/7/19, 8:33 AM - Marianna: But I will probably want to put my backpack down and go grocery shopping when I get home
10/7/19, 8:34 AM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt have to come back for that sarah can come with me

10/9/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah, but this place is just kinda eh so I think Budapest might be more fun
10/9/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: And sounds good! I'm not sure what I'll do Friday morning, but we can talk about that tonight
10/9/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: I'd love to go in with you though

10/9/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Like, can I get one of those then the extension and I'm good
10/9/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Because that's what I did and I'm worried that that's not the right thing to do
10/9/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Yes
10/9/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: Ok coolio
10/9/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Technically this morning you just never had the base...
10/9/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: But Sarah‚Äôs right we‚Äôve never been asked for our pass on the H√âV
10/9/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Shhhhhhhh don't rat on me

10/9/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: I can teach you crypto sometime
10/9/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: I was kind of bummed I did my crypto homework so fast yesterday because I kind of wanted to walk you though how I solve those things

10/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure I have anything to offer in return though
10/9/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Unless you want to learn a string instrument or something
10/9/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: Or bio or chem or something
10/9/19, 3:14 PM - Marianna: I like learning random things
10/9/19, 3:14 PM - Marianna: So just whatever knowledge I can get by association would be fine with me
10/9/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Well when we hang out on campus, im guessing there will be plenty of that üòÅ
10/9/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: I've got a few random hobbies in case you didn't catch that

10/9/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: Oh no
10/9/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: I smell fresh chimney cakes
10/9/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Resist
10/9/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: RESIST
10/9/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: but man you just made ME hungry
10/10/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/10/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: Oh nothing gets me like a good TI 84 C
10/10/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: Oh hey
10/10/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: Are you today date?
10/10/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: ...no?
10/10/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: Really I think you are
10/10/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: Because you‚Äôre 10/10
10/10/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Come on it‚Äôs the one day a year this works
10/10/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Well I guess you could do it in September but that‚Äôs a little cruel
10/10/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/10/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/11/19, 12:44 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/11/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: And whatever communication we do manage to do you‚Äôd best bet the Chinese government will be eavesdropping
10/11/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: Yeah in hindsight, I probably should have brought my other phone as a burner
10/11/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: I do have a VPN though, and I'm not totally sure but it might work
10/11/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: Hey
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: You
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: First off
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: Oh you're not asleep
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: Then first off
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: Go to bed
10/12/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: Second off, you gotta pick an album for next week
10/12/19, 3:58 AM - Marianna: Got home safely!  I wanted to let you know that this week has been abso-fucking-lutely incredible. I was so excited to plan things to show you all week and even though we didn‚Äôt necessarily stick to the timeline I literally had one of the best weeks in Budapest with ya. Glad I could be one of those obnoxious couples in the metro and public places for a few days. Sorry idk if you don‚Äôt like sappy things but yeah I‚Äôd like to thank you for visiting and being up for just getting on metro cars with me and walking around having no idea where we‚Äôre going. Second off, you seriously made me cry tonight with this postcard and the piglet drawing which is quite impressive (maybe take up art in addition to history as your 3rd major) but it‚Äôs okay because it‚Äôs a good cry and I‚Äôm gonna pass the fuck out soon don‚Äôt ya worry. Please have the time of your life in China, getting to practice some language, showing off your cool paper and cool brain, and whenever you get the chance, just shoot me some updates without causing you too much trouble. And relax, the hard part is done (aka like 100hr weeks) so now bask in the glory that penn literally likes you enough to send you to this conference. Not many people at all can say that. Anyway, I ~appreciated~ _really really really really liked_ having you here and we‚Äôll get in touch soon about the nov-dec weekend
10/12/19, 3:58 AM - Marianna: Sorry that was long
10/12/19, 3:59 AM - Marianna: Also what!  It‚Äôs your turn!  I picked this week!
10/12/19, 3:59 AM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs an album for you‚Ä¶ If You Leave by Daughter

10/12/19, 3:59 AM - Marianna: Idk i I ever sent it to you though so there it is
10/12/19, 3:59 AM - Marianna: Okay sleep time for me and piglet. Be safe and see you in not too long!
10/12/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: Well
10/12/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: I had a whole flight how to think of how to respond to that
10/12/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: But I couldn't
10/12/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: Partially because I passed out the second I sat down and woke up when we landed
10/12/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/12/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/12/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: I did get a Hungarian sunrise and random river though
10/12/19, 8:25 AM - Caleb: BUT
10/12/19, 8:25 AM - Caleb: hallo aus frankfurt :)
10/12/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: (Also, for the record, I love sappy things.)
10/12/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: But thank you again for having me
10/12/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: I really can't think of a more fun vacation than that
10/12/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: Also
10/12/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZHln0m59fpobHTYMc6Qs4?si=u_MBUWH2TxOcUNAss7CW_w
10/12/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: I'm leaning on this being the album
10/12/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: Not totally totally decided though
10/12/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: A l s o (part 3)
10/12/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/12/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/12/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: Should I... should I tell him?
10/12/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Yay I‚Äôm glad you saw the pretty sunrise!  And that you got sleep!
10/12/19, 10:12 AM - Marianna: I just submitted the homework and an extra credit one so it‚Äôs back to bed for me but they are making quite the ruckus outside with taking the stage down
10/12/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: And uuuuuuh spyros?  I mean he surely must know it‚Äôs a wonky face but maybe it‚Äôs supposed to display excitement like woah look what we‚Äôre doing today
10/12/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: Also I found one of your shirts between my wall and my bed so sorry you‚Äôll have to come back but it‚Äôs also nice to have because it smells like you
10/12/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: ;)
10/12/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: (Kidding with the winky face it was for comedic effect)
10/12/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: CONGRATS on submitting
10/12/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: Get that sleep
10/12/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: You've earned it
10/12/19, 10:16 AM - Caleb: And re spyros: no I'm sure the only explanation is that he's my sidehoe
10/12/19, 10:16 AM - Caleb: Sorry about that
10/12/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs okay
10/12/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: He seems cool
10/12/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: But his wife might not love it don‚Äôt homewreck caleb just don‚Äôt
10/12/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: Oh and darn about the shirt
10/12/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: I mean
10/12/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: If you _want_ to hang onto it, I wouldn't mind üòÅ
10/12/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: I also guess I don't have a conception of what I smell like
10/12/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: Is that weird? Maybe
10/12/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: Oh, what shirt was it?
10/12/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: Well it does seem like the most reasonable option for me to just keep it for you because I wasn‚Äôt exactly planning on coming to China this week
10/12/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: And you know me I love smells and people smells like of people in my life are so comforting
10/12/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs just the plain black one?
10/12/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: Im assuming it‚Äôs yours because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs mine and it does smell like you
10/12/19, 10:31 AM - Caleb: Ha, very fair
10/12/19, 10:31 AM - Caleb: I'm the same way, but I dont think I've ever had someone's shirt before
10/12/19, 10:32 AM - Caleb: But I've told you about how if my mom ever ships clothes to Davidson, I REALLY dont want to wear it because the smell reminds me of my mom
10/12/19, 10:39 AM - Marianna: I wasn‚Äôt gonna ask for you to leave one because that seems a tad extra and it‚Äôs not like anyone brought like EXTRA clothes to abroad so I‚Äôd feel bad but I‚Äôm glad you did
10/12/19, 10:39 AM - Marianna: And aww
10/12/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just gonna find you at the union post office with your head in a box of clean clothes sent from home
10/12/19, 10:40 AM - Marianna: Okay I have to put my phone away so I can sleep catch ya later alligator
10/12/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: Hey sounds like you lucked out then :)
10/12/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: Anyway, in a while crocodile
10/12/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: I'll try to let you know when I'm in China
10/12/19, 10:43 AM - Caleb: I'll figure something out
10/12/19, 10:43 AM - Caleb: I promise
10/12/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Update: already had first chinese convo
10/12/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Went well
10/12/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Stuttered a little but I still got it
10/12/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Well
10/12/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Taking off
10/12/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you laaaater? Probably not today
10/12/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Have a good rest of your day! Get lots of sleep, have some fun, and goodnight!
10/12/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Send updates and I'll try to see if I can figure things out when I land
10/12/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Oh holy shit I haven't even taken off and it feels mildly totalitarian
10/12/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: The airplane announcements start with, "in accordance with the laws and regulations of the peoples republic of China, you are subject to detention, imprisonment, and fines if...."
10/12/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: And lists a ton of stuff
10/12/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/12/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Leaving now
10/12/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Bye
10/12/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Cya
10/12/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: üëçüëç
10/12/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Testing
10/13/19, 1:50 AM - Marianna: I read you but don‚Äôt get in trouble can we email instead?  Did you get my email?
10/13/19, 1:52 AM - Caleb: I mean if you want to that's totally fine
10/13/19, 1:52 AM - Caleb: But it's actually all good
10/13/19, 1:54 AM - Caleb: The hotel wifi allows it for some reasonn
10/13/19, 1:54 AM - Caleb: I'm not even using a vpn
10/13/19, 1:55 AM - Caleb: If I'm using Chinese cellular it doesn't work though
10/13/19, 1:55 AM - Marianna: Ohhhh
10/13/19, 1:56 AM - Marianna: Okay I suppose that‚Äôs okay but we generate a lot of messages using scale but it might be a big blip of traffic idk how or if theyd see it though
10/13/19, 1:57 AM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs more conspicuous to be texting because it‚Äôs not like they really allow any texting apps
10/13/19, 1:57 AM - Marianna: But just be careful
10/13/19, 1:57 AM - Marianna: How are you!  How‚Äôs China!
10/13/19, 1:58 AM - Marianna: Wait maybe don‚Äôt answer the second question or just tell me the good things
10/13/19, 1:59 AM - Caleb: Ha
10/13/19, 1:59 AM - Caleb: It's been great
10/13/19, 1:59 AM - Caleb: It was a whirlwind of a morning
10/13/19, 2:00 AM - Caleb: I'll have to tell you about it on the phone if I get a chance
10/13/19, 2:01 AM - Caleb: But it involves TONS of frantic communication
10/13/19, 2:01 AM - Caleb: Lots of on-the-fly decision making
10/13/19, 2:01 AM - Caleb: A very talkative woman sitting next to me on the plane
10/13/19, 2:01 AM - Caleb: The last time I slept, it was at your place
10/13/19, 2:01 AM - Caleb: So that's how I'm doing
10/13/19, 2:01 AM - Caleb: Oh and showered too
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Marianna: Ooh sounds exciting but also draining
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Marianna: Are you gonna get to sleep today?
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: Lemme tell ya
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like 8am there right?
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: I was like "this place is awful why am I here" for the first three hours
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Caleb: But the conference is actually pretty awesome
10/13/19, 2:02 AM - Marianna: But how the heck did you not sleep for like the 15 hr flight or whatever it was?
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: So that turned it around
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: Yay!
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: .... She was VERY talkative
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: Like
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: I straight up would have been like hi lady shut the fuck up
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: Also
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: I'd said "okay I need to sleep, I'm very tired"
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: And she LITERALLY POKED ME AND KEPT TALKIN
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: WHAT
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: Was she american?
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: I HAD HEADPHONES IN
10/13/19, 2:03 AM - Caleb: No she was Chinese
10/13/19, 2:04 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôve never heard anything so rude
10/13/19, 2:04 AM - Caleb: She didn't say a word until I ordered tea in Chinese
10/13/19, 2:04 AM - Caleb: And then was so excited that this pasty white dude spoke Chinese
10/13/19, 2:04 AM - Caleb: And then somehow I got her full life story
10/13/19, 2:04 AM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs kind of cool
10/13/19, 2:04 AM - Marianna: Man don‚Äôt you wish you‚Äôd opted for english now
10/13/19, 2:05 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm mad for you
10/13/19, 2:08 AM - Caleb: Honestly
10/13/19, 2:08 AM - Caleb: A little
10/13/19, 2:08 AM - Caleb: I'm doing okay though
10/13/19, 2:08 AM - Caleb: Daylight does insane things for me
10/13/19, 2:08 AM - Caleb: Like, I've gotten _maybe_ 4 hours of sleep in the last 3 days
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Caleb: As you know
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Caleb: But I'm. Just. Crusin.
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Marianna: Sorry :(
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Marianna: Just keep crusin
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Caleb: Also
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Marianna: Do you have any obligations today other than just see the conference?
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Caleb: This hotel is absolutely stunning
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Marianna: Where the conference is?
10/13/19, 2:09 AM - Caleb: Nope! That and try to maybe think about homework
10/13/19, 2:10 AM - Caleb: Well I can't Google it, but look up "Intercontinental shenzhen"
10/13/19, 2:11 AM - Marianna: Oh boo try to think about homework
10/13/19, 2:11 AM - Caleb: China is wild though
10/13/19, 2:11 AM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt get any done yesterday and am going to Bratislava today so won‚Äôt do any today soooo
10/13/19, 2:11 AM - Caleb: I'll tell you about it sometime when I get back and have free time
10/13/19, 2:12 AM - Caleb: How are you!
10/13/19, 2:12 AM - Marianna: Hey remember üëÇüëÇüëÇ
10/13/19, 2:12 AM - Marianna: And good
10/13/19, 2:12 AM - Marianna: Went to bed at 11 ish I just woke up though
10/13/19, 2:13 AM - Marianna: My friends and I were gonna hang out but Devansh said he was too tired and I low key fell asleep while josh and Robin were doing homework in my kitchen so we called it a night
10/13/19, 2:13 AM - Marianna: And now the bma kids are trying to get me to rally and come out because they‚Äôve been in line at instant for 2 hours
10/13/19, 2:14 AM - Marianna: Which I pointed out was not going to help them convince me to rally rn
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Marianna: But we went back to the chimney cake festival and waiting in line for 2 hours!! But admittedly that chimney cake today was better than yesterday sorry you‚Äôll have to come abck
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: Ah
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: Rats
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Marianna: And there are currently people literally hollering outside my windows
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: Guess I'll have to then
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: Thars fun though!
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: O
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: Oh no
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Caleb: Not the hollering thing
10/13/19, 2:15 AM - Marianna: Also low key the ones in the metro are better I think because they are less hyped up
10/13/19, 2:16 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/13/19, 2:16 AM - Caleb: That's how it goes sometimes
10/13/19, 2:17 AM - Caleb: It's alright though
10/13/19, 2:17 AM - Caleb: It was still super fun to just go and have that experience
10/13/19, 2:17 AM - Marianna: Yeah!
10/13/19, 2:17 AM - Marianna: Oh also the castle we saw‚Äîrobin told me the history of it
10/13/19, 2:19 AM - Marianna: It (and heroes square I‚Äôm pretty sure) were built to commemorate 1000 years of Hungarian history and the castle was build out of cardboard and wood because it was supposed to be a temporary display but the people loved it so much they made it an actual thing which is why the architecture is so wild inside like did you notice that there was no one style?  Each part seemed to have a different look because it was designed by a different person or for a different reason
10/13/19, 2:20 AM - Marianna: I might have butchered that but I‚Äôm not ready to give up my tourguiding days
10/13/19, 2:21 AM - Marianna: Okay I want to keep talking but I think I need to get back to sleep so goodnight!
10/13/19, 2:22 AM - Marianna: And wait is there like a boat and a beach in the hotel?  Is that was google images is showing me?
10/13/19, 3:50 AM - Caleb: Damn
10/13/19, 3:50 AM - Caleb: I really want to be back in Budapest right now
10/13/19, 3:50 AM - Caleb: :(
10/13/19, 3:51 AM - Caleb: And idk
10/13/19, 3:52 AM - Caleb: I'm staying at an eh AirBnB nearby
10/13/19, 3:53 AM - Caleb: But it's a really really fancy hotel that the actual conference is at
10/13/19, 5:07 AM - Caleb: Hey I'm having a lot of trouble sending things in general right now
10/13/19, 5:07 AM - Caleb: Snap chat, what's app, and even email
10/13/19, 5:07 AM - Caleb: Nothing seems like it's going through
10/13/19, 5:07 AM - Caleb: And my VPN isn't working
10/13/19, 5:07 AM - Caleb: Right now I'm thinking maybe it's just bad wifi
10/13/19, 5:07 AM - Caleb: But idk
10/13/19, 6:46 AM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt you been to the hotel though?  Did you see the boat and the beaches?
10/13/19, 6:47 AM - Marianna: And I got those later messages around 11:08 you‚Äôre time if that tells you what made them send
10/13/19, 6:47 AM - Marianna: And good morning from me!  Time to get up and get ready for Bratislava
10/13/19, 6:51 AM - Caleb: Oh hey good morning
10/13/19, 6:52 AM - Caleb: Have a fun day! I hope Bratislava super fun
10/13/19, 6:52 AM - Caleb: It's just you and Robin right?
10/13/19, 6:52 AM - Caleb: And yeah, I have been there, but it's actually pretty massive so idk
10/13/19, 6:52 AM - Caleb: I'd totally believe it
10/13/19, 6:52 AM - Caleb: Maybe tomorrow I'll take veev for the day
10/13/19, 6:53 AM - Caleb: Also there are just so many peculiar things about this place
10/13/19, 6:54 AM - Caleb: I should write them all down so I can tell you next time we tally
10/13/19, 6:54 AM - Caleb: Talk*
10/13/19, 7:04 AM - Caleb: OH by the way, for some reason I can receive snapchats but not send them
10/13/19, 7:04 AM - Caleb: So idk if that keeps a streak but I guess we'll see
10/13/19, 7:04 AM - Caleb: Remind me to tell you the saga of how I tried to pass my snapchat to Calvin
10/13/19, 6:58 AM - Marianna: Yup!
10/13/19, 6:58 AM - Marianna: And yeah it looked massive online
10/13/19, 6:59 AM - Marianna: Is it more of a symposium or a list of events that you go to different rooms for?
10/13/19, 6:59 AM - Marianna: Are you done for the day?  Did you get sleep?
10/13/19, 6:59 AM - Marianna: Sorry lots of questions
10/13/19, 6:59 AM - Marianna: And okay!  Sounds good for me!
10/13/19, 7:33 AM - Caleb: It's like a giant thing of scheduling conflicts for a week straight
10/13/19, 7:33 AM - Caleb: A lot of it is these really cool workshops but all at the same time
10/13/19, 7:34 AM - Caleb: So it's different rooms for different things
10/13/19, 7:35 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll keep sending them then!
10/13/19, 7:36 AM - Marianna: And what you‚Äôre saying I could have almost gotten to speak with Calvino for a whole week and you didn‚Äôt make that happen?!
10/13/19, 7:37 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs cool though!  And usually how things like that go
10/13/19, 7:37 AM - Marianna: Like classes
10/13/19, 7:37 AM - Marianna: ü§Ø
10/13/19, 7:37 AM - Marianna: And do you do your presentation everyday or is there a day when everyone does them?
10/13/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: I do mine on Thursday at 2:30 my time
10/13/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: And gotta say
10/13/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: A lil nervous
10/13/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: A lot nervous
10/13/19, 7:49 AM - Caleb: It only needs to be 10 minutes
10/13/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: But like ahhhhhh high pressure
10/13/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: Oh shit I'm right after an invited speaker too
10/13/19, 8:06 AM - Marianna: Ah hey kid guess what
10/13/19, 8:06 AM - Marianna: You got this!
10/13/19, 8:07 AM - Marianna: Remember the whole kick-ass research-project-for-an-ivy-when-you‚Äôre-a-sophomore-from-a-small-liberal-arts-College-that-you-worked-super-hard-on thing?
10/13/19, 8:10 AM - Marianna: On the bus for Bratislava!  It‚Äôs a really nice bus and robin and I have the top deck front seats it‚Äôs fun
10/13/19, 8:12 AM - Marianna: Jk we don‚Äôt have those seats someone reserved them so we had to move :(
10/13/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: Hey
10/13/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: You
10/13/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: Thanks :)
10/13/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: And Marianna. I fucking did it.
10/13/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: I can't believe it
10/13/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: I used my middle school knowledge to break the Great Firewall and use Google
10/13/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: I'll tell you how when I get back
10/13/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: It's the funniest thing I've ever seen
10/13/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: Hey hey you you
10/13/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like you‚Äôre girlfriend
10/13/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Because she supports you and does her job of reminding you that‚Äôs you‚Äôre pretty gosh darn coolio
10/13/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: And um how?
10/13/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Do I want to know?
10/13/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Actually I do think i want to know
10/13/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: But also remember don‚Äôt get arrested that‚Äôd be a dealbreaker
10/13/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: But yeah you can tell me later
10/13/19, 9:27 AM - Caleb: Oh well that's just disappointing
10/13/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: I really like her though so eh I can live with that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/13/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: I'd be cooler if ya did though üòé
10/13/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Also
10/13/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: The funny part about the workaround is that it does in fact involve Coolio
10/13/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Also
10/13/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: (part 2)
10/13/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: I've accomplished my other goal in life
10/13/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: I annoyed a medical software engineer by getting excited about this one idea I had to build off of it
10/13/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: ... Or maybe he was annoyed because he knew I didn't have $3000 to drop on it
10/13/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: Oooooh well
10/13/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: Brokeboi over here
10/13/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll consider liking her
10/13/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: Oh?  Are you looking at other people‚Äôs stuff and projects and research rn?
10/13/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: We have gotten to gyor in Hungary and just have a little longer until Bratislava
10/13/19, 10:01 AM - Marianna: Or as the Hungarians call it, pozsony. It used to be a Hungarian city but they lost the land but refuse to call it by the Slovakian name so I‚Äôm gonna stand with Hungary on this one and call it pozsony
10/13/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Oh right isn't this what you and your Hungarian teacher were talking about
10/13/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: Yeah!
10/13/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: And she went "nem, Pozsony" and you were like "igen, Pozsony"
10/13/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: And then blamed me for the bad weather
10/13/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: And kinda? There are posters up, but also like industry booths and I was talking with this guy from Canada about it
10/13/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Oh also with the whole snapchat not being able to send photos thing. Did you get the photo I sent in this chat yesterday?  The fika one?  I‚Äôm thinking maybe they don‚Äôt allow photos out or in at all
10/13/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: And can you see my snap videos and photos or no?
10/13/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: Oh yes I do blame you for the poor weather no offense
10/13/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: Although I‚Äôd give up 70 degrees to hang with you
10/13/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: Also, I got rejected from a student membership for MICCAI because he asked if I was a student, and I was like "yeah!" and he was like "oh so where are you doing your grad work" and I was like "well actually"
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: So that's how I, as a junior in college, got rejected from a student membership (and they also apparently do music for the events so I'm kinda bummed)
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: ANYWAY
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Yes, yes I did get your snapchats
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Definitely the video
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Because "go Byrds"
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Oh but not the ones in this chat
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: It's only text that works for what's app for some reason
10/13/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: Idk why, probably something with the data transmission protocol or something
10/13/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: But what did you send?
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: And oh that‚Äôs cool. I can kind of see why he would be annoyed you were talking and not buying anything
10/13/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: No no I sent more today
10/13/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: And interestingly enough all of them even the ones yesterday say they haven‚Äôt been opened by you
10/13/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: Not that I care if you don‚Äôt open them
10/13/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just interesting see what works and what doesn‚Äôt
10/13/19, 10:08 AM - Marianna: Davidson has a fika club type thing!  They have an insta page where you can fill out a survey each month and they match you with a new person they don‚Äôt think you know for a coffee friend date!
10/13/19, 10:08 AM - Marianna: Not that it affects us until we get back but I thought you‚Äôd like to know you can go to fika at davidson
10/13/19, 10:08 AM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt that what you went to in Sweden with Ana and Olaf?
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: Oh that sounds absolutely delightful~~~
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: And idk if it will last until the spring because everytime someone tries to set something like this up it doesn‚Äôt seem to work for long
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: If there's an email list or something can you sign me up
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: Oh
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: Aw
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Caleb: :(
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a monthly thi Nd
10/13/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: Thing*
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: And yeah! It is, I did it with their church after helping do yard work
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Marianna: Like they have an October survey to set people up for the next month I think
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: What a fun weekend
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Oh
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Yeah probably don't sign me up for that
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Unless they want to come visit
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: Which might be a little odd
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: I mean who just goes and visits someone they barely know gosh
10/13/19, 10:10 AM - Marianna: Well I can at least send you the Instagram when you get back to Copenhagen because they requested to follow me. They may also request to follow you
10/13/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: Davidson instas have a proclivity for finding people on insta
10/13/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: It could mean anything when people do that!
10/13/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt believe you thought you wouldn‚Äôt see me again after philly
10/13/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: I ain‚Äôt that kind of gal buddy
10/13/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: I mean
10/13/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: It was like a really disappointing, melancholy feeling
10/13/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: And not like a "I think this is going to happen"
10/13/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: More "what if this happens"
10/13/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: I promise don't take it in the wrong way
10/13/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: I obviously wanted to see you again
10/13/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: And ooooh were these on Instagram?
10/13/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: Instagram is owned by Facebook
10/13/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: Oh well I‚Äôm sorry
10/13/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm still here!
10/13/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: This would be where I‚Äôd send a studid closeup selfie of my smiling
10/13/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: But you‚Äôre gonna have to deal with this instead:
10/13/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: :)
10/13/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: Yeah I wasn‚Äôt really taking it the wrong way I just hoped it wasn‚Äôt anything I did to make you even think it was possible
10/13/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: Not that it matters because we‚Äôre still talking with a firewall between us
10/13/19, 10:15 AM - Marianna: And well I sent a screenshot of the account not an actual link
10/13/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: But yeah I absolutely hate that Facebook owns Instagram I don‚Äôt want a Facebook because Facebook is evil but I really like Instagram
10/13/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: I know you sent this jokingly but also I can 100% see your silly face from it
10/13/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Also
10/13/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: They're about to have a cocktail party for us
10/13/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: In a 5 star hotel
10/13/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: This is the life, gotta say
10/13/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Hate traveling but fun being here
10/13/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: Ooooooooh please drink so many cute little cocktails
10/13/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: Good cocktails make me so happy
10/13/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: I really want to learn to be a bartender
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: Hey
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: You
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: Can
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: Hey I'll even let you use me as practice
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: I'd happily be your guinnea pig
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: So far no cute little cocktails
10/13/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: But it's early in the party
10/13/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: And hello from Slovakia!
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Dear mr rlo, I happen to know for a fact that one of your highly praised hall counselors has just volunteered to help an underage student make cocktails, maybe even buy the alcohol for the cocktails. I thought youd like to know
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: :o
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Oh what kind of cocktail party doesn‚Äôt have cocktails
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: Well actually I‚Äôve been to a few
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: you
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: But I hope you get there
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: meanie
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Pardon my French
10/13/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Ratting me out to Toddy S like that
10/13/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Hey
10/13/19, 11:22 AM - Marianna: You did it first
10/13/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: Nuh

10/13/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Have fun in Bratislava! If you send pictures I guess I might get them eventually
10/13/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Or snapchat
10/13/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: But anyway HAVE FUUUUUN
10/13/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Hey I'm tipsy and sappy but has anyone told you that you smile with your eyes and it's absolutely precious
10/13/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll just keep the pictures and dump them on ya when you get back
10/13/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Awwww you too good
10/13/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: No one has told me that but okay I suppose I believe you
10/13/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Robin and I are at a coffee shop
10/13/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: We decided not to do mimosas considering we both haven‚Äôt eaten like anything
10/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Making good Sunday decisions out here
10/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: And yes
10/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: It's true
10/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Deal with it
10/13/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: That's as sappy as I'm getting tonight
10/13/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: ... Probably
10/13/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Only the best decisions on a Sunday
10/13/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: We decided we‚Äôd do drinks with dinner soo
10/13/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôll allow that
10/13/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the party been?  Is it just researchers?  Mostly old phds or grad students?
10/13/19, 12:11 PM - Marianna: Update we got gingerbread lattes and wow
10/13/19, 12:16 PM - Marianna: And have you ever had shakshuka?
10/13/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Oh it was a lot of people
10/13/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Very fun
10/13/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: I'm in another talk though
10/13/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna bail early and hit the sack though
10/13/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: And offered Spyros my seat
10/13/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: And nope, can't say I have
10/13/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: I support hitting the sack
10/13/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: And offering spyros your seat
10/13/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: What a gentleman
10/13/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôd like it maybe
10/13/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/13/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: Guess
10/13/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: What
10/13/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/13/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: We have coffee, cake, and coffee cake :)))
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: Hey I got a photo!!
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: I was gonna guess chicken butt
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Ah
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: But oh man those cakes look good
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's a good backup
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: Although no matter how often I guess chicken butt that has never been someone‚Äôs answer
10/13/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: My plan was to see how many I could eat before they threw me out
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: Statistically it should have come up by now
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: Don't worry I'll lay it on ya sometime
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: Well statistics are DUMB
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll have to investigate later
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: Do some probability
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: What's the probability I pass out within the next 20 minutes
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: Thats a good one
10/13/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: Ezpz one
10/13/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs been 26 minutes since you sent that so I hope you‚Äôre asleep
10/13/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm in the Bratislava castle looking at art
10/13/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: Oh darn
10/13/19, 2:07 PM - Caleb: This is awkward now
10/13/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: Darn
10/13/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: One of us is bad at math
10/13/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: Or maybe the math kept you awake
10/13/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: It sometimes does that for me
10/13/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: So stop thinking about math!
10/13/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: THE NUMBERS MARIANNA
10/13/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: WHAT DO THEY MEAN
10/13/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: Nah I'm just hanging out and talking with Siddhesh
10/13/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: Oh!  How is seeing siddhesh again!
10/13/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: And is he there on the same paper as you or did he submit his own thing to the conference?
10/13/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: It's good seeing him again
10/13/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Hes kinda stressed and unhappy
10/13/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: (mostly because he lives a super unhealthy lifestyle)
10/13/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: But I was just trying to convince him to try new things, and whenever he sees something ask if he would want to try it
10/13/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: Also
10/13/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: Hey you, you should fire up that class Linux distro and install cowsay sometime
10/13/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: Oh no poor siddhesh
10/13/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: How long is he in India?  And what‚Äôs he doing while he‚Äôs there?
10/13/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: And okay maybe
10/13/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: I may put it on my other Linux machine though like the one I got through davidson comp org
10/13/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: Until next summer I think
10/13/19, 3:20 PM - Caleb: He graduated recently and is gonna work at Penn for a bit
10/13/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: And nooope, gotta do it on the Comp Bio one too
10/13/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: Sorry 'boot that
10/13/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Okay, Ima sleep now
10/13/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you tomorrow! Have fun in Bratislava!
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: Okay but I probably won‚Äôt use that one ever again
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: But I will
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: If I figure out how to
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: Linux commands aren‚Äôt my forte
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: And yeah sleep
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs late
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre gonna keep walking get dinner and then head back
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm getting tired too
10/13/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
10/13/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: ("sudo apt-get install cowsay") should do it
10/13/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: Anyway
10/13/19, 4:26 PM - Caleb: Áù°ËßâÁù°ÁöÑÂ•Ω! ÊòéÂ§©ËßÅ!

I‚Äôm pretty tired and we just ate so much food including the National Slovakian dish and beer made in the restaurant we just ate at (and double shots that we didn‚Äôt realize we were ordering)
10/13/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Home!
10/14/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Okay sorry to bombard you hours apart with texts but I‚Äôm going to sleep so goodnight part 2 and I‚Äôm gonna listen to the album you sent. I‚Äôve def heard some of these songs before idk if you‚Äôd have sent them or I found them some other way but I‚Äôm a fan
10/14/19, 1:05 AM - Caleb: Yeah sorry to break it to you but im not sure if that counts as bombarding me with texts
10/14/19, 1:05 AM - Caleb: Either that or I didn't a lot of texts
10/14/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: Anyway, I'm glad you had a fun day! I can't wait to get the pictures and see what you did
10/14/19, 1:07 AM - Caleb: That sounds like such a fun time
10/14/19, 4:34 AM - Caleb: Man, it's exceedingly hard having a Google phone in China
10/14/19, 7:01 AM - Marianna: Good morning
10/14/19, 7:01 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm tired
10/14/19, 7:01 AM - Marianna: And yeah I suppose that wasn‚Äôt that many I think I was just hoping your phone doesn‚Äôt wake you up
10/14/19, 7:02 AM - Marianna: And oh yeah do built ins not work well? What does everyone have when you look around?  Is it all huewei or apple or what?
10/14/19, 7:56 AM - Caleb: Gooood morning :)
10/14/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: And don't worry about it, 99% of the time my phone is muted
10/14/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: And on Do not disturb
10/14/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: But yeah tons of built ins are broken, and pretty much everything is Huawei and Apple
10/14/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: How are you! What do you have today?
10/14/19, 7:58 AM - Marianna: And wait do you want the photos now or just wait until later?
10/14/19, 8:15 AM - Caleb: A lot of chats and pictures are dropping so just hold off until I get back if that's fine with you
10/14/19, 8:16 AM - Caleb: Internet here is still a headache, sorry
10/14/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: Good good I figured most of our generation does that
10/14/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: (Molly did not and had hers on _volume_ which was another thing that was just so inconsiderate)
10/14/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: And oof must be super great to not have a working phone
10/14/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: Yeah like do you have anything on there for directions BESIDES google maps?
10/14/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: That would make me so unhappy and nervous to go outside if I knew I couldn‚Äôt look at maps again
10/14/19, 8:19 AM - Caleb: I'll be honest, no I don't
10/14/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: I used a VPN to download it for offline use though
10/14/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Which I hope works
10/14/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Because if I get in trouble, I can't Google anything either
10/14/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: It's weird to be so resourceless
10/14/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: I feel kinda helpless until I remember that I'm actually a fairly capable person
10/14/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: So it's more of just an adjustment
10/14/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: I just wish things were consistent from one day to another though
10/14/19, 8:21 AM - Marianna: And okay that‚Äôs fine with me!  I haven‚Äôt even gotten them to my phone yet
10/14/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: Yeah I was thinking
10/14/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: How do Chinese students do research projects?  Is there a Chinese equivalent of google?
10/14/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: Maybe we as a western society rely too much on google though
10/14/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: And yeah remember you also speak Chinese which is more than most could say at that conference maybe
10/14/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: You know, I'm not sure how Chinese students do research
10/14/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: I'd imagine research universities have special internet access
10/14/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: But also, having control over information in research sounds on brand
10/14/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: And oh yeah we definitely do rely on Google too much, but at the same time our world has evolved to expect us to
10/14/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: Oh also, to give you an idea of how fancy-schmancy this place is:
10/14/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: There's a dedicated guy in the bathroom wearing a uniform
10/14/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: His sole job is to spray and quickly clean the urinal after you pee
10/14/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: Sorry if that's tmi
10/14/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: It's just nuts
10/14/19, 8:47 AM - Marianna: Interesting
10/14/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: I feel like I really did not realize how different society was there
10/14/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm not even there
10/14/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: So maybe I‚Äôm just thinking it‚Äôs more different
10/14/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs fascinating
10/14/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll become a sociology major
10/14/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: I think this is what they do
10/14/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs interesting also that maccai was allowed to bring in a bunch of western scientists and projects too
10/14/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: Everything‚Äôs just interesting
10/14/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/14/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: Trust me I'll have lots to talk about when I get back
10/14/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: Oh also update: he also cleans water that splashes out of the sink on the counter tops
10/14/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: OH AND THE SINKS ARE SO COOL
10/14/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: That is beyond strange
10/14/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: I feel bad for him
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: I hope he gets paid well
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just like living in the lap of luxury for a week
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: OH
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: HOW
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: HAS
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: THE
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: FOOD
10/14/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: BEEN
10/14/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: Food? I'll tell you in an hour
10/14/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: I haven't eaten out yet
10/14/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
10/14/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: HELLLOOOOOOOO
10/14/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Uh Caleb then what have you been eating
10/14/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: Oh!  We learned about shingles in comp bio today
10/14/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: Pretty cool stuff
10/14/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: Oh nothing is delivering
10/14/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: HOW
10/14/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: ARE
10/14/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: YOU
10/14/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: YOU LOVELY LOVELY GAL
10/14/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Sorry went out for dinner and drinks with my department
10/14/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Super fun
10/14/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: But now I'm over the top
10/14/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: And I know you're in class until 6
10/14/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: And I proooobably will be asleep by then
10/14/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: But I just want you to know that you're absolutely spectacular, and I keep looking through photos of the last week and smiling like an idiot
10/14/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: So ya
10/14/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: Ha
10/14/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: Deal with it
10/14/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: I think you're great and I just want to hug you a lot
10/14/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: And I can't wait to see you soonish
10/14/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: I'm so so so _so_ glad I was wrong about thinking I wouldn't see you again after Philly
10/14/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: Wait a second NO YOU HAVE A BREAK AT 5
10/14/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: If I'm not asleep in 20 minutes this is gonna be embarrassing
10/14/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: But I'll do it anyway because I want to talk with you, even for like 5 minutes
10/14/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: So I'll brief you know: we went down some alleys and got dinner at a Chinese dive bar
10/14/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: And. Oh. My. Gosh.
10/14/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: What an experience
10/14/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Ah but on Monday‚Äôs I get out at 4 pm so I just got home
10/14/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: And my thoughts upon reading those texts was:
10/14/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: 1. Well at least he‚Äôs alive...
10/14/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: 2. And probably been drinking
10/14/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: 3. Oh definitely been drinking
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: And then you said you had been so it lost the fun
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: But me too about the photos
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: :)))
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: But also I still need the photos of us places we have people take on your phone!
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: They can wait though
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: But it sounds like you‚Äôve had quite the night
10/14/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: Our walk home was slightly scarring
10/14/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: Oh?
10/14/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I had to walk past a guy very loudly masterbating by the sidewalk near the train station and just kind of had to hurry along
10/14/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Not super comfortable
10/14/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: People are crazy man

10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/14/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Remember this was like 4pm in a wide open park
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: You're too cute for the firewall anyway
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: And that's not going to make sense until a bit later
10/14/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Crazy stuff
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: But we‚Äôre good now
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: Home safe
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: I have a yogurt
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Uh
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Unhygge
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: :(
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: And am doing laundry
10/14/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm gonna have to call anne in like an hour
10/14/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: You deleted this message
10/14/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: Which means all the texts get sent after the pics
10/14/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: Wellll sheeeewwwt
10/14/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: Oh well
10/14/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: Backlog of texts
10/14/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: Why are you calling Anne? Are there any updates between you two?
10/14/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: Very unhygienic
10/14/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: I meant unhygge
10/14/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: But that too
10/14/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Yes on all fronts
10/14/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: I'm really sorry
10/14/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: I really don't understand why some people do some things
10/14/19, 4:51 PM - Caleb: And I'm sorry you had to deal with that
10/14/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: And okay if my alleged cuteness can beat out that firewall I‚Äôm fine with it maybe
10/14/19, 4:53 PM - Caleb: Well
10/14/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Currently none are sending, so sorry but my Mr. Xi may be the stronger one here
10/14/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: WAIT NO THEY DID
10/14/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: HA
10/14/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Deal with it you kind, benevolent leader
10/14/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: They did!  Thank you!
10/14/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: And she said we could push off her wanting to ‚Äútalk about it‚Äù from last week because I said you were here and didn‚Äôt want to spend my time talking on the phone
10/14/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: So today‚Äôs the day we‚Äôll see what she‚Äôs mad at
10/14/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Or maybe she‚Äôll call to apologize
10/14/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Do you think she's mellowed since then?
10/14/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Is she the type of person to do that?
10/14/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: No she‚Äôll hold a grudge until she dies
10/14/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: I don't want to sound crass
10/14/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: But do you actually want to be friends with her?
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Nope but I want to be friends with her friends
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Well
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: That makes sense
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: What do you want to get out of this conversation
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to be friends with her
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: At a minimum?
10/14/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: I just don‚Äôt NEED to be friends with her
10/14/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: I just want her not to bring it up in 3 months and cite this as me being a bitch
10/14/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: So you're not going for an apology necessarily, maybe just an understanding?
10/14/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Sorry, Im not going to pry much more
10/14/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry you have to deal with this though
10/14/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: It's not your fault (obviously), and I think that you're important enough to your friends that if they have to side with someone, it'll definitely be you
10/14/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: I just hope you get your apology and the world can keep spinning for her
10/14/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Well
10/14/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: I'm going to bed
10/14/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: But I hope everything goes well tonight
10/14/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna throw on the album and just hang for a bit, but I'll say a quick prayer for you and your conversation
10/14/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! I'll talk to you tomorrow
10/14/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Also, if you have any time, keep looking into where to go in December because I can't wait to see you again
10/14/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I'll totally do Nuremberg, even if it's a little hard for me to get there
10/14/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: The only thing is that if it takes me that long to go/come from there, it cuts the weekend shorter than it can be
10/14/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: But anyway
10/14/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! I'll talk to you tomorrow!
10/14/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Sorry phone call was a lot
10/14/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even want to type it all out
10/14/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: End of the day I‚Äôd still do anything for her no matter how much she‚Äôs gonna make me feel shitty about myself occasionally
10/14/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think she means it but it‚Äôs just annoying to deal with
10/14/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: But thanks for the well wishes
10/14/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah I will
10/14/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: This week and next are midterms so I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôll be able to not work
10/14/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find time to procrastinate
10/14/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: But when‚Äôs your last class friday?  Like how soon could you get to the airport?
10/14/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: And hey you‚Äôre so sweet and good
10/14/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd like a hug too and the lack of hug is totally unhygge but alas I will manage until I see you again
10/14/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: I hope you dream well
10/14/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm gonna eat the remainder of the paprikas and make myself a strong gin and tonic
10/14/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Also I think you left your lense filters on my desk for veev and also I apparently stole another shirt I just took the black one with the sun out of the washer...sorry
10/14/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: You just really have to come back
10/14/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Or I could send them back with Margaux who is visiting next weekend
10/14/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Now that I think of it
10/14/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Not the shirt that smells like you
10/14/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: If that‚Äôs okay
10/14/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôve told you that certain smells are comforting to me?  I didn‚Äôt realize until you left but yours has started doing that whatever that means
10/14/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Heya
10/14/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Okay it's 4am so I can give a more fleshed out response when I'm _actually_ awake
10/14/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: First off, you're a wonderful friend. I know it might feel like there are issues and drama and you're not being appreciated or respected, but the couple people I know absolutely love you. Whenever they talk about you, their eyes light up and it's super obvious what you mean to them. It's easy to forget the good ones when you get caught up on a bad one, so I just want to remind you of that
10/14/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: Second off, I'll _maaaaaybe_ let you cash in on that hug, but hey I can probably be convinced üòâ
10/14/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: And third, well shoot, I actually really like that shirt
10/14/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Maybe packing in like 15 minutes wasn't a good idea. It's not my fault SOMEONE _cough cough_ was making me want to finish really really quickly
10/14/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Jk it's not your fault, I probably would have done that anyway, you just gave me a great excuse :)
10/14/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Anyway, you can absolutely keep one of the shirts. If one smells significantly better or reminds you of me more, keep that. Otherwise, if they're equal, can you send back the one with the sun on it? That was a gift from Calvin so I'm a little sentimental
10/14/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Alright, that's it for me
10/14/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Gonna pass out again
10/14/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Goodnight, I'm sorry I can't hug you right now, but I promise things will get better
10/14/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: They always do
10/14/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: Oh man go back to bed
10/14/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: I may even be awake when you wake up for good
10/14/19, 10:04 PM - Marianna: But thank you for your kind words
10/14/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôll send the sun one back with Margaux
10/14/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Or at least try to remember
10/14/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: It did go through the wash because I didn‚Äôt realize it was yours so it just smells clean (you‚Äôre welcome)
10/14/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay!
10/14/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got robin and Hungarian homework!
10/14/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Oo yeah no you should avoid that
10/14/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Good luck with everything, especially the post gin and tonic homework
10/14/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Night!
10/15/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm calling it quits ive talked to my parents and done a little homework and am excited for a good 8 hrs of sleep rn
10/15/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm gonna put on the album which means goodnight caleb!  Remember that the world (especially the fancy smancy conference) is your oyster
10/15/19, 4:29 AM - Caleb: Oh wow just re-read some of those and realized that I literally restated what you said and didn't see like 4 texts
10/15/19, 4:30 AM - Caleb: Sorry, sleepy eyes don't work so good I guess
10/15/19, 4:30 AM - Caleb: Also I swear I'm gonna smack siddhesh at some point
10/15/19, 4:30 AM - Caleb: I could rant for an hour at this point, and I've only been around him for 3 days now?
10/15/19, 4:31 AM - Caleb: Like, this morning we woke up, and I asked if he was gonna shower and wanted to go first
10/15/19, 4:31 AM - Caleb: And he literally said, "are you an idiot? Of course I am, stop wasting your and my time."
10/15/19, 4:32 AM - Caleb: Like, dude, I'm just tryna see if you want to shower before I do
10/15/19, 4:32 AM - Caleb: He's just such an abrasive person
10/15/19, 4:37 AM - Caleb: OH also I got an answer to your question of how Chinese students do research
10/15/19, 4:38 AM - Caleb: I asked one, and he said that you can't use Baidu for research, it's all ads and bad results
10/15/19, 4:38 AM - Caleb: And if there is something, it's heavily biased
10/15/19, 4:38 AM - Caleb: So if you want to do any research, you need to use a VPN
10/15/19, 4:39 AM - Caleb: Some universities even allow their students to have VPNs, which is pretty much the only way to find scholarly articles
10/15/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Good morning
10/15/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Ooh yeah I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to be around someone who answers benign questions like that
10/15/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: And ooooh that‚Äôs super interesting about the research
10/15/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: Thanks for asking about it and getting back to me!
10/15/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: What‚Äôs on the docket for today?
10/15/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Oh wait does that sentence make sense?  Docket is like list of court cases for a chamber for a day in order of them being heard. Idk if everyone know what that is but I was just asking like what‚Äôs on the schedule haha
10/15/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: Ha no worries I figured that's what you meant
10/15/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: Good morning though!
10/15/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: It's mostly keynotes and oral presentations today
10/15/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: And like two poster sessions
10/15/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: Tbh nothing that is super interesting besides some segmentation algorithms
10/15/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: Some really interesting network architectures though
10/15/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: It just sucks that we're in China, because I keep seeing cool things I want to learn about, and my first instinct is to just Google it
10/15/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: But I can't, so a lot of it is over my head tbh
10/15/19, 9:34 AM - Caleb: But yeah it's not a super interesting day
10/15/19, 9:34 AM - Caleb: Tomorrow and Thursday will definitely be better
10/15/19, 9:35 AM - Caleb: And then I'M DONE! I really don't know what I'll do for a day and a half though
10/15/19, 9:35 AM - Caleb: Tbh I just want to get to the airport early
10/15/19, 9:35 AM - Caleb: What's on your docket today?
10/15/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah the whole when in doubt and interested google it doesn‚Äôt exactly work right now
10/15/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Is there nothing going on for the conference after Thursday?  Why is your flight 2 days later then?
10/15/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: And I have Hungarian class and then lots of studying
10/15/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm gonna actually go to a cafe I found and work maybe
10/15/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: It looks more like a library inside with big tables
10/15/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs on the buda side
10/15/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: But we‚Äôll see if I elect just to stay in bed and work
10/15/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Yeah conference ends Thursday night
10/15/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: I figured I could have like one day to just do something fun, and then a day to pack and hit the aiport
10/15/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: But now I'm just wishing I was heading back
10/15/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: And you know what
10/15/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: STAYüëèINüëèBEDüëè
10/15/19, 10:26 AM - Caleb: IT'S. SO. COZY.
10/15/19, 10:29 AM - Caleb: But hey I'll be your cheerleader either way
10/15/19, 10:29 AM - Caleb: Book Cafe sounds cozy
10/15/19, 10:29 AM - Caleb: I just know that I personally wouldn't be productive
10/15/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs kind of smart
10/15/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Are you allowed to take pictures like outside?  You could take veev and explore
10/15/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Well now I‚Äôm at school for Hungarian
10/15/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: But I want to at least try to be productive somewhere else
10/15/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: My apartment also isn‚Äôt clean and I can‚Äôt do work very well when there‚Äôs a mess
10/15/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôd have to clean up
10/15/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Which is maybe a good idea anyway
10/15/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah thats the plan
10/15/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: I've already got some really interesting photos
10/15/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: And yeaaaaah
10/15/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: It's a double edged sword
10/15/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: But cleaning is the best procrastination and thats my official stance
10/15/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: I'm also just not sure where to go with Veev
10/15/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Especially since I have no internet, so I cant easily bail myself out of situations
10/15/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: But now that I know the metro system, as long as I stay within most of the city I'll be fine
10/15/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Ooooh I can‚Äôt wait to see when you get back
10/15/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Yeah but I don‚Äôt want to do the cleaning so I procrastinate the cleaning which is procrastinating what I actual need to do
10/15/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Low key I miss just having a room and not an apartment
10/15/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Like I liked only having my new dorm or belk room to clean and not a kitchen
10/15/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: And yeah please don‚Äôt get lost
10/15/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: But I believe in your ability to find your way around
10/15/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Maybe
10/15/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: At least by reading signs and asking people
10/15/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Well
10/15/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: I'm now at the miccai gala
10/15/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: It's a bit wild
10/15/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: It's gonna be an interesting night
10/15/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: But yeah I know what you're saying
10/15/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Space is just so hard to maintain, especially when you don't need it all
10/15/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Oooooh I love galas
10/15/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Have so much fun

10/15/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: :(
10/15/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: But may have a fun living situation next semester if some things get worked out soonish
10/15/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Yay
10/15/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: What's the situation
10/15/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: No no not bad fun

10/15/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Interesting fun
10/15/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Gala first!
10/15/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Please
10/15/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: But the gala was really interesting
10/15/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: It was called "a taste of China" and was a buffet of 9 different Chinese cuisines
10/15/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Oh okay
10/15/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: I mean boring days aren‚Äôt bad soemtimes
10/15/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: And it was all sorts of Chinese dances and music and festivities
10/15/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: And THEN
10/15/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: THEN we went to this live danceish show? It was a lot of music and dancing and really impressive choreography
10/15/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: It told all sorts of traditional Chinese folk tales
10/15/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Then half of our group broke off, and at this point is was two British docs, Spyros, and I
10/15/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: And we went around this Chinese park that's been decorated for Halloween and it was SO SO SO BEAUTIFUL
10/15/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: We did a haunted house, they made me go first
10/15/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: And then Spyros got souvenirs for his kids, and the whole night I was being the translator for him and the two British docs
10/15/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: And at one point I'm in a really heated discussion about wrapping paper with a store clerk
10/15/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: And I finally get him to give me bubble wrap
10/15/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: And I knew I made it
10/15/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: But then we all went to a restaurant, got a $70 bottle of wine, drank it, and then siddhesh and friends found us
10/15/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: So then it was a little less fun
10/15/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: But still a super exciting night
10/15/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: It was super cool meeting the brits, they were both really nice and fun to hang out with
10/15/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: The one loved Winnie the Pooh, and the other, oh my gosh she was just hilarious
10/15/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
10/15/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: the story is too

10/15/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: NO
10/15/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: THAT PARK
10/15/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah but also the Pic doesn't do it justice
10/15/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm shook by it
10/15/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Here's another
10/15/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: Wow oh wow oh wow
10/15/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Oh sweet goodness
10/15/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: I miss cooking with Marianna
10/15/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: (and the show too)
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: Awwww
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: Cooking with Caleb wasn‚Äôt too bad either
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: To be continued
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: I had the rest of the quiche Saturday when I woke up at 3 pm
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: Yes
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Oooo
10/15/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Nothing like a Saturday morning quiche
10/15/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: Or fritada I guess
10/15/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: ANYWAY
10/15/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: How was your day

10/15/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Uh I'm fine with this

10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs so pretty
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Almost reminds me of tivoli like the photos you sent me
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Same kind of vibe
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Except hecka Asian
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry you didn't see Tivoli
10/15/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Update I think I‚Äôve grown to like the taste of gin
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: We did walk past it
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Just luck of the draw when I went
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah but it's definitely not the same
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm looking at Nuremberg stuff
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Well have to call when you get home
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: And wait did you not like gin before
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Hmmm I can live with that :)
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Not really
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Wait did you get that gin just for me
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: ...maybe
10/15/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: You got me rum
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: YOU ARE SO SWEET
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: So I went and got gin
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: WHAT
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: THE
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: HECK
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But now I have leftovers
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: So good for me!
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah but I mentioned that I like gin like once
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: I'm amazed you remembered that
10/15/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve had like 1 gin and tonic at a bar because I remember that‚Äôs your favorite drink right?  So I wanted to try it
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Ha my memory can be good soemtimes
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Not always
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: And it's grown on you?
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Usually not when I‚Äôm in a test
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Hey I don't expect it to be always
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Ah, well that's just unfortunate
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: But anyway
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I always feel awful when people are like oh I think I told you this and I‚Äôm like yes but I have no recollection of it
10/15/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Oh no that's me 90% of the time
10/15/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Or I'll tell someone something and they'll be like "yeah you said this already"
10/15/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: And I'm like "OK I swear I don't go around telling everyone"
10/15/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: So just know I'll never be hurt if you don't keep track of everything I say or do or offhand mention
10/15/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: However, gotta say, it's extremely thoughtful that you did
10/15/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Thank you
10/15/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: But yeah you have so much going on that I won't ever expect you to keep track of every little thing
10/15/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: I like hearing people‚Äôs stories I don‚Äôt usually care if I hear them multiple times
10/15/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: And Ha thank you for not expecting me to be perfect
10/15/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Good to know
10/15/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Anyway
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: My day
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: Got waffles for lunch with the gang!
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: Hey as someone who's been on the other side of that expectation, its better to just say it outright than to have guilt forever
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOSH
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: THAT
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: LOOKS
10/15/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: MMMM
10/15/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Also, it's 1:30 so I really need to go to bed
10/15/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: But I'm glad we got to talk for a bit
10/15/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: We'll (hopefully) talk more tomorrow
10/15/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
10/15/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: What that‚Äôs crazy sorry but no one is perfect
10/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre pretty close but I don‚Äôt expect ya to be
10/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: But yeah please sleep
10/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: I need to proofread Sarah‚Äôs application anyway
10/15/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
10/15/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Update we just discovered that we have a drenga (drunk Jenga) game in our apartment but we don‚Äôt know all the tiles so I‚Äôm gonna rewrite some of them so we can actually play
10/15/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Also: thoughts on Barcelona that weekend we want to meet up?  It‚Äôs like a 80‚Ç¨ round trip flight for both of us and relatively cheap for this one Airbnb I found and it has a Christmas market that‚Äôs been going for 225 years and I‚Äôd get to speak spanish and I was gonna go with sarah but there is never a flight that leaves early enough for her any weekend so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to go otherwise. But if you don‚Äôt want to, I can keep looking into places!
10/15/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Okay now I‚Äôm in bed but wanted to let you know you‚Äôre awesome and my final update for my day is my friends and I did drinking homework and it was quite nice and now I‚Äôm ready for sleep
10/15/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: So goodnight part 2!
10/16/19, 3:34 AM - Caleb: WHAT HOW DID WE NOT SEE THIS
10/16/19, 3:35 AM - Caleb: Barcelona would be fantastic! The winter market is less important to me because Copenhagen has one, but if that's important to you and Barcelona will have a cool one, then that's awesome
10/16/19, 3:36 AM - Caleb: We'll call when I get back to work out details and book
10/16/19, 3:36 AM - Caleb: I've always wanted to go to Spain anyway
10/16/19, 3:36 AM - Caleb: As long as you don't mind playing translator üòÅ
10/16/19, 5:17 AM - Caleb: Update: if I'm lucky, I can refrain from smacking siddhesh today
10/16/19, 5:18 AM - Caleb: Honestly I'm trying to avoid him as much as possible, but he hunts me down and has LITERALLY been telling me that all my research is a waste of time and I'm an idiot and what I'm trying to do is impossivle
10/16/19, 5:18 AM - Caleb: Using many of those exact words
10/16/19, 5:19 AM - Caleb: And then he turns around and says it's frustrating that no one had done what I'm trying to do, and then I explain that it's what I'm trying, and HE JUST REFUSES TO LISTNEN
10/16/19, 5:19 AM - Caleb: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
10/16/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: To was in the cupboard by the front door
10/16/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: It**
10/16/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: And well remember I haven‚Äôt taken or spoken Spanish since senior yeah
10/16/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: Yeah Budapest has one too but I thought it would have been fun and christmassy with you
10/16/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: But Nuremberg would be more expensive and harder to get to believe it or not
10/16/19, 7:13 AM - Marianna: And got to say I do not see any redeeming qualities in siddhesh
10/16/19, 7:13 AM - Marianna: Yeah I don‚Äôt know the guy I only hear little things like this
10/16/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: But honestly if I were you I think by now I would have fired back telling him to shut up I don‚Äôt want to hear his opinion on my research because all he‚Äôs doing is putting me and my work down which is highly unprofessional and also rude
10/16/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: But anyway
10/16/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: Good morning!
10/16/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: IT'S GONNA BE SO CUTE
10/16/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: I'm already hype
10/16/19, 7:23 AM - Caleb: I'm 100% getting a scarf and you can't stop me
10/16/19, 7:23 AM - Caleb: And yeah
10/16/19, 7:23 AM - Caleb: This is what happened after siddhesh said that
10/16/19, 7:23 AM - Caleb: I told him to shut up and this is what I was trying to do, and if he was just going to be combative I'm going ignore him
10/16/19, 7:24 AM - Caleb: To which he replied: "do you hate me because I tell the truth?"
10/16/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: And I said: "no Im pissed because you're being a huge fucking asshole and refusing to listen to me. Are you even genuinely confused or are you just trying to fuck with me?"
10/16/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: So I _may_ have snapped a little bit
10/16/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: Anyway
10/16/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: More fun topics
10/16/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: Good morning! How's the day looking?
10/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: Yes yes
10/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: As soon as you get home we‚Äôll talk about it!
10/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: I support the scarf
10/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt get him
10/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: I know spyros said it‚Äôs just kind of him
10/16/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt get it genuinely
10/16/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt see how any person can be that grating and get away with it
10/16/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: But anyway
10/16/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm still in bed but I really do need to get up
10/16/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: And o have class until 6pm :(
10/16/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: But Mia is coming this afternoon!
10/16/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: Yeah I might end up talking to Spyros about it
10/16/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: Because he's really smart and hardworking but oh my GOSH he's just so hard to work with
10/16/19, 7:57 AM - Caleb: Not exactly a team player
10/16/19, 7:58 AM - Caleb: Like it would even be fine if I was having to work with him and it was hard, but he literally gets in the way of me just trying to do my own work
10/16/19, 7:59 AM - Caleb: It's not just a benign thoughness, it's malignant and spreading to me just trying to mind my own business
10/16/19, 7:59 AM - Caleb: Anyway, we can move on
10/16/19, 8:00 AM - Caleb: Oof on the class until 6, I'm sorry to hear that
10/16/19, 8:00 AM - Caleb: But hey maybe class will be fun!
10/16/19, 8:01 AM - Caleb: And yay for Mia coming! Do you know her/are you friends? Or is it just Sarah
10/16/19, 7:31 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt love Mia mostly because I don‚Äôt know her but also I get some kind of weird vibe from her like my first impression wasn‚Äôt great of her which I usually trust a lot but sarah loves her so gosh darn am I gonna try to grow to love her in the next few days
10/16/19, 8:06 AM - Caleb: Ah
10/16/19, 8:07 AM - Caleb: I mean that makes sense
10/16/19, 8:07 AM - Caleb: You can't really control your first impression of someone, but you can definitely try to get to know them regardless
10/16/19, 8:07 AM - Caleb: I'm sure it'll mean a lot to Sarah
10/16/19, 8:07 AM - Caleb: Are you guys planning anything with her?
10/16/19, 8:21 AM - Marianna: I may actually switch into the mobile class A section that goes from 2-4 instead today so I can let Mia into the apartment because I usually have that free and then mobile class B section from 4-6. It‚Äôs the same material so I‚Äôm pretty sure it will be fine
10/16/19, 8:21 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve hung out with her a few times but don‚Äôt really know more than what sarah has told me
10/16/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: She‚Äôs the one that gave us alcohol before winterfest
10/16/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: So I hung out with her there and frolics
10/16/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: So really not too much
10/16/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: And idk I‚Äôm sure sarah is planning things to do with her. I think the plan is to go out tonight. Devansh might be throwing a bigger pregame like he did last Thursday that you went to
10/16/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: Margaux and some other cope people are here this weekend so I was gonna show them around
10/16/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: And there‚Äôs an all AIT party on Friday themed ‚ÄúTransyl-bae-nia‚Äù spooky pregame/party that someone‚Äôs throwing so people can find their baes in Transylvania
10/16/19, 8:25 AM - Marianna: I wonder if isti can make it that night
10/16/19, 8:25 AM - Marianna: But Mia will probably go to that if she wants to but sarah said she might not which idk why not and I hope that means sarah doesn‚Äôt want to go
10/16/19, 9:46 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhhh yeah that might be a good call
10/16/19, 9:46 AM - Caleb: But I can confirm that Budapest ain't too bad to just hang out in
10/16/19, 9:46 AM - Caleb: That's fun though! And who knows _maybe_ Ishti will be there
10/16/19, 9:47 AM - Caleb: But he's gotta breakup with Bara first though
10/16/19, 9:47 AM - Caleb: And they've been together for like 6 months and 3 days by now
10/16/19, 9:47 AM - Caleb: So gooooood luck with that
10/16/19, 9:48 AM - Caleb: Ishti jokes aside, we gotta take note of some of these party ideas because theyre amazing
10/16/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs a cool place
10/16/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: Man our theory prof is a tough grader
10/16/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: Did not do well on the homework from last week
10/16/19, 9:58 AM - Marianna: Which just puts me in a bad mood because it makes me question my ability to do this stuff
10/16/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: And I have to do this weeks homework tonight but I‚Äôm so not sure I can do it and I‚Äôll have to do it by myself because the girl we usually collaborate with is taking the midterm tomorrow so shes got other stuff to do and sarah will have Mia and has network homework to do so idk when she‚Äôll do it
10/16/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: So ah
10/16/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Whatever
10/16/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been?  Hopefully better than this
10/16/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: Well, some people are just excessive
10/16/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: You're more than capable, and even if you don't get it on the first try, I fully fully believe in your ability to get it
10/16/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: Just stick with it, you got this
10/16/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: I hope you can get someone else to work with you though, that always makes things better
10/16/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: My days been pretty good! Besides siddhesh's usual stuff, it's been pretty good
10/16/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: Mostly posters and booths, I talked to a lot of people
10/16/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: There was this one guy selling software and scanners and I kinda kept breaking the demo so I felt kinda bad
10/16/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: But also demos should probably be idiot proof out of principle, so not tooootally my fault
10/16/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: Other than that, just took a nap
10/16/19, 10:24 AM - Caleb: Keynotes were eh
10/16/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: There was a good one this morning, but I only caught the end of it
10/16/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: And the closing ceremony is in about an hour!
10/16/19, 10:25 AM - Caleb: Oh and I'm maybe going lens shopping with Spyros here because they're about 1/5 the price of the US
10/16/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: Sarahs like oh idk if I want to do theory tonight _because Mia_ and I‚Äôm like well she‚Äôs gonna be here until Sunday she can do homework tonight and I helped her with comp bio when you were here so I‚Äôm feeling more one sided expectations again
10/16/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: But yeah demos shouldn‚Äôt break maybe
10/16/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you got a nap
10/16/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt there more stuff tomorrow though?
10/16/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: And ooh that sounds smart about the lens
10/16/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Yeah there's more stuff tomorrow
10/16/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: (including me!) but they just have a cerimony before most people skip town
10/16/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Sorry about Sarah and Mia though
10/16/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: That does sound kind of unfair. Did you help her when I was there by any chance?
10/16/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/16/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: Wait a second did I ever tell you why I started drinking these
10/16/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: Also, I think maybe you should talk with her soon if you've been feeling like this repeatedly
10/16/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: You're going to be roommates next semester, which will really exasperate things if it doesn't get addressed
10/16/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Yeah I did
10/16/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I pointed out that I did
10/16/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: I think she was like oh yeah I guess
10/16/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: So I think she‚Äôll still be able to work with me
10/16/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: I think we have different routines for doing homework like multiple times she‚Äôs had to do different classes homework when I needed her to do work with me or at least sit with me when I cook but she can‚Äôt because she has other work so It‚Äôs not entirely her fault but also she does put homework off soemtimes and then is stressed so she has to put the work I want to do off until later than I‚Äôd like to do it
10/16/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Which is fine
10/16/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: And remember I‚Äôm the kind of person who would rather just get over it and not bring it up. It doesn‚Äôt really bother me believe it or not
10/16/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm much more of a ugh I‚Äôm gonna complain but it‚Äôs not really gonna upset me
10/16/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: So nah I‚Äôll let it go
10/16/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre playing jazz on live instruments in graphisoft Park like where AIT is
10/16/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: Nice little soundtrack to walk to lunch to
10/16/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: Update we‚Äôve all come up with our grandparent names at lunch it‚Äôs so fun
10/16/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Conference is over!
10/16/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Now we're all grabbing a drink to unwind
10/16/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: And that makes sense about Sarah
10/16/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Talking about things only helps sometimes
10/16/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: I just hope that things do settle and you can live well together
10/16/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Also I'm gonna need clarification on that one
10/16/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: Yay!  Congrats!  Done your first conference!  Or at least officially!  But you‚Äôre still gonna kill it tomorrow!
10/16/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: I think we do
10/16/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: (Live well together)
10/16/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: And like we were coming up with funny thinks grandkids or like nieces and nephews could call each other like josh was grandpa jo pa
10/16/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Thanks üòÅ
10/16/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: And ooooh that's fun
10/16/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: I wonder what mine would be
10/16/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Grandpa Cuub maybe?
10/16/19, 1:44 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/16/19, 2:23 PM - Caleb: Dearest Marianna: you'd hate me for what I just tried
10/16/19, 2:23 PM - Caleb: $25 glass of rum
10/16/19, 2:23 PM - Caleb: Thanks Spyros
10/16/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: Update it was actually Michel
10/16/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Wait a second what was yours???
10/16/19, 4:52 PM - Caleb: Hey rAnDoM question
10/16/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: I mean if they also can‚Äôt say Ls then cuub seems likely
10/16/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: And ooooh
10/16/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm in class caleb and you‚Äôre taunting me with delicious looking alc
10/16/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm out of class but now it‚Äôs cold and raining which was 100% not in the forecast so I am 100% not dressed for it
10/16/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: But I did go to the earlier class so I can go get Mia which made sarah very happy so I think she will make time to work on theory tonight yay
10/16/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: #doingthingsforothers
10/16/19, 4:53 PM - Caleb: What do you say to a guy thats super depressed and is willing to throw his future away for a girl that cheated on him
10/16/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Ah look at you being a good person
10/16/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Such an altruist
10/16/19, 4:55 PM - Caleb: Also idk if you follow baseball but GO NATIONALS
10/16/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: OH CRAP OH CRAP OH CRAP
10/16/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: ANANT MADABHUSHI IS COMING TO MY PRESENTATION
10/16/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
10/16/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: THAT'S LIKE HAVING MICHAEL JORDAN COME TO YOUR SHITTY PICKUP BASKETBALL GAME
10/16/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: THAT'S LIKE HAVING HOPE SOLO COME TO YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL SOCCER GAME
10/16/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: THAT'S LIKE HAVING JO√ãL ROBUCHON WATCH YOU COOK
10/16/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: Well was it worth it?
10/16/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: The fancy smancy rum**
10/16/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: And I have no qualms about it when people who are like probably pretty well off doctors are paying for it
10/16/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: Like I have an uncle who‚Äôs a defense attorney and I never feel guilty about getting random gifts from him because he‚Äôs fine spending money
10/16/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: And well I am pretty sure in reality I‚Äôll be nonna one day but marghi (like Margie)
10/16/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: HEY YOU GOT THIS
10/16/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: YOURE STUFF IS SO PHENOMENAL
10/16/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Nonna marghi, very nice
10/16/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Good ring to it
10/16/19, 5:34 PM - Caleb: And oh yeah, radiologists get paid too much anyway üòÖ
10/16/19, 5:34 PM - Caleb: He's super nice though, really funny guy from France
10/16/19, 5:34 PM - Caleb: I didn't really know him well before this though
10/16/19, 5:34 PM - Caleb: Gotta say though
10/16/19, 5:34 PM - Caleb: You could taste the wood in the rum
10/16/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Exceptional flavor
10/16/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Didn't bite at all
10/16/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Felt very warm
10/16/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Would recommend trying
10/16/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Not paying for
10/16/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: One thing I want to do next semester is just have my own bottle of reasonably nice alcohol and glasses that I break out for special occasions
10/16/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: Update my impression of Mia has not changed she‚Äôs very much a know it all and likes to tell you she has seen and knows more than you and has better stories than you
10/16/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been home less than an hour
10/16/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: Idk what to do
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: You done with classes then?
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: But oooh that sounds nice
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah!
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Say you have work to do!
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Escape to your room!
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Go to that cute book Cafe!
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: Need to do theory homework though
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: And I kind of like the bite of alcohol
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm in here now
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Caleb: Okay no fair you're beating me to these because they refuse to send
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird
10/16/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like like any of Sarahs friends
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Like I never liked owen he was grating
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Like before all the drama happened
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Oh man
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: What
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Well she's got one good one
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: If that means anything
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Also I'd like to be Sarah's friend
10/16/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: (if you're okay with that)
10/16/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: I'm sending messages and they don't deliver for about a minute
10/16/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: So there's a lil latency, sorry boot that
10/16/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Idk I‚Äôm worried that I wouldn‚Äôt like me
10/16/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Like does sarah just pick bad friends
10/16/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôm joking
10/16/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just weird
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Damn, are you actually worried about that a little bit?
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôd think individual friends would like people they share a common main friend with
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah for real
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: I think it's okay to not though
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a little off putting
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Like I really didn‚Äôt like Owen and have no idea what she saw in him as a friend
10/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: And Mia is doing absolutely nothing for me
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: And she‚Äôs not close with any of my friends
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm kind of glad Mia graduated though at least sarah won‚Äôt force us to hang out
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: I also for the record get along with almost everyone
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs rare I don‚Äôt
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Which is possibly why this is unsettling me so much
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: I mean it doesn't sound like you guys are butting heads
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: No it‚Äôs not that
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: It's just not your preference to hang with her
10/16/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: And that's absolutely fine to have
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Yeah I guess
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: I've been in that situation before
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: And I guess I see similarities between us that sarah night like
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: And I've realized that right not, they might not be the same person they've been
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: But man I hope I‚Äôm not this annoying
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: So Sarah might see things that they used to be
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: No I‚Äôm pretty sure it is
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: And not how they are now
10/16/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Because this is the same vibe I got last time
10/16/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: I was showing her pictures of my cooler and she was like oh I can one up you and showed me her cooler she made and was like no no look at the top isnt it spectacular like focusing my attention on how amazing it way
10/16/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: It was pretty amazing but there‚Äôs just something about how she‚Äôs bragging or talking about herself that‚Äôs like wow I don‚Äôt want to listen to this
10/16/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Maybe it‚Äôs insecurity that she‚Äôs Sarahs other best friend
10/16/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/16/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Anyway
10/16/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: What are you up to now?
10/16/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: Well
10/16/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: Making a billion edits to my paper because Michael Jackson is about to come to my 6th grade choir concert
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: OH NO SHE DIDN'T
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: AGGGGHHHHHH
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: I hate people that constantly one up other people
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: But you know what's worse than them?
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Exactly!
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: And no what‚Äôs worse
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: People that _two_ up everyone
10/16/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Although I may one up people or try occasionally
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: Oooh I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever encountered this
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: And hey
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre work is phenomenal
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: 'Tis just a joke
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: I already said that
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: But seriously
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Also it's totally okay that you do
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Just occasionally though
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs obnoxious
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: Yeah I don‚Äôt think I do that much
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: :)
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Marianna: I also think I only do to prove a point
10/16/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Thanks but my presentation isn't
10/16/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah that's fine
10/16/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Ah yes I did use the wrong you‚Äôre you‚Äôre right
10/16/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: If people are already in a competitive mood go for it
10/16/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: But oh my GOODNESS
10/16/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: I forget, did I text you that one time I went hiking with my friend Solomon and Andrew
10/16/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Andrew who's dating my ex
10/16/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: God bless him
10/16/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Oh I think you did but I forget details
10/16/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: I just remember one of them was being obnoxious and that‚Äôs why you go hiking alone
10/16/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Yep
10/16/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Yeeeep
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: _yeeeeeeeeeep_
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: Wait also you never reminded me why you like gin and tonics
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: Besides that they don‚Äôt taste like sugary mixed drinks
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Well its the first drink my dad ever bought me
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: And it was when I was touring Davison
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: What
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: How bold of dr Grenko
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: It was at the North Harbor Yaht Club on Lake Norman
10/16/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Indeed
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Wait how did he buy you a drink out?
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt that like not allowed?
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: (okay he bought it for himself but said he'd let me have some)
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: (fine)
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Oh okay that makes more sense
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Caught ya
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: :)
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: But he also had an unfinished drink and let me have almost the whole thing
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Still that‚Äôs a cool parenting move
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: _he_ stole a sip from _me_ ill have you know
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: But yeah
10/16/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Judy and tom would never
10/16/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: I have a super strong association of gin and tonics and falling in love with Davidson
10/16/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: My grandpa ones gave me his cherry out of his alcoholic drink out one time but that‚Äôs the closest
10/16/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: Awwwwwww
10/16/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: That is absolutely adorable
10/16/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: Ha
10/16/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: Getting crunk on basically palinka
10/16/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: Well no
10/16/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Palinka is so good
10/16/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna miss it
10/16/19, 5:57 PM - Marianna: Like genuinely
10/16/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Me too
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: (bring a bottle pls)
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: I thought I would have to deal with customs so I didn't get one in the airport
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: And I'm super bummed I didn't
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: I also wanted one as a gift for Spyros
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to swing that
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Remember I‚Äôm underage
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: I may bring one back for judy and tom to try
10/16/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: And just be like ah I‚Äôll take that with me when I go to davidson
10/16/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: Because they don‚Äôt like hard alcohol
10/16/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: ... Ah right
10/16/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: Well maybe to Barcelona then
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: We can get drunk on palinka and pretend we're in Budapest
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Marianna: Ha maybe
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Marianna: Or we can drink spanish wine
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: Marianna
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: You
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: You deleted this message
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Marianna: Or whatever hard alcohol they like there
10/16/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: Genius
10/16/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: Now you're speaking my language
10/16/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: Also I can't overstate how excited I am for this
10/16/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: WOOOO
10/16/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: (But in Spanish)
10/16/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: Anyway
10/16/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: How are you?
10/16/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: Good
10/16/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: Not very motivated to do work I don‚Äôt think
10/16/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: Which sucks because I need to
10/16/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: How are you?
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: Currently am debating how hard of an outline to make with this
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Marianna: Outline for what?
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: PRESENTATION!
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: Because usually I loosely rehearse once and then go for it
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Marianna: Oh wait something exciting on my end I‚Äôm gonna break out LaTeX for this hw
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: And winging it works incredibly well
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt you say that works better for you than having it perfectly memorized?
10/16/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: Oh hey by the way, did you actually want to read my paper?
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah definitely
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: I get super super nervous with presentations
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Have I not
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: I have awful staged right
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Stage fright
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Staged right
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: I know
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Staged right is just atrocious
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: I don't think so?
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: Unless I did
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Sorry that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be mean it sounds not nice
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Caleb: But it's honestly not super interesting
10/16/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: And oh maybe not
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Hey I want to
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: I mean you can also wait for the journal
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Oh I think you showed me graphs or something when I was in philly
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: But if ya want a peek
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah give me that good comp bio before it hits the press
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Ha yeah I think we got distracted
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: üò≥
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: BY PORK ROLL
10/16/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Obviously
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Caleb: Duh
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Oh man
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Caleb: Oh wait no that could be slang
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Caleb: Hang on
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Caleb: Uh
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: You know how I get when you talk about pork roll
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Caleb: ... Reading terminal?
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: But actually I love pork roll
10/16/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to even think how that could be slang
10/16/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: Oh we got distracted by construction Moises
10/16/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: Noises
10/16/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: That's it
10/16/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: Uh huh
10/16/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Honestly probably
10/16/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: It was quite annoying and distrusting
10/16/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah welcome to my world
10/16/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: My sweet sweet world of sleep deprivation
10/16/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: But hey that's partially out fault
10/16/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: Mug wine doesn't do time any favors
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: We really are bad at sleeping
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs shocking to me honeslty
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: Me too
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: I know how much you love sleep
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: Idk when the last time I‚Äôve stayed up to 3 hanging out with someone was
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: Aw
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: :)
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: But we're gonna need to work on that
10/16/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: Because I'm not opposed to you staying over on school nights
10/16/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: Like, _super_ not opposed
10/16/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: As long as we actually get sleep and it doesn't get in the way of school
10/16/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: But also it's up to you and if I actually have a single
10/16/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: (pls Walter)
10/16/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm glad to hear that
10/16/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Not gonna lie though that sounds like such a foreign concept for me right now
10/16/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: Like full disclosure I‚Äôm so used to sleeping by myself now
10/16/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: Not that I‚Äôm opposed at all
10/16/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: I just realized besides this week and a few weekends with you it‚Äôs been a good long while since it hasn‚Äôt just been me and mr pig (and all the other animals I suppose)
10/16/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: But very not opposed
10/16/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: But I agree with the caveat about school
10/16/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah I mean also I don't need an answer or anything right nwo
10/16/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Did you ever figure out your rooming situation?
10/16/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Oh I never told you about mine!
10/16/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: I just feel like we also finally figured out how to sleep together without it being a furnace or freezing
10/16/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Or arm numbing
10/16/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: Oh good point
10/16/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Oh! Yeah what's the dealio
10/16/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: So
10/16/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: I'm emailing Hannah about rooms when I get back btw
10/16/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: Elena is currently in a dingle in duke in a suite where Phelps (her friend who is also in warner but low key cray cray in my opinion) is in the adjoining dingle
10/16/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: So they realize they are going to be given roommates in the spring
10/16/19, 6:22 PM - Marianna: So she recommended trying to get rlo to move her in with Phelps and then sarah and I move into the other side
10/16/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Like we‚Äôd rather have new dorm or fourth belk but at least this way we know we‚Äôll be together and not 3 people in a lounge
10/16/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: We haven‚Äôt talked to rlo about it yet but I image they won‚Äôt have an issue. We‚Äôre just waiting for Sarahs parents to get back on whether the price difference is okay
10/16/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: But Elena said they want chillers on the other side of their suite and they promise to keep the bathroom clean and it would be nice to have all warner gals and to be so close to Elena
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: My
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: Goodness
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: That sounds like a grand ol crazy time
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: I'm happy something worked out
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: RLO will have no issue with it
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Well it hasn‚Äôt officially worked out yet
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: I'm like 99% sure that you could swing that
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Okay yeah I‚Äôd imagine it makes their life easier if we all work it out ourselves
10/16/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: But make sure to email RLO soon
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: They set their rooms fairly early
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah we‚Äôre going to as soon as Sarahs dad says it‚Äôs all good
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: And if they can figure out an ideal situation early on, they'd be very happy
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: Also hey listen to this
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/3iJya7m7trpGv570Ske30n?si=MOoxEbAWSDGsXZ1us-lxAA
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a little worried Elena is going to expect me to be on the petty level I was last semester but I don‚Äôt really plan to be
10/16/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: But then again I might get back and want to again
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: I do love my crazy warner fam
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Petty level?
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: I dont think I've heard about this
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: OH
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Party**
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Party
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Yeah gotcha
10/16/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: I hope you don't
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Elena was talking about how her tolerance has gone up and she can drink vodka like water
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: UHHHHHH
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm a lil concerned for her
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll be a good big influence
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Maybe
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Hey I was mostly fine last semester
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre aiming for no blackouts this semester though
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Thank you mr pre med
10/16/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: Marianna I'm hoping that the bar is a little higher than that
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: For both you and me
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Uhhhh
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: Bolth
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Wait actually why isn‚Äôt that a good bar
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: I feel like that‚Äôs a pretty good bar as the absolute bottom
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: Are we aiming for the absolute bottom?
10/16/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Oh and I LIKE the song
10/16/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: No we‚Äôre not aiming for the absolute bottom but we‚Äôre acknowledging that I have fun when I get drunk with my friends I‚Äôm the safe environment that is campus but we are gonna aim not to blackout because that‚Äôs worrying
10/16/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: Ah okay okay
10/16/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the absolute bottom we don‚Äôt ever want to reach
10/16/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: You know what that's fair
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: I'm just hoping for a fun semester
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: Me too
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure it will be good
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: I guess I shouldn't be one to talk considering I haven't set super concrete goals
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: Spring semester is always so fun
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: Fer sure
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: F R O L I C S
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: Oof
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: No frolics yet
10/16/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: My liver is still recovering from last frolics
10/16/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: I just like the spring vibe on campus
10/16/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Ha
10/16/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: And here you missed out on the freshman everclear bucket
10/16/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Shame
10/16/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Oh yes
10/16/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Sober marianna would have loved being at that party
10/16/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Really weird how much we like almost bumped into each other but never did
10/16/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Update I'm gonna whack siddhesh
10/16/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: He's really doing it to me
10/16/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: He asked me to show him my slides, which i ran though
10/16/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: And then started timing me
10/16/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: And then interrupting me
10/16/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: And then at the end hit me with dick questions and told me the audience will do that
10/16/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: And it's 1 am
10/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Whack him!
10/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: I mean don‚Äôt
10/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt condone violence
10/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sorry
10/16/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a shitty thing to do
10/16/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs probably just trying to be helpful but there is a difference between being crass and rude and putting down someone‚Äôs work and doing critique that is productive and helpful
10/16/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd be happy to WhatsApp video to see you practice but I‚Äôm not sure that will work
10/16/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/16/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Thanks for the offer but I also think sleep might just be the best thing at this point
10/16/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Idk how I'm going to swing that though
10/16/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: And yeah
10/16/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: I should be easier on siddhesh though
10/16/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: He's also probably going through a lot of stress
10/16/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah I figured
10/16/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah but that‚Äôs not an excuse to be crappy to you
10/16/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre going through stress because of it and outside of it
10/16/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: But like more when he‚Äôs a dick
10/16/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Ugh I just want to be home
10/16/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: None of this is fun right now

10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Like if you don‚Äôt stay at the conference I doubt he‚Äôll be able to find you
10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: I'll figure it out tomorrow
10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll go to some cool markers
10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Or the park
10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Oh that's like a full day
10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Woah

10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: I don't want to be mean though
10/16/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Like, he's frustrating but it doesn't license me being a jerk to him
10/16/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Uh yes it does
10/16/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing to you
10/16/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Just in a passive and not aggressive way
10/16/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: I don't want to perpetuate it though
10/16/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: But I also don't want to be around it
10/16/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Ughh
10/16/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: I feel like it‚Äôs gonna perpetuate whatever you do
10/16/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Not to be doomsday
10/16/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: But he doesn‚Äôt seem to respond when you say yo dude stop being mean
10/16/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah
10/16/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: He's not good with that
10/16/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: He also touches me a lot
10/16/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And I've asked him to drop
10/16/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: Stop *
10/16/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: And I've also asked him to stop giving me shit, or every time it comes up that I want to do an MD-PhD, he reminds me that I'll be in school forever and probably tons of debt
10/16/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: And I've asked him to stop that too
10/16/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: Oh and he'll randomly take my camera and try to take pictures of me
10/16/19, 7:28 PM - Caleb: And he doesn't stop that either
10/16/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm just ranting and stressed at this point
10/16/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Nah I like hearing other people rant usually
10/16/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Weird I know
10/16/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs dramatic and reminds me we all have rough stuff going on
10/16/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: And genuinely he sounds awful
10/16/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Okay tell be about soemthing good that happened today
10/16/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: If you want to
10/16/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Well

10/16/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: And realized it today
10/16/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: And they're people I look forward to seeing at future stuff
10/16/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: So that's pretty nice
10/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs so cool
10/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I kind of didn‚Äôt realize
10/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: But you probably will see many of the same people
10/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs kind of crazy cool
10/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I know my dad always gets breakfast with the davidson psych department at the conference he goes to most years
10/16/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs kind of a community I guess
10/16/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: Aw

10/16/19, 7:37 PM - Caleb: But yeah
10/16/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: It's wild because a lot of them are either post docs or grad students or some sort
10/16/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: It's times like this that I feel like I'm getting old
10/16/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Even though they're not my peers per sey I

10/17/19, 5:35 AM - Caleb: Miss you too
10/17/19, 5:36 AM - Caleb: Hope you're sleeping well and everyone is doing alright
10/17/19, 5:36 AM - Caleb: Updates: apparently I'm now the event photographer
10/17/19, 5:36 AM - Caleb: An organizer asked me to get pictures of an awards ceremony
10/17/19, 5:36 AM - Caleb: And 2) I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING TOMORROW
10/17/19, 5:36 AM - Caleb: Apparently the student board organized a nine hour hike around the bay area
10/17/19, 5:36 AM - Caleb: And it's supposed to be absolutely stunning
10/17/19, 8:56 AM - Caleb: D O N E
10/17/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: Woot
10/17/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Yeehaw
10/17/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Went okay
10/17/19, 9:01 AM - Marianna: Hey I think you‚Äôre talk probably just finished and I wasn‚Äôt there (obviously) but I am so sure it was amazing
10/17/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: We just woke up and chatted with Devansh and robin and Mia and then let Devansh and robin go home
10/17/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna go back to sleep I think
10/17/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: But temporary goodmorning
10/17/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: And the hike sounds phenomenal
10/17/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs super cool about the photographer thing!
10/17/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Oh and good morningish!
10/17/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: How ya feeling
10/17/19, 9:12 AM - Marianna: Like I want to sleep some more
10/17/19, 9:12 AM - Marianna: My stomach actually hurts more than my head
10/17/19, 9:12 AM - Marianna: Which isn‚Äôt usually what happens when I‚Äôm hungover
10/17/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Psst
10/17/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Drink some water
10/17/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: It always helps
10/17/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: Oh that might be a good idea
10/17/19, 9:16 AM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the presentation go!  Did people ask questions!
10/17/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: Once I got into it, all went well
10/17/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: Honestly the worst part about presentations is just the lead up, then it's all fine
10/17/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: I just force myself to smile and it usually works
10/17/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: Fake it till you make it I guess
10/17/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: And yeah people asked questions, but I feel like I didn't totally totally answer their questions
10/17/19, 9:18 AM - Caleb: And a lot of them are radiologists, so they weren't super familiar with the pathology
10/17/19, 9:23 AM - Caleb: Update
10/17/19, 9:23 AM - Caleb: Spyros literally just told an entire workshop that he's using a VPN
10/17/19, 9:23 AM - Caleb: Someone sent a link to his email for a presentation
10/17/19, 9:23 AM - Caleb: And he can't open it
10/17/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: I walked in just as it was happening, then turned 360¬∞ and walked out
10/17/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: Update went back to my workshop and saw the guy after me get murdered by questions
10/17/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: So hey everything went better than expected on my end
10/17/19, 9:24 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a big fan of fake it till you make t
10/17/19, 9:24 AM - Marianna: But hey
10/17/19, 9:24 AM - Marianna: You just did your first conference presentation!!!
10/17/19, 9:24 AM - Marianna: And if it went well, it can only get better with experience!!
10/17/19, 9:24 AM - Marianna: So good job is what I‚Äôm trying to say
10/17/19, 9:25 AM - Marianna: And yeah well what do radiologists know
10/17/19, 9:25 AM - Marianna: (Kidding I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre all great)
10/17/19, 9:25 AM - Marianna: ((The differences in medical fields all kinds of confuse me like what overlaps there are))
10/17/19, 9:25 AM - Marianna: Well is it really a problem he said that?
10/17/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: To spyross thing?
10/17/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: And well hey
10/17/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not to bad
10/17/19, 9:56 AM - Marianna: Poor fellow though
10/17/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt happen to you
10/17/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: I feel like whenever I give presentations I like getting questions afterward
10/17/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: Oh no absolutely no one cared
10/17/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: It was just awkward because he couldn't present
10/17/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: But they figured it out
10/17/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: Pathology is cutting out things and looking at them through a microscope, radiology is Xrays and MRIs and all that good stuff
10/17/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: And HEY how are you!
10/17/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: What are you up to?
10/17/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: This is your short day right?
10/17/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Woah there's a VIP here right now
10/17/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Or about to arrive
10/17/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Sorry just finished with everything, but anyway there's a ton of armed security and monks
10/17/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: It's surreal
10/17/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Update I think it‚Äôs time for me to get out of bed
10/17/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: :(
10/17/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Yes but don‚Äôt radiologists know some stuff about pathology and vice versa?
10/17/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: I have absolutely no class today
10/17/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Theory got canceled
10/17/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Which is why we went hard last night
10/17/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm free all day but I need to fonish the theory homework and study for the Hungarian midterm tomorrow
10/17/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: How do you get to be a vip at a conference?  And how to you know?
10/17/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: MARIONS COMING TO BUDAPEST
10/17/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: not like right now
10/17/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: In a month
10/17/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: And woah
10/17/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Uh monks?
10/17/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: Hellllooo Marianna
10/17/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: How are ya
10/17/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: It's been a wild wild day
10/17/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: How are you
10/17/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: Update it is beautiful outside. I‚Äôm wearing a T-shirt and it‚Äôs still a little warm
10/17/19, 2:10 PM - Marianna: Update #2 there are not one but 2 dogs in the cafe I‚Äôm in
10/17/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: Dorado by The Last Bison

10/17/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: Also I love all of those updates
10/17/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: If you're around I have like 45 minutes to talk before heading out again!
10/17/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: Okay, now to respond to all of that
10/17/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah, all docs know a good bit about the human body
10/17/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: And they're two fields that are fairly closely related with what they do, so they collaborate a lot
10/17/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: And WHAT YOU LUCKY DOG
10/17/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: It was a South Asian religious conference
10/17/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: So I'm guessing it was some prominent religious figure that many people don't like
10/17/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: WOAH NO WAY
10/17/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: I thought she was already coming through? With Margaux?
10/17/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: I'm so happy for you
10/17/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: I'm SO SO happy for you (and the dogs)
10/17/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/17/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Yes I‚Äôm here
10/17/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Just got home from working in the cafe with Devansh
10/17/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: We should do cafe study dates and not just wall study dates if you‚Äôre down
10/17/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Although I‚Äôm not sure how productive that would be
10/17/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm beginning to like the cafe vibe
10/17/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Maybe it‚Äôs just European cafe vibes though
10/17/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: And ah I would hope docs know a little bit about how human bodies work
10/17/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: But okay that makes sense
10/17/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah theory got canceled but he‚Äôs having a makeup session (to study for the midterm) next Tuesday 4-6 which is a little annoying
10/17/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: And wait this was a difference conference from the one you‚Äôre at?
10/17/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: And Margaux is coming this weekend with some cope people
10/17/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Marions coming for 4 whole days in November
10/17/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: And then I‚Äôll see her again the next weekend in Milan
10/17/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: But how was your day!
10/17/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Oh I'm definitely down
10/17/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: But like not nunmit caf√©s
10/17/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Nummit*
10/17/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Darn it, new phone can't deal with Davidson spellings
10/17/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: And my day has been a bit weird
10/17/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Up until the conference ended it was fine
10/17/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: But after it just got weird
10/17/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: We had a drink, chatted about future projects and papers and conferences and stuff
10/17/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: And said bye to some people
10/17/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: Then we decided to go to Louhu, which is the cheap chinese electronics market
10/17/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: So we did, and watched Spyros barter like mad because he learned it in his hometown in Greece
10/17/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: And then after we finished, they were telling us about this legendary spa place in shenzhen
10/17/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: So we decided to go and get massages
10/17/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: I thought it would be quick, but it was minimum of 90 minutes
10/17/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: And it felt really amazing, but now afterwards they basically have a lounge where people to to just kill time
10/17/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: And there are no windows or clocks
10/17/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: And it's giving me a really weird vibe
10/17/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: And tbh I don't like it at all
10/17/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: And I went downstairs to shave a little, came back, and everyone was gone
10/17/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: So I'm just a *tad* panicked right now
10/17/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: I just want to be in my shitty bed right now
10/17/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: I want this adventure to be over
10/17/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: FOUND THEN THANK GOD
10/17/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/17/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Less panicn
10/17/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: But anyway
10/17/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: Massage was fantastic though
10/17/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: By the way, I'm _totally_ gonna get a bottle of baby oil if you want massages next semester
10/17/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Made it so much better
10/17/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: I was trying to remember what she was doing so I could try it, if that's fine with you :))
10/17/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah like new and exciting cafes maybe Charlotte?
10/17/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: And oof I would hate that
10/17/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very scared when I lose my friends
10/17/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: And well I won‚Äôt complain whatever you‚Äôd like to do
10/17/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: But hey at least you got a massage out of it
10/17/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: I know a couple in Charlotte!
10/17/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Sarah and mia are about to go walk around Budapest at night
10/17/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: I miss it
10/17/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: But I guess I‚Äôll just be studying Hungarian
10/17/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: For Christmas last year, we made nick a map of Charlotte with coffee shops in each, and $5 in each coffee shop
10/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: :(
10/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: That was the best
10/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Honestly, thank you for everything
10/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: You're so so sweet and I really miss spending time with you
10/17/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs such a cute idea for him
10/17/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Be a big coffee shop person?
10/17/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: And awww no problem
10/17/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah not gonna lie not having either you or sarah was quite rough over the weekend
10/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Like I consider myself very independent but I was like woah they‚Äôre both gone!
10/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: And now Sarahs kind of gone again because she‚Äôs out with mia rn
10/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm fighting with my 950 word quizlet
10/17/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: But dude shouldn‚Äôt you ya know be asleep
10/17/19, 8:40 PM - Marianna: Are you back home for the night?
10/17/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Oh you don't even know it
10/17/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: It's like part of his personality
10/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah I just got back though
10/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: I'm going on the 9 hour hike tomorrow, and siddhesh asked if he could come
10/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: And I stupidly said yes
10/17/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: It's not my fault he's depressed bc a girl broke his heart and it's scoring sympathy points while he's still an asshole and I don't want to be anywhere near him
10/17/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: But I'd feel bad stranding him in a city where he doesn't know anyone or the language
10/17/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Anyway
10/17/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Miss you
10/17/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
10/17/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: Oh I thought the hike was today but you had you‚Äôre think today so that makes more sense it‚Äôs tomorrow
10/17/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: And I see why you said yes
10/17/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sorry for the miserableness you might have to endure tomorrow for it
10/17/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre a really good person
10/17/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Still a broken heart doesn‚Äôt entitle you to making other miserable I have had to deal with a few people who do that and it‚Äôs hard to balance letting them get over it and letting them get away with murder
10/17/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: I still have no doubt it will be fun
10/17/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs a hike
10/17/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Around a cool new place
10/17/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Sounds like just your element
10/17/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: But goodnight!

10/18/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: Hike was great
10/18/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: A little more urban than I was hoping, but still really really fun
10/18/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/18/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: I'll send more pictures when I have internet again on Sunday morning
10/18/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: But basically we hiked/walked along the ridge between Hong Kong and China
10/18/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: And a lot of it was paved or had roads next to it or were through towns
10/18/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: OH OH OH
10/18/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: AND
10/18/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: BEACHES
10/18/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: We found a beach and all hung out for like an hour and ate lunch
10/18/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: We also went swimming, the girls brought swim suits but the guys didn't so we just kinda did it the French way and went in with underwear
10/18/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: The south China sea is so nice, I couldn't believe it
10/18/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: And the weather was like low 80s all day
10/18/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: So it was absolutely gorgeous
10/18/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: How are you?
10/18/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Oh that sounds so nice
10/18/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: I wasn‚Äôt aware that was the french way
10/18/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: I thought the French way was a nude way
10/18/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: And wow that sounds wonderful
10/18/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs _only_ like 70s here this week
10/18/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good gotta go to comp bio
10/18/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: I just feel asleep and it was wonderful
10/18/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Marianna
10/18/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: How are you
10/18/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm jealous
10/18/19, 11:42 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good
10/18/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: A little stressed for Hungarian
10/18/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: But I think I know enough to wing it
10/18/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: Very stressed at the prospect of my midterms next week
10/18/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: Excited that it‚Äôs Friday
10/18/19, 11:43 AM - Marianna: How are you?
10/18/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Well
10/18/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: I only call it the "French way" because it's what my French friend did
10/18/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: But in hindsight, it was probably out of consideration for the rest of us
10/18/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: Oooohhhh weeellll
10/18/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: I'm also excited it's Friday
10/18/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: I'm ready to go home
10/18/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: It's been almost 3 weeks
10/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Or just over 2 really
10/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Oh and sorry for the delay in response, I totally fell asleep again
10/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: And HEY you're great and you got this
10/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: I fully believe in you, you seem to enjoy learning and practicing it
10/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Or if nothing else, telling me about it
10/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: You're gonna nail this
10/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: (But it's 100% okay if you don't)
10/18/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Update my head hurts and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm getting sick or I‚Äôm stressed
10/18/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Totally zoned out in comp bio today
10/18/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: But I did apply to a job so at least I was productive
10/18/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: And no probelm
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm always lonely when you don‚Äôt respond but I don‚Äôt get mad
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: I am glad to hear you got sleep
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Also mia will NOT shut up
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Whatever
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: :(
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Maybe that‚Äôs why my head hurt
10/18/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Might not be why, but definitely won't help
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry, I wish I could give you a hug right now
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: I think I will be fine for Hungarian I just get SO worked up for tests especially ones that are not takehomes
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: I miss my takehomes
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: ME
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: TOO
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: But I also get worked up for those
10/18/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And then I really don't want to take them, which isn't good because it's an actual option then
10/18/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Oh good point
10/18/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: But lowkey being able to have snacks and piglet and sometimes audrey kept me calm for those tests
10/18/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: What does the rest of your day look like?
10/18/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: I might just not do anything
10/18/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: I'm super tired
10/18/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: I need to figure out how to check into my flight
10/18/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: Or maybe I'll just go to the mall next door
10/18/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: Idk

10/18/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: (okay _mildly_ fun fact, fine)
10/18/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: I know I got something wrong because Hans was talking about it but I‚Äôm okay I think I did pretty well overall
10/18/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Still have a headache though
10/18/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Was he related to the Gillespie
10/18/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Proooobably not
10/18/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: Or maybe
10/18/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Or is the mildly fun fact that he is now a professional bridge player
10/18/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: Yeah thats just the fun fact
10/18/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: The bridge thing

10/18/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Also yeah I've played bridge, and I only kinda sorta felt like a 70 year old
10/18/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even know what bridge looks like
10/18/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: And don‚Äôt you dare send a google image of a bridge
10/18/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: I just mean I don‚Äôt know what the games like
10/18/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna
10/18/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: But I do associate it with old people

10/20/19, 7:09 AM - Marianna: Oof
10/20/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs been about 24 hours since I heard from you for sure
10/20/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôve been in the air a bunch
10/20/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: Oh my bed and pig are so comfortable
10/20/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: I made my bed for the first time since you getting here yesterday
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: And Chinese airports have awful wifi
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: Since it's super totalitarian across the board
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: You need personally identifying information to log onto their wifi
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: Such as passport numbers and everything
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: what
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: And I was like yeah no thanks
10/20/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: Whack
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: And Pablo was saying it didn't even work
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: So that's even more whack
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: Oh man
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: Pablo
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: What a dude
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Marianna: I mean it probably lets them spy on you and be able to tie it more closely to you
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: I mean
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Marianna: And yeah!  I‚Äôm glad you made a friend
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: Pretty much
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Marianna: I am so confused by your ability to do that
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: Gotta say, China? Not a huge fan
10/20/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: My ability to do what
10/20/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: Well at least now you know
10/20/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: Meet people while traveling and like make a friend out of it
10/20/19, 7:14 AM - Caleb: Ah
10/20/19, 7:14 AM - Caleb: Yeah I guess I tend to do that, don't I
10/20/19, 7:14 AM - Marianna: Like I consider myself so extraverted but there is no way I‚Äôd ever be able to do this
10/20/19, 7:14 AM - Caleb: Also I feel like I should respond to all those texts you sent at some point
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Marianna: Eh I don‚Äôt even remember all of what o sent
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Caleb: (thanks for sending them by the way, I always love getting those when I wake up or in times like this)
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Caleb: Oh
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Caleb: Oh boy
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Marianna: No no I‚Äôm fine
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Marianna: It was just a long period of time when I‚Äôd randomly text you
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Marianna: But my day was pretty boring yesterday for the most part
10/20/19, 7:15 AM - Marianna: But man I really need to study for like all my midterms today
10/20/19, 7:16 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm sorry to leave you like this but I need to sleep a little more so I will be productive LATER today. Goodnight part 2 and good luck getting home!
10/20/19, 7:16 AM - Caleb: Okay! Goodnight
10/20/19, 7:16 AM - Caleb: Thanks for chatting for a bit
10/20/19, 7:17 AM - Caleb: Also I'm super super proud of you for drinking water
10/20/19, 7:17 AM - Caleb: Go you :)
10/20/19, 7:19 AM - Caleb: Ah dang
10/20/19, 7:20 AM - Caleb: I got off the plane and was super excited because I felt like I was going to see you again
10/20/19, 7:20 AM - Caleb: Because the last couple times I've been at the airport, that's why it's been
10/20/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: Hey honestly, I'm just happy enough to be in the time zone as you now
10/20/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: AH SHIT THERE WAS JUST A CALL FOR PASSENGERS TO BUDAPEST
10/20/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: Rats
10/20/19, 7:22 AM - Caleb: Yeah they're really rubbing it in
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: Anyway, now to respond to the wall of texts because I'm waiting in customs
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: First off, I'm also Dutch as Fuck
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: So it's very fitting, good stuff
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: Second, THE COFFEE SHOP DOOOOOG
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: That makes me so happy
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: Oh my gosh I can see it now
10/20/19, 7:27 AM - Caleb: Its a dog with a job
10/20/19, 7:28 AM - Caleb: Good boy/girl
10/20/19, 7:28 AM - Caleb: Good puppo
10/20/19, 7:28 AM - Caleb: Puppo is gender neutral
10/20/19, 7:29 AM - Caleb: Also I'm super happy for you about the baths, but also sad because I wanted to do the baths, and OH MY GOSH your hair was probably so curly
10/20/19, 7:30 AM - Caleb: But also jokes on you because I always love your hair
10/20/19, 7:31 AM - Caleb: And when you wake up, I'm gonna need some elaboration everything from the "Drunk crying" text to the "men are pigs" text
10/20/19, 7:31 AM - Caleb: Because those are two texts that aren't very comfy on their own, but especially not together
10/20/19, 7:32 AM - Caleb: Is everything alright? What's up?
10/20/19, 8:01 AM - Caleb: Oh man after metro controls in like 4 cities within two weeks, gotta say I'm a fan of Copenhagen's
10/20/19, 9:43 AM - Caleb: Update
10/20/19, 9:43 AM - Caleb: I shaved
10/20/19, 9:43 AM - Caleb: And I REALLY like the way it looks
10/20/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: I trimmed it down, and with short hair I finally think it looks good
10/20/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Amazing
10/20/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: I don't feel 12
10/20/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: It's a miracle
10/20/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: Hallo
10/20/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: Hallo fron Danmark
10/20/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: I'm not doing the special characters sorry
10/20/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: And please speak quietly as to not upset my headache
10/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: No no I don‚Äôt need special Schaffer‚Äôs
10/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Characyers**
10/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Oh you know what I mean
10/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Glad you‚Äôre back in denmark
10/20/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Really want wait to hear and see more from your trip
10/20/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay only like a month and then we‚Äôll see each other as long as we plan that kinda soon idk if tickets have gone up or anything
10/20/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: I know!  I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt get to!  But you didn‚Äôt have a suit and Idk where to get one
10/20/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: But they were cool
10/20/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send photos today
10/20/19, 10:06 AM - Marianna: But also I know myself and I would have done too much pda in that pool with ya and it might have been uncomfy for others
10/20/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: It was and still kind of is very ringlet -y
10/20/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: And salty or mineraly or whatever was in the ayer
10/20/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: Water
10/20/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: Pretty sure it was just minerals
10/20/19, 10:08 AM - Marianna: You shaved!
10/20/19, 10:08 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm intrigued
10/20/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: aHA the real reason is out
10/20/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: I'm sure we could have refrained
10/20/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: But eh it's fine, maybe I'll be in Budapest again someday
10/20/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: And yep! There was no real reason besides I thought it looked a little too shaggy
10/20/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: Maybe I'll send a picture later, but I need to run some errands first
10/20/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: Also am I getting no elaboration on the crying and other stuff last night? You totally don't need to if you don't want to, but I just want to make sure everything's okay
10/20/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: Yeah well I kinda wish I had taken you there but oh well
10/20/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôll just have to come back
10/20/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: I plan on definitely coming back eventually (both to the baths probably this semester and Budapest). Low key hope Joey decides to go abroad here so I can visit
10/20/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: And well the crying was because I was reallllllly missing davidson like with Margaux and Evan is here and we ran into julia and erin
10/20/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: Gotta love watching the ra from one floor down swasted
10/20/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: And men are just pigs and the men at instant are creepy and seem to think they can do whatever and it‚Äôs fine
10/20/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: But we‚Äôre all good
10/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Okay
10/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: I'm glad to hear that
10/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Well except for the whole creepy men thing, that's never a good time
10/20/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: I hope everyone was OK though
10/20/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: And yeah I hope I can come back someday, it'll just be a challenge finding people to go with because it's kind of a Dae trip from Davidson
10/20/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: But hey maybe like senior year I could convince friends to come with me for like spring break or something
10/20/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: Anyway, enough with the "woulda shoulda coulda"
10/20/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: How are you!
10/20/19, 10:45 AM - Marianna: Dae trip?
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a long way away for even a week in the middle of school
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: definitely doable senior year though I guess because everyone will probably be very done with school
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: Good!
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: Still in bed
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna get up at 11
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: And shower
10/20/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: And then study
10/20/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: Long*
10/20/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: I have zero idea how that turned into Daes
10/20/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: Hey but I can blame jetlag again so that's cool
10/20/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: No you want just blame jet lag
10/20/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: You overused your jet lag typing excuses in August
10/20/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre in the red on jet lag excuse balance
10/20/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: Sorry
10/20/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: Woah it feels so long ago that you first got to denmark
10/20/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: Gosh darn it
10/20/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: Also my mind is still working in Chinese
10/20/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: Which isn't great
10/20/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: Its like my default "foreign language response" flipped from Danish to Chinese because I'm way more comfortable with it
10/20/19, 10:54 AM - Caleb: Also yeah, it's been a while
10/20/19, 10:54 AM - Caleb: But you've been in Budapest longer
10/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah
10/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: That makes sense though
10/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Did you speak mostly Chinese while there or also in English to people?
10/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: And nope!  I‚Äôve been in Europe longer but you got to denmark before I got to Hungary
10/20/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: Mostly Chinese
10/20/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: There was a bit of English too, but that was mostly during the conference
10/20/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: If I went anywhere or did anything, I'd either be trying to figure things out myself, or having to translate for people
10/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Which I've gotten surprisingly good at
10/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: It's hard when LITERALLY no one there spoke English
10/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Most places at least having English movies or TV or Netflix, but since China is so blocked off, they didn't even have that
10/20/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Oh man I'm excited to tell you about all of this when we call
10/20/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Tonight might work, but I have to study a good bit over the next 3 days
10/20/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: Do people learn English in China?  I thought it was a still pretty universal second language
10/20/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: and yeah tonight might work for me as well
10/20/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: I also have to FaceTime my parents
10/20/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: And do that studying thing
10/20/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: No, no they don't
10/20/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: A lot of the population doesn't speak a single word
10/20/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: It's super super shutoff, even in the second (I think) most populous city in China
10/20/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Michel and I were literally the translators the whole week
10/20/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: And some people could speak English, but they were the few who worked in areas where tons of foreigners were
10/20/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Like the electronics market
10/20/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: But other than that, China is so huge and people rarely leave, that no one really feels the need or even has the opportunity to learn English
10/20/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: And I'm sure there's also some element of resting westernization there
10/20/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: Also, hey, you want some pictures?
10/20/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: Woah that‚Äôs so crazy
10/20/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never been somewhere like that
10/20/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: Sure I‚Äôm places where they don‚Äôt speak it
10/20/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: But like it‚Äôs individuals who don‚Äôt
10/20/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: Not like a system that doesn‚Äôt really support it
10/20/19, 11:18 AM - Marianna: Yes!  And after you send yours, do you want some from me from Bratislava and this weekend?
10/20/19, 11:20 AM - Caleb: Well I mean it might make me incredibly jealous but absolutely :D
10/20/19, 11:20 AM - Marianna: What!  Why!
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Sorry I'm on my laptop now, so I gotta kick it like 2011 style instead of using emojis
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre photos are def cooler
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Ha
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Well Marianna
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: One reason and one reason only:
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: I wish I was hanging with you
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: I did not get WhatsApp for my laptop
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Sorry 'boot that
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Ah
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Well
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Sorry boot that too
10/20/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Oh I use the web client sometimes
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Marianna: But you still had the cooler weekend
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: Its just easier to drag and drdop photos on it
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm getting up I‚Äôll be back
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: Well, weekend? Probably not
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: My weekend was pretty much just flying
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: Except for Friday night
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: ANYWAY
10/20/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: I'll stop being cheesy I promise
10/20/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: Those were right outside my AirBnB
10/20/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: The first one is the sign on top of a mall, its just cool lookoing
10/20/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: The second was the time I accidentally stumbled into Paris, obviously
10/20/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: Jk it was a place called "Window of the World", which I'll tell you more about later
10/20/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: Basically its China recreating a bunch of monuments from around the world, putting them in a little park, and then having a sign out front that says "Welcome to Our World"
10/20/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: And you pay to go in and look around at a bunch of fake monuments
10/20/19, 11:25 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/20/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: It was kind of eerie, I have more pictures of it later

10/20/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: These were just in the middle of the city, all right next to each other
10/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: China, or at least Shenzhen, is ALL about appearances
10/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: So they have some really really really cool looking buildings, but once you walk around the facade you can tell its all fake
10/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: And they're all localized in a few very specific parts of town where tourists can go
10/20/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/20/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: Not sure if this guy is homeless or not, but he's sleeping in the middle of the day on a bench outside a SUPER fancy building

10/20/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: He was super happy, but I guess they just don't see a lot of westerners, especially not ones with blue eyes
10/20/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: I'll tell you about all the staring later
10/20/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: I looked like shipping containers
10/20/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Not very nice, and was right behind a GIANT tower that was golden
10/20/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: Its a super interesting vibe
10/20/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: People just hang out, grab chairs, sit outside, buy whatever, smoke, drink, and just generally hang here for a good time
10/20/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Its not specifically like a "go and eat here" place, its like "go kill time here"
10/20/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: I have more pictures later

10/20/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: On the other side of that street, theres a bunch of guys around a griddle cooking clams for the restaurant inside
10/20/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: And to the left of that picture, theres a bathroom that was literally just a hole in a ground and a sink which dumped onto the floor. If I stood up straight, I hit my head on the ceiling.

10/20/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: Its a rooftop club/bar that miiiiight have been a strip club, and we found a bachelorette/birthday party
10/20/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: We just wanted another drink and stumbled across it
10/20/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: There was no one stripping when we walked in, but it definitely had the vibe
10/20/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: And thats about it for the first day
10/20/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: I'll wait until you're back so I don't absolutely flood you
10/20/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm back
10/20/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre all so great
10/20/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: China has such a weird vibe
10/20/19, 12:13 PM - Marianna: Like the streets are sooooo different than what I‚Äôm used to
10/20/19, 12:14 PM - Marianna: Annoyed face is great
10/20/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: Boo siddhesh
10/20/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: Okay you want mine?  Or you got more for me?
10/20/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: Oh that was literally the first day
10/20/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: I don't want to overwhelm you though
10/20/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: I took about 1400 pics I think?
10/20/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: A lot of them are of siddhesh or Ujjwell though
10/20/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: And one of Margaux‚Äôs friends has your filters and shirt!  She lives across from you in nimbus
10/20/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: They were kinda acting like camera hungry children and would just go "Caleb click a good picture of me"
10/20/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Siddhesh would just tell me to do it, at least Ujjwell would ask
10/20/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: And sweet! Thanks
10/20/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Do you know her name?
10/20/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: Erika?
10/20/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: Ariel!
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: And hey I hate to point it out but that‚Äôs kind of the cost of being a good photographer and carrying your camera around
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: They shouldn‚Äôt take advantage of it
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Yeah I don't mind taking pictures of people
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Actually I really enjoy it
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: But I would use the line ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt have that many photos left on my sd card so I want to save them for things I see not just you guys
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: If you want to NOT have to take a photo of soemthing or someone
10/20/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: Street photography and portraits are turning into my favorite type I think
10/20/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: But it just bothers me when people expect or demand something of me
10/20/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Like, come on, at least say please
10/20/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Or at least give me a fully formed sentence
10/20/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Don't just say "Caleb, pictures."
10/20/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: Anyway I'll stop complaining
10/20/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: I want to see pictures of your weekend!
10/20/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: Yeah we‚Äôve established he‚Äôs not a great person but hey you don‚Äôt have to see him for like almost a year if not more at this point
10/20/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry you had to travel and live with him though
10/20/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/20/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: If I was any less determined to have a good time, he could have easily ruined my time
10/20/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: But hey
10/20/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: I had a blast for the most part

10/20/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Devanshs face was the best
10/20/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Nope
10/20/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Now cursed
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: New contact
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: Serry
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: No no please I‚Äôm begging you
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Anything else
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: Gotta say though
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Please
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: That looks like a fun weekend
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: Very... Pastel?
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: I'm noticing a color scheme
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: I like it a lot
10/20/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: The baths look super super fun too
10/20/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: Yeah it was a nice weekend
10/20/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: Both are
10/20/19, 12:44 PM - Marianna: Were**
10/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Also
10/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Devansh looks like he's super high
10/20/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: If I didn't know what a palinka bottle looked like, I could swear that was a bong
10/20/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: He has cake in his mouth
10/20/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a good point though
10/20/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: I will make sure that photo gets no where
10/20/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: Hmmmm
10/20/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: With great power comes great misuse, that's the saying right?
10/20/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure what you mean
10/20/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not the saying but who is it applicable too?
10/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Uh
10/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Meeee?
10/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Don't worry
10/20/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: But you wouldn‚Äôt :(
10/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Your stoner secret is safe with me
10/20/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Update
10/20/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Just saw Liddy Malone
10/20/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: I've been gone two weeks and she's the first Davidson person I saw
10/20/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: (besides you and Sarah)
10/20/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: It was weird
10/20/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: This whole time has been just weird transitions and different people
10/20/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: It's like I can't gage where I am or who I'm with
10/20/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: The world is very, idk, floaty?
10/20/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: That probably doesn't make sense
10/20/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: I feel like I have cultural whiplash
10/20/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Or maybe more than just cultural
10/20/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: I totally see how you could feel that
10/20/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt totally understand what you mean by floaty but okay I‚Äôll take your word
10/20/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: I was thinking the other day like how weird is it gonna be for us to get back to the states
10/20/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Okay I think the floaty-ness is ACTUALLY the jet lag
10/20/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: I'm just out of it, like nothing registers until after it happens
10/20/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: But yeah, I totally get why people who go abroad get the rep of talking about how it "changed their life"
10/20/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: I'm scared ill be obnoxious about it, but like gosh darn it's gonna be weird being back.
10/20/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Everyone speaks English as their primary language? Things are in dollars? We can easily drive?
10/20/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Like what?
10/20/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: Also, today is just peak hygge. I just having shaved, exfoliated my face, moisturized, got more hair cream, lip balm, and am just lounging drinking tea and eating danish chocolate
10/20/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: This is the life
10/20/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: How much sleep did you get during the trip?  Because you basically lost a night fo sleep while on the plane
10/20/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be like it changed my life because i feel like it hasn‚Äôt
10/20/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: I love it here but I‚Äôm still me like I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve changed
10/20/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll miss it and talk a lot about how I miss it for sure
10/20/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: And oooooh I‚Äôm jealous
10/20/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: Please send some of that vibe this way
10/20/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm hungover studying
10/20/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: Not hygge
10/20/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: But I do have the windows open because it‚Äôs literally 76 outside ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: HA
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: I have you beat weather wise
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: Tea also sounds really nice right now
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: WHAT
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: no way
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt believe this
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: 56
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Which isn't warm
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: But gosh darn
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Crack out the sweaters and it's _perfect_
10/20/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: It was mid 80s in shenzhen so this is exactly what I need
10/20/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: But hey have some good hygge vibes
10/20/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: Getting back made me realize how much I love this place
10/20/19, 1:42 PM - Caleb: I think we both ended up exactly where we needed to be Marianna
10/20/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: Yeah I can appreciate sweater weather but it feels so nice right now I wouldn‚Äôt want anything else today
10/20/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: Sweaters can come out in a little bit
10/20/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: I think most of our fall break trip is gonna be cold
10/20/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: Are you in London the week I have fall break?
10/20/19, 1:58 PM - Marianna: And yay I think so too I think it‚Äôs good
10/20/19, 1:58 PM - Marianna: Who‚Äôd a thought
10/20/19, 1:58 PM - Marianna: Well maybe we‚Äôre also the kind of people who are pretty adaptable and make a home where we‚Äôre put in the world
10/20/19, 1:59 PM - Caleb: Oh man, that last thing reminds me of what my mom used to say to me when I was looking at colleges
10/20/19, 1:59 PM - Marianna: Margaux saw my photo wall and she was like THE PHOTO WALL MADE IT TO BUDAPEST
10/20/19, 1:59 PM - Caleb: I was so stressed about finding JUST the right one, that she just started telling me that it's not going to end up mattering too much where I go
10/20/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: I'm the type of person that will be happy and do well anywhere
10/20/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: So yeah, I guess you're right
10/20/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: But also I do feel like I found the perfect place for me at Davidson
10/20/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: Who knows though, maybe I would have said that about somewhere else too
10/20/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm very happy I‚Äôm at davidson
10/20/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: I think I could have been good anywhere
10/20/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: But I think I‚Äôm best at davidson
10/20/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Aaaand I just bumped into Josh Yoon
10/20/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: And we both talked about how much we like it here but would be okay going back to Davidson
10/20/19, 2:09 PM - Caleb: I'm sensing a theme here
10/20/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: Margaux says she doesn‚Äôt miss it
10/20/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: Says she misses the people
10/20/19, 2:29 PM - Marianna: But not being there
10/20/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Oh boy
10/20/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Now I'm hanging out with  Hannah, and she's talking about her two weeks
10/20/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: After getting dumped, she's getting involved with a flatmate
10/20/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: And I'm tryna give advice
10/20/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: This is m e s s y
10/20/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: But I think it'll be okay
10/20/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: Oooh
10/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Yeah wait you haven‚Äôt seen any of your friends in two weeks
10/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: And well is that one way to get around the ‚Äúno overnight guests‚Äù rule?
10/20/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Marianna
10/20/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: My flat is LITERALLY the only one that somehow cares about that
10/20/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: but yeah theres a lot of life updates going on here
10/20/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: You know the gif where Donald Glover walks into the apartment with pizza and everything is on fire
10/20/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: Because thats how I feel right now

10/21/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: It's gonna be over one way or another, but how it goes is up to you
10/21/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: Okay but it‚Äôs exceptionally update
10/21/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: Upbeat
10/21/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: And i don‚Äôt entirely believe you
10/21/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: And uh caleb soemtimes blood stops bleeding for a very bar reason
10/21/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: Bad**
10/21/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: I cannot type apparently
10/21/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: Oof
10/21/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I mean if that's how you think of me then okay
10/21/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: But it's not me I promise
10/21/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: Oh geez is that how you actually think of me
10/21/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: And yeah that's sort of the point of it
10/21/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: It was always a little morbid but oh well
10/21/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: I feel like I don‚Äôt know your music taste entirely yet
10/21/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôll have to dj sometime
10/21/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: That's a bold request
10/21/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: You sure you're up for that?
10/21/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Now that I think about it, I feel like every time I've played music for you, I guess I've tailored it at least _a little_ towards what you would enjoy
10/21/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: I feel like all the music you send me is music I‚Äôd like and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actually your music
10/21/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: YEAH!
10/21/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: Not that I complain
10/21/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: But I also feel like I‚Äôm not sending you stuff that you‚Äôll like it‚Äôs like stuff I‚Äôll like so I need to know what you like so I can send ya stuff
10/21/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: I like sending people songs
10/21/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: But anyway how has your day been
10/21/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: Well
10/21/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: Exciting
10/21/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: My days been uneventful until 1, and then I ran into Woo and all the excitement started
10/21/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: It's been fun telling people about China
10/21/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: And also Woo about all the nuts research
10/21/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: And then my med ethics professor just talked to me for the first 15 minutes of class and we had a really good discussion about tons of stuff
10/21/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: And the class is group work for a debate later, but since I've been gone, I'm gonna be the moderator with Kathryn
10/21/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: Also that's good, I really like your taste in music
10/21/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: I'll need some convincing to show you everything I listen to
10/21/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: It might be a "better in person" deal.
10/21/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Then I can explain what I like about it instead of you being really confused
10/21/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: I can share the joy or something
10/21/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/21/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOD
10/21/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: THEY GOT SULLIVANED
10/21/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: But I am totally for having you share music and it can wait for when we‚Äôre in person
10/21/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: I feel bad for them
10/21/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: And yay!  Hey!  Do I get to hear about China!  Are you free tonight!
10/21/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: And hey look at you lucking out and not having to do a debate
10/21/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: I like to debate but not for class
10/21/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: Maybe you like it for class too
10/21/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh
10/21/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Can I send that screenshot to some of my close friends
10/21/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Lee, Carl, and those guys
10/21/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: It's totally cool if not
10/21/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Also, can we actually call tomorrow? I have two midterms that I'm grossly underprepared for and one is tomorrow
10/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: I just took out our chat name
10/21/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: And I'd rather call when I don't have anything on my back so I don't feel like I have anything else
10/21/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I totally understand!  I have no class Wednesday so Tuesday night works for me
10/21/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Coolio
10/21/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Me too
10/21/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: So that's absolutely perfect
10/21/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: _ill pencil you in_
10/21/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: :)))
10/21/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: And this part is fun because I basically get to just poke holes in arguments while supporting none of my own
10/21/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Which I'm a fan of
10/21/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: Also I'm gonna need to know DETAILS about them getting Sullivaned
10/21/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: I'm so so so curious
10/21/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: OOOOH that does sound fun
10/21/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: And thank you for penciling ne in
10/21/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Means a lot
10/21/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôve gotten a few more details I‚Äôll tell ya over the phone
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: DOOOOONE
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: With one
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: I think it went well
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: I got my other one back and it was pretty good
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: So I'm happy
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: Also, it's now dark and I'm just leaving
10/21/19, 6:32 PM - Caleb: Can't say I'm super happy about thar
10/21/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: Also now all my friends are talking about times they got Sullivaned
10/21/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: If it wasn't snapchat I'd send them to you
10/21/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll copy and paste
10/21/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/1HimGOB6BjOaCQYMIF1xtU?si=7ZiTIpskSNip4ryVpWiFNQ
10/21/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm having a miserable time
10/21/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll listen to the song
10/21/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm eating dinner now
10/21/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: But I have so much to do
10/21/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: :(((
10/21/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: What do you have?
10/21/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: Mobile is kicking my ass
10/21/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt figure something else out
10/21/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: YOU GOT THIS
10/21/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Is there any way I can help? You want to call and rubber duck on me?
10/21/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think so
10/21/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm taking a break
10/21/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: And then I‚Äôll go back to work
10/21/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Okay well you got this
10/21/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: ... Driiiiink some water?
10/21/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: Whyyyyy
10/21/19, 8:15 PM - Caleb: Uh
10/21/19, 8:16 PM - Caleb: It's pretty much the only advice I'm qualified to give
10/21/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/21/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs up with you tonight?  Just studying?
10/21/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: You know what I do when I'm stressed and it's something like this?
10/21/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: I shower
10/21/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: I shower and just think about life
10/21/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: And what I need to do
10/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: And what I did to get me here
10/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: And what I need to avoid to not be here again
10/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: And how I'm probably going to do it ahaon
10/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: Again*
10/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: And then I slowly turn the water colder until I can't stand it, and then I get out
10/21/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: And we'll, tomorrow I have a midterm in mythology
10/21/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: It's my only test in this class
10/21/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: I'm quite worried
10/21/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: ... And gonna shower soon
10/21/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Ah can I join you
10/21/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Sounds much more fun than doing my mobile and my crypto
10/21/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm still watching Jane the virgin
10/21/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: No pressure this stuff is due at midnight
10/21/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Join me in what, the cramming or the shower
10/21/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Because exactly one of those things sounds fun
10/21/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Okay actually the material is kinda fun
10/21/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: But not under a high stress situation
10/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Also uhhhhh I don't want to pressure you but shouldn't you be working then
10/21/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Both?
10/21/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Cramming in the shower?
10/21/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: You do have a tiny shower
10/21/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm just frustrated because I think I have the right logic but I‚Äôm not calling and casting the data right
10/21/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so frustrating because like 60% of it works but the stuff that doesn‚Äôt crashes the app which is no good
10/21/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/21/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: Now I'm actually recommending a shower
10/21/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: It's a great way to just reset
10/21/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: I kind of use it as a hallmark to be like "okay, I need to take a break, have a cup of tea, shower, and then I'll do X Y and Z"
10/21/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: And then you can put the face down straight after you finish
10/21/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: What's the app?
10/21/19, 8:50 PM - Caleb: Also, apparently Lee had already read the Saga of Patrick the Tripping
10/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna need your account, but also yeah from what I've heard, that sounds on brand
10/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Oh my god it was so simple
10/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: Alternatively I‚Äôm dumb
10/21/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: You really can‚Äôt do 20 - ‚Äú$34‚Äù
10/21/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: YAY
10/21/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: It's all good though right
10/21/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: That's the nice thing about stupid mistakes
10/21/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: IT WOKEED
10/21/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: I FIXED BOTH BUGS
10/21/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: YEEEEEES
10/21/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: HEYYYYY
10/21/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: GO YOU
10/21/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Update:
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I blame big bootie
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Have you heard of big bootie
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: ü¶Äü¶Ä Has been talking about all the times we've been Sullivaned
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Actually I‚Äôm gonna guess sarah brought it up at some point
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: And no, I can't say I have
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Oh!
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: We will have to fix that
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: It makes me smart
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Like sometimes I just need to put it on to do my homework right
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: "Saga of P√¶√æric the Dr≈ìling" - Carl
10/21/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Also apparently Maggie and Lee are friends
10/21/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: are they both on the davidson in France program
10/21/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: ALSO ANOTHER GOOD NEWS
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: I think so
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: RLO SAID THEY COULD PROBAVLY MAKE IT WORK
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: oh that‚Äôs cool
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: He said Maggie showed him the Patrick stuff on her phone
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: I have literally not talked to maggie since the spring
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: Ha!
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: Everyone loves talking about how crazy he is
10/21/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Which means she knows "Max is a üêé-jerker"
10/21/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: I know it's a deer but I couldn't find the emoji
10/21/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Woah, that's weird
10/21/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: I thought you guys were pretty close
10/21/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Also YAAAAAAYY
10/21/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: Toldya
10/21/19, 9:08 PM - Caleb: I should probabaly email Hannah and check if I have a single
10/21/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: Have you heard the deer jerker story?
10/21/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: That max jerked off a deer?
10/21/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: Yes
10/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Yeah but I forget like 80% of the context
10/21/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: Work or something?
10/21/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Yeah work
10/21/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Animal sanctuary
10/21/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Paralyzed baby deer needed to pee and that was the only way
10/21/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Good kid max rollfinke
10/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: I'm trying to imagine how that conversation went with his boss
10/21/19, 9:31 PM - Caleb: Probably pretty well
10/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Honestly yeah
10/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs max
10/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Hi
10/21/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: I love my crypto class
10/21/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: When I was looking at abroad stuff it was one of the reasons I wanted to go to ait
10/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Hi
10/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: I feel like I'm picking up on sarcasm here
10/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: But if not
10/21/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Im super happy for you
10/21/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Nono
10/21/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Can be very frustrating but when I get it ITS SO COOL
10/21/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: What are you working on now?
10/21/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/21/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: I am not very good at it like it doesn‚Äôt come intuitively
10/21/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: But LOOK HOW PRETTY
10/21/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: I had to ask him about it today before class though
10/21/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: He was more than happy to help so I‚Äôm glad I did
10/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: WOAH
10/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: That's so cool
10/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: I'm a tad jealous
10/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: I wish I was taking a class that cool
10/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: That's the issue though, there are too many things I love doing
10/21/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: But I gotta go for depth, not breadth
10/21/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you're enjoying your classes though, I'm always super impressed by you :)
10/21/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Which is a long way of saying I can't wait to have you show me everything and explain it to me next semester
10/21/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: I'm boutta vicariously learn the hell out of this
10/21/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/21/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll do my best to explain it to you
10/21/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: I can promise cool demos
10/21/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve learned how to break a lot of encryption stuff
10/21/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Not sure I can explain how to but I can show how to
10/21/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: And no no I‚Äôm not the impressive one
10/21/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: And well darn we‚Äôve been caught sorry this isn‚Äôt gonna work anymore
10/21/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: (Kidding)
10/21/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: That seems like the unprompted question asking stuff my mom would do
10/21/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: Also I can‚Äôt believe you type OK
10/21/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: WOAH hang on there buck
10/21/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: Bucko
10/21/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: I type "ok"
10/21/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: And then autocorrect takes over
10/21/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: Sick broski
10/21/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: That actually does sound cool though
10/21/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: Sorry we didn't use your AES program when I was in China
10/21/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: It would have been fun, but also I kinda just didn't want to look like a spy and get detained and "interrogated"
10/21/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/21/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: And there's your followup
10/21/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: (My dad likes to tease me pretty hard about it, don't read too much into me asking why)
10/21/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Still
10/21/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: The proper form is
10/21/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Wait what
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Will not budge here
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Oh no
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: But you can have your preference
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: And it will all be okay
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Uh ok then
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Ok?
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Actually
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: I am not going to respond to that with an okay
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Now that I think about it
10/21/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not gonna let you set that up
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I whip out "okay" in certain contexts
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Yes I‚Äôm glad you did not get interrogated
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: I use it as the "everything is going to be okay"
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs valid
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Caleb: Or synonymous with "is or will be fine"
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: And oh I‚Äôm sure your dad was shocked I mean you?  A gorlfriend?
10/21/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Every context is okay with me
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Ok just seems curt
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: But if it's an acknowledgement of "got it", it's ok
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Not that I read yours like that
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want people to think that from me
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Okaaaay
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Oooookay
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Also submitted everything due at midnight!
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Okaaaaayyy then
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: HOORAY
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Means bedtime soonish
10/21/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: And yeah I know right
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: What a loser, the world is upside down
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Pigs are flying
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Hell is frozen over
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: I have to take a coding test for a application and I should do it ASAP but MIDTERMS
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: did you just call your girlfriend a loser
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: But hey he's apparently got good luck so
10/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: WAIT
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: No
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: The guy
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: The guy is
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: That was the joke
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: Oh it‚Äôs fine
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: ... I think that was your joke actually
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: Hey wait a second
10/21/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: Not OK
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: She knows she ain‚Äôt a loser
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: The poor chap isn‚Äôt either
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Or maybe they both are
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Nah
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Nah we‚Äôll not think about that option
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: I'd consider us in like top 5% of coolness
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: üëä
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: That was me sending a fist bump
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: I thought you were beating me up
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: I was like
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Damn
10/21/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Uncalled for
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: NO THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR CLALING ME A LOSER
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: ha kidding
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Oh I should have gone for 2 thumbs up
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: üëçüëç
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Better
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: They are so cool
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: üòé
10/21/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: üòéüòéüòé
10/21/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: But yeah
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Considering we both have friends, did sports, get good grades, are pretty socially active and well liked, have interesting hobbies, and take care of ourselves
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: I'd rank us pretty cool
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Not that I'm biased
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: No man I‚Äôm pretty secure in the fact that I never have been and never will be
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: You can be cool
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôre cool
10/21/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Can be
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Oof
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: "you're capable of it"
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: No I mean even if I don‚Äôt consider myself you can consider yourself because I believe it
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: But yes technically I also do mean you are capable of it
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Maybe not when you‚Äôre being clumsy
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: I mean it‚Äôs cool to me
10/21/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Charming even
10/21/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: I do believe I've been called "charmingly clumsy"
10/21/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: But anyway thank you
10/21/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: I was just joking about the "can be" thing but it's still all sweet of you to say
10/21/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: And for the record, I do think you're a super cool person
10/21/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Genuinely
10/21/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Well I hate to break it to you
10/21/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: But you‚Äôre wrong
10/21/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Actually I think I can be cool to certain people but I am pretty against myself ever being universally cool
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: My ego would not survive
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: But anyway
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Universally cool is overrated anyway
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the studying going?
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mean to distract from it
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs my thinking
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: But if people are and want it then good for them
10/21/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: What's the point in everyone thinking you're cool if you can't truly be yourself
10/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: Unless your true self is just super cool.
10/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: In which case, eh
10/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: Also yeah studying is not great
10/21/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: I honestly don't think it'll be too bad though
10/21/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Nordic mythology rehashes a lot of the same content honestly
10/21/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Also, did I ever tell you about my Russian friend I made in China
10/21/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah I feel like with greek plays and Shakespeare it‚Äôs like on like there are common themes so sometimes guessing isn‚Äôt too bad
10/21/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: And no!
10/21/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah, and also we've had surprisingly few classes
10/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: I'm looking at my calendar and this is totally manageable
10/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: I just need refreshers on stories
10/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: And oh! I never really finished telling you about China
10/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: I think I only covered the first two days
10/21/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Do you want me to just save it for Tuesday and I can give you a bunch of pictures to accompany all the stories?
10/21/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: That works with me!
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Cool
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: i
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: o
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: I mean ok
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Yeah I was looking at my classes while studying and I only have had like 12 classes in each
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: See if you can spot me
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I mean granted it‚Äôs 24 hours of material but still
10/21/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I see you
10/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Yay
10/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Well that's him to the right of me on my row
10/21/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Is that the hike from the last day
10/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Yep!
10/21/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Cool you had a good group of people
10/21/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt know qualitatively but quantitatively
10/21/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs me I‚Äôm much more qualified to do quantitative analysis
10/21/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I mostly hung out with him, and then like 3 girls from the front row, and then the curly haired guy in the front row
10/21/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: It was an exciting bunch
10/21/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Those are the people I went swimming in the south China sea with
10/21/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: But yeah, great group
10/21/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Quite the eclectic bunch, they were from all over Europe
10/21/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: And my friend is from Moscow
10/21/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: And he made me want to visit it pretty badly
10/21/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Not gonna lie Russia sounds better than China
10/21/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: You know it's good when the Russian complains about the government oppression there
10/21/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: It sounds like you just got so much exposure to different people and cultures in your week
10/21/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Moscow does look pretty
10/21/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Not sure I‚Äôd ever want to go there
10/21/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also really hard to go there
10/21/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Like you have to be recommended to get a visa
10/21/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Some people in the program were doing it
10/21/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: But yeah that‚Äôs a little telling off China seems oppressive
10/21/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: To a Russian
10/21/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Yeah but he was also living in Switzerland at the time.
10/21/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: But we were taking about the metro system, and apparently ever station is a museum
10/21/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Like, they have history about old Russian life and the metro and the world
10/21/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: And it's actual exhibits, I'm not just saying it's been untouched since the 80s
10/21/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: How cool is that
10/21/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: That is pretty cool
10/21/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: I do like seeing history in these old cities
10/21/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Like bruh this was here how long ago?!?!
10/21/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/21/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's crazy
10/21/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: And also why I'm taking a class on the history of Copenhagen
10/21/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Like, I walk by a church from the 1100s  every day
10/21/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: How cool is that
10/21/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I kind of wish I was doing Budapest studies
10/21/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve got too many classes
10/21/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: But yeah it‚Äôs crazy we get to live in these places for 3 months when we‚Äôre 20/21
10/21/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: I totally had that epiphany today
10/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Like, I feel a little cool because I was in China for a week
10/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: ... It's cool compared to a bunch of kids living in Europe
10/21/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Like how far is that whole situation above the baseline of what the hell this is cool
10/21/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: It's all wild, and it's so easy to forget
10/21/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Yeah while I was like AH China I don‚Äôt have any interest in going there and missing school I was a little jealous that you got to
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: It is just such a cool time and circumstance to do that
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Like you got to fit THAT into your semester abroad
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: And as first author
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Well that wasn‚Äôt abroad
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: But still incredibly cool
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhh there was a lot of edits abroad
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: There's a reason I have a VPN for work
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: But yeah
10/21/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Oh good point
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Like what's even going on anymore
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: How did I get here
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: How did we get here
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: But anyway it‚Äôs bedtime for bonzo over here
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: But idk
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: This semester is like surreal
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: If like five years ago, you told me I would be here
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Ask me about my whole ability to see myself in situations vs this semester later
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah exactly
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Anyway
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I would have laughed at you
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Really gotta sleep
10/21/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt laugh at me
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: I mean, where am I gonna be in 5 more
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Actually you can laugh at me
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: I know it was a colloquium
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: That's kinda terrifying
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Oh you know what word I mean
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: And yeah idk
10/21/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Ha

10/22/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: Damn I told you to drink water man
10/22/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: And aw, can I ask what it was?
10/22/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: True
10/22/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: I have been trying to a lot today because I‚Äôm pretty sure I was pretty dehydrated yesterday
10/22/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: And just the train ride in general and the tunnel and such
10/22/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Also idk why but I‚Äôm currently very happy because we learned the cardinal directions in Hungarian like idk I just like them and knowing that
10/22/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: What times your final today?
10/22/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Final is at 1:15

10/22/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Or midterm
10/22/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Not final
10/22/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Yikes

10/22/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Thaaaanks
10/22/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: I'll let you know how it goes
10/22/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: Went fairly well
10/22/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: Which means I'm coasting for like two more weeks
10/22/19, 1:52 PM - Caleb: But also nothing I studied was on there
10/22/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Yay!
10/22/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Then uh either what we‚Äôre you studying or what was on the test?
10/22/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: I was studying the tales of the sagas
10/22/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: The test was a lot of meta information about the texts and history of vikings
10/22/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: So eh
10/22/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: It was okay
10/22/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: Not great
10/22/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: Hey whatever
10/22/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: Now it‚Äôs done!
10/22/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the rest of your day like?
10/22/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Well
10/22/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: I don't have anything in the morning
10/22/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: I don't think
10/22/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: So I was planning on Szheuan food with Derek, Woo, and Nathan
10/22/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: And then probably hit a bodega
10/22/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: All swap stories over a smoke filled cozy bar
10/22/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: Okay I just got a snapchat of my one friend from high school, Zoe, hanging out with Austin Craig from Davidson who I had Lin Alg with
10/22/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: What a small world
10/22/19, 2:48 PM - Caleb: What the heck
10/22/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Oooh that sounds like a good plan
10/22/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre all getting barbecue for dinner over here
10/22/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: And woah that‚Äôs crazy
10/22/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: I think the world has gotten smaller since we‚Äôve all moved to Europe
10/22/19, 3:12 PM - Caleb: Oh man for real
10/22/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: There's also a couple of people that I'm like, what are you even doing in Europe
10/22/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: Like, literally are you just traveling around or do you go somewhere
10/22/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: How's your day been by the way?
10/22/19, 3:28 PM - Marianna: Yeah some I never see in one place
10/22/19, 3:29 PM - Marianna: And good!  I‚Äôm watching Jane the virgin before theory and midterm review class
10/22/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: Okay how into Jane the Virgin are you
10/22/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: Because I feel like you've watched at least an episode a day
10/22/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: Well she‚Äôs no longer a virgin
10/22/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: Season 3
10/22/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Ah
10/22/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Well good for her I guess
10/22/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Can't say I know the plot super well
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs a virgin
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Apparently that‚Äôs a novelty
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Well
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: I figured that much
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah they do give that part away a bit
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Anyway
10/22/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: What have you been up to?  Relaxing I hope
10/22/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Well
10/22/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: I found this Japanese piano guy on youtube that I listened to like 7/8 years ago
10/22/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: And it's wild to hear these videos because it's what inspired me musically a lot
10/22/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: And I completely forgot about him
10/22/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Every one of his videos has a pink stuffed monkey in it, and it's really bringing me back
10/22/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: Oh man I used to sit down for hours and hours and try to play these songs
10/22/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Awwww
10/22/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Sounds like a trip down memory road
10/22/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: I love hearing songs and being like woah I haven‚Äôt heard this since doing homework at my kitchen table or since playing plants versus zombies on my old bed in my pink room
10/22/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: And yes I know exactly what songs remind me of both of those thin gas
10/22/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: Things**
10/22/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: What songs?
10/22/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: Also you can clearly see how the attention being paid in thsi class is a gradient towards the back of the room
10/22/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: Ah well darn I‚Äôd have to find their names on my spotify
10/22/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: Nope I got it

10/22/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: This is the one that hits me the hardest

10/22/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: It feels like forever since I've talked to you
10/22/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: Probably not unless it's right now for 30 minutes
10/22/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Or actually let‚Äôs just make it after and we‚Äôll both be tipsy maybe
10/22/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Ah no

10/22/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Talking?
10/22/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: But we‚Äôre such untalkative people
10/22/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Wow you're a sarcastic one tonight, aren't ya
10/22/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Idk, maybe I'm not actually a super talkative person
10/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Yeah sorry boot it
10/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: And you talk to ex cons on trains
10/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: That means you‚Äôre talkative
10/22/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I know I know they may be doing most of the talking
10/22/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Idk
10/22/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: I don't think you've experienced me super talkative
10/22/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: I can get there but it's usually if it's something I'm passionate about and someone who I know is genuinely interested
10/22/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: And re the ex con thing: I also really love listening and learning and asking questions
10/22/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: Idk if that counts as talkative
10/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: What I haven‚Äôt?!
10/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Okay well can that please happen
10/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I like listening to you talk about cool stuff
10/22/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: I'm in love with the vibe of this bodega
10/22/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: I just sent you a snap of it
10/22/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: And yeah I think we can make that happen
10/22/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: I mean you can try
10/22/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: I can try?
10/22/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Making you talk?
10/22/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: I think I only really know how to make you _stop_ taking üòâ
10/22/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Kidding
10/22/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: Ohareyanow
10/22/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: But also yeah I want to be that way around you
10/22/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I feel like you still haven't seen a good bit of who I am or who I am be
10/22/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm a bit drunk at this point
10/22/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: I dont think any of it is bad though
10/22/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: But like idk
10/22/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: :(
10/22/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: But I want to know you
10/22/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: And I want to think I know you
10/22/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: I think even if I don‚Äôt know ever detail about you I still know you like in the kind of person sense
10/22/19, 8:14 PM - Marianna: And idk
10/22/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôm just assuming I do because we‚Äôve been in almost constant communication for so long but when I think about it we haven‚Äôt spent a ton of time actually together
10/22/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: A little freaky
10/22/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: But whatever
10/22/19, 8:15 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs all good
10/22/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Does that actually freak you out?
10/22/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Only like woah it feels like we‚Äôve spent so much time together but it‚Äôs been like less than a month total that we‚Äôve been hanging out and in the same city like at davidson we spent some days together but then after that it‚Äôs been spotty for not that long
10/22/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/22/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/22/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/22/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: It honestly weirds me out a little too
10/22/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: But the thing is, I know you enough to know that I want to be in it and get to know all of you
10/22/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: And I want you to know all of me
10/22/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Even if we're not 100% there yet
10/22/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: Im totally sure in who you are and that I've made the right choices of what im/we're doing here
10/22/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: It's a path that I know I want to go down, which I definitely don't say about most people
10/22/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm rambling at this point
10/22/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah I guess that‚Äôs what I mean when I say I know you
10/22/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: But it does scare me to think I don‚Äôt know you
10/22/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: But I guess I don‚Äôt
10/22/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt I want to know you
10/22/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Which is basically all of what you just said
10/22/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: Anyway anyway anyway

10/22/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: But the point is
10/22/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: I really like you, and I know I really like you, and I know I'll keep on liking you no matter what comes up and what we discover
10/22/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: So yey
10/22/19, 9:17 PM - Caleb: I'm great though!
10/22/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: We've been hanging out in a smoke filled bodega by a canal drinking beer
10/22/19, 9:18 PM - Caleb: And just generally being goofballs and having a carefree night
10/22/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: What is...tuborg
10/22/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: Well hey you don‚Äôt know I could be a mass murderer don‚Äôt give me that blanket statement yet
10/22/19, 9:32 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think you won‚Äôt like any part of me though

10/22/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: And oof I feel bad
10/22/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: This is what they were stressed about
10/22/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: No
10/23/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Even better
10/23/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: She's staying across the street in an AirBnB
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so awkward
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: I feel bad for her
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Although, gotta say, it's a little awkward when I go in to grab things to shower, turn around, and she's laying on his bed
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: He broke up with her?
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: After sleeping in another girl's bed where "nothing happened"
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Yeaaaah
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Well
10/23/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Do you think something happened
10/23/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: I think his bed was readily available for him and he chose to sleep with another girl and cuddle drunk for a night
10/23/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: And other than that does it matter if something else happened there
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: Aw well can you blame him
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: But not okay
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: But drunk people man
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: They‚Äôre dumb
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: I mean
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: No objectively you can
10/23/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/23/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm drunk and very forgiving when drunk
10/23/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Like what part of that is part
10/23/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Okay
10/23/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: What
10/23/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: Part?
10/23/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: Yeah of just being willingly sleeping in a girls bed with her, after having been flirting all day, all while having a girlfriend
10/23/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: AND you can easily get to your own bed
10/23/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: Oh the flirting changes it
10/23/19, 12:07 AM - Caleb: The devansh thing was different because it was our of necessity and there was nothing earlier
10/23/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve slept in the same bed as a few of my friends
10/23/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: Partially because they were drunk and didn‚Äôt want to make them go home
10/23/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: But it wasn‚Äôt flirty
10/23/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: It was like yo you‚Äôve been kicked out or your wasted just go to sleep
10/23/19, 12:08 AM - Marianna: Oh man I love wine

10/23/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: I just never like this topic
10/23/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: And I'm trying to get the smell of cigarettes off me in the shower
10/23/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: What topic?
10/23/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: And oof yeah I guess not everyone likes the smell of cigarettes
10/23/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: I'm fine with the smell
10/23/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: I just don't want to bring it in bed with me
10/23/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs valid
10/23/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Sometimes my room just smells like it
10/23/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôll have the windows open
10/23/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs SO HOT here
10/23/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: Windows open and everything it gets crazy
10/23/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Hey hey hey
10/23/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Kid
10/23/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: You rock
10/23/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: I would never not go to my bed I genuinely have no interest in sleeping in the same bed with anyone but you
10/23/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Idk if we‚Äôve moved on
10/23/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: But if we haven‚Äôt
10/23/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the genuine truth
10/23/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: But call in like 15 min?
10/23/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Or not
10/23/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Whatever works with you
10/23/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Ha, I thought you'd never ask :)
10/23/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: And thanks
10/23/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Idk I still feel weird about it, but I think at this point it's more of a me-issue
10/23/19, 12:26 AM - Caleb: It's really nothing worrying about though, it's just like a euuuffjh thing for me to think of someone else sleeping in your bed with you
10/23/19, 12:26 AM - Caleb: Which I feel like is a pretty normal response, even if there are some circumstances that I think it's justified
10/23/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: Yeah I feel like that‚Äôs fair
10/23/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt love if someone else slept in your bed but I think if you explained I‚Äôd be like ah okay nothing happened and there was a legit reason. But I understand that if I can be like that you 100% don‚Äôt have the think the same way
10/23/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: And I have to adapt to how you feel about this
10/23/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Because I don‚Äôt want to upset you and it‚Äôs not something I like have a strong opinion or stance on
10/23/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: But even without that I wouldn‚Äôt want to have someone else here
10/23/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: Maybe Sarah
10/23/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: But only if she or I was upset
10/23/19, 12:32 AM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs 100% different and if you‚Äôre not okay with that I‚Äôd understand and not
10/23/19, 12:33 AM - Marianna: But again that‚Äôs not because I cave easily necessarily but because I care about not upsetting you and this isn‚Äôt actually a big deal to me and I hate if I‚Äôve made it seem like it
10/23/19, 12:37 AM - Caleb: Yeah I'm all good with Sarah, don't worry
10/23/19, 12:38 AM - Caleb: But yeah I think we've made this a bigger deal when it needs to be
10/23/19, 12:38 AM - Caleb: Like, it's a gradient of discomfort for me
10/23/19, 12:39 AM - Caleb: If a guy just wanted to sleep in your bed because he wanted to, then yeah no that's not okay with me
10/23/19, 12:39 AM - Caleb: If it's Devansh drunk as heck at 3am and can't physically get home, like yeah it's a little out of my comfort zone but I totally understand if it's necessary
10/23/19, 12:40 AM - Caleb: It's just hard to communicate over text because I feel like this would be a pretty body-langauge heavy discussion
10/23/19, 12:40 AM - Caleb: anyway, call?
10/23/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: Yeah people are still in the kitchen but I was ready for sleep
10/23/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm in my room
10/23/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: Oh man bed is so nice
10/23/19, 12:41 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm ready to call whenever
10/23/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: Oh tell me about it
10/23/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: I'm wrapped in my favorite blanket and I've got Peety
10/23/19, 12:55 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 12:58 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 1:06 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 1:49 AM - Marianna: Goodnight goodnight!  Good having you bac in the time zone
10/23/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: Good morning!
10/23/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: Gotta say, nice to be able to sleep in again
10/23/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Gooooood morning
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Ooo
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: And yes
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Sleeping until noon is my heaven
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Sliding into the morning
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: About 8 minutes close
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: But now I feel the guilty thing because I have so much studying to do!
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Hey hey hey
10/23/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Morning is whenever I wake up
10/23/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: The world revolves around me
10/23/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: I think you should frame that and have it on your wall
10/23/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Instead of "Live, Laugh, Love"
10/23/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Or one of those oversized signs that just says "EAT" hanging in your kitchen
10/23/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Yeah
10/23/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I think it will really be the welcoming sign into my abode
10/23/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Like this is the kind of person who lives here
10/23/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Deal with it
10/23/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: (But also she‚Äôs kidding she‚Äôs just lazy when it comes to getting up)
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Man, we've really come far from the whole "sleeping in" thing
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: We're really reading into this aren't we
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Hey nothing like starting the psychoanalysis early in the day
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: ..or not early in the day
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: While I still have a headache from the night before
10/23/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Perfect timing
10/23/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Hungover headache or just regular headache?
10/23/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: You know I can't really tell
10/23/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: I don't think I was really drunk last night, but I definitely wasn't drinking enough wooder
10/23/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: I'm a real hypocrite ain't I
10/23/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Oh the worst!
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: Kidding again
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: Hey what can I say
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry about the headache either way
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I'm a pro at giving great advice that I don't follow
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: Andimgonnarecomendyoudrinkwaterbutyoudidnthearitfromme
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I know what I _should_ do, I just don't do it
10/23/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: Oh, oh no
10/23/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Just trying to read this is making the headache worse
10/23/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: It looks like one of those oddly specific German words that's like 6 words put together
10/23/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: MaKe iT gO aWAy
10/23/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm sorry
10/23/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: And-I‚Äôm-gonna-recommend-you-drink-water-but-you-didnt-hear-it-from-me
10/23/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: ... And my head
10/23/19, 12:18 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs a good big cup o water
10/23/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: I drank a lot of water during the day yesterday and before I started drinking last night
10/23/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm peachy this morning
10/23/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: Goons eat cereal and maybe some cake and watch jane the virgin for breakfast
10/23/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: Goons
10/23/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: Sounds like a fun morning
10/23/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: "morning"
10/23/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: I've got a 2 hour field study at 1
10/23/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: Then I'm hanging with Kathryn Abely and planning a class thing
10/23/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: We're the two moderators for our med ethics class, so we need to figure out the format for tomorrow
10/23/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: Gonna **
10/23/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: Goons!!!
10/23/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: And oof
10/23/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: I forgot about the field studies
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Eh
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Honestly they're usually pretty enjoyable
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: It's just when it's an 8am Wednesday
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Or if it's a full day Saturday
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: Spring on you during an especially inconvenient weekend üôÉ
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Yeah boooooooo those
10/23/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: But that was a one time deal
10/23/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: So after Jane the Virgin and cake and cereal, whatcha got today?
10/23/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: I was literally thinking when I woke up this morning how I‚Äôd like to be showing you around Budapest today
10/23/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: Coffee stop to study crypto
10/23/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: Coding test
10/23/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: Yoga
10/23/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: More studying
10/23/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Well
10/23/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: That'd be a lot of fun
10/23/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: I'm low-key pretty sad I'm not gonna be back at some point, I feel like there's a few more things that would be super fun with you there
10/23/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: And good luck with the test! You've got this
10/23/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Hey you can be back sometime in your life
10/23/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Very manageable
10/23/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: And yeah I almost wish I was visiting Copenhagen again because I know I definitely didn‚Äôt get to see all of it
10/23/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Oh and also would you want to call tonight to talk about Barcelona or soemwhere?
10/23/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah definitely
10/23/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: I'll be free tonight, what time are you thinking?
10/23/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: And maybe like 10? Or 9?
10/23/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: Something like that
10/23/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhh oh god i need to do that soon
10/23/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: And yeah that works
10/23/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: ALSO
10/23/19, 2:14 PM - Caleb: Do you like old books
10/23/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: You do have 2 whole weeks
10/23/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: Wait I don‚Äôt think you answered do you go to London next week?
10/23/19, 2:18 PM - Caleb: Yeeperoni
10/23/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: And I mean I think I like them as much as anyone who likes books in general
10/23/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: OHHH se you excited
10/23/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: Are**
10/23/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 2:25 PM - Caleb: We got to see some 13th century manuscripts
10/23/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: The second they brought them in, the whole room smelled like old books
10/23/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Is this history of Copenhagen or mythology?
10/23/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Mythology
10/23/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Which makes it even cooler
10/23/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: (Because I doubt it‚Äôs the neural networks or medical ethics but I may be wrong)
10/23/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: And oooh I do love the smell of books
10/23/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Even new books
10/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: But oh they‚Äôre this gigantic used book store in Jackson california that we always go to and it smells wonderful
10/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: They also have a coffee stand inside and a few cats just wandering the shelves
10/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: And there was like a Sherlock Holmes set of rooms inside last time we went
10/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Still not sure what that was about
10/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: Why does that make it cooler?
10/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: Are they original mythology works?  Like from when the stories originated?
10/23/19, 2:42 PM - Marianna: Did denmark mythology go by oral tradition or by manuscripts mostly?
10/23/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: Well, I mean it's cool to see old books about history
10/23/19, 2:49 PM - Caleb: But it's _way_ cooler to see old books about viking sagas
10/23/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: They're not the originals because a lot of the traditions were passed down from generation to generation orally
10/23/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: But these were pretty close to that era
10/23/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: They're old enough that paper wasn't a thing, so the first one I sent was written on calfskin
10/23/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: Oh man, I also love used book stores
10/23/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: I'm actually meeting Kathryn in a used book store/Cafe
10/23/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: It's called Paludan B√∏ger
10/23/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: Hygge^2
10/23/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Ohh that does sound really cool
10/23/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Ah but I hate the idea of a book on animal skin ‚òπ
10/23/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Like it makes sense
10/23/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Use what you got and all that
10/23/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: And Marion showed us that!!!
10/23/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: She said it reminds her of beauty and the beast
10/23/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: It did like super pretty
10/23/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: We just popped in
10/23/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/23/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you saw it
10/23/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: It's my first time and I'm like woah
10/23/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Hey I miss you
10/23/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Anyway
10/23/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah it looked beautiful
10/23/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Did you get coffee?
10/23/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Oh oh this is important
10/23/19, 3:11 PM - Marianna: Do you just get regular coffee when you go to a cute coffee shop?
10/23/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/23/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: Miss ya too
10/23/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: See you soon :)
10/23/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: And Mar
10/23/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: Are you asking me
10/23/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: If I go into an adorable coffee shop, with cute books and calm lights and quaint colors
10/23/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: And get a black coffee
10/23/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: ...yes
10/23/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt hate you whatever you say but I NEED TO KNOW
10/23/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: I'll let you guess first
10/23/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: What type of person do you think I am
10/23/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Am I a boring black coffee drinker through and through?
10/23/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Or am I a frilly, expensive, sugary drink orderer?
10/23/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Well
10/23/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: I have been at a coffee shop with you and you got a dirty chai
10/23/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: But I also feel like you like your black coffee for its efficiency and Pyrenees
10/23/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Pureness
10/23/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Not mountain dogs
10/23/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Miss the Pyrenees rescues though
10/23/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna guess you keep it classy and simple
10/23/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Final answer?
10/23/19, 3:34 PM - Marianna: Black
10/23/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Also yes I love Pyrenees too
10/23/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: One of the best days every year
10/23/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Okay SO
10/23/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: My policy
10/23/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: If I'm going somewhere that's known to have good or unique coffee
10/23/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: Like the places that roast and grind their beans
10/23/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: I'll get black coffee because I like the stronger more unique flavor
10/23/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: But if I'm going somewhere for the atmosphere or experience, I'll get something more tasty and fun
10/23/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: Like the dirty chai
10/23/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: But I still don't like hyper sugary things, so I get something in between
10/23/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Oh interesting
10/23/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm actually the same way
10/23/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: Like that‚Äôs what I did when I went to Kelet cafe because they have Budapest beans
10/23/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: Or famous Hungarian beans or soemthing
10/23/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: But now that I think about it I doubt they can grow beans here
10/23/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: But it was something
10/23/19, 3:44 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Did I tell you joeys a dumbass and now needs surgery and got caught in a lie with my mom?
10/23/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Hey good call on that then
10/23/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Idk though, I definitely didn't take you for a black coffee person
10/23/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: And NO WHAT DID HE DO
10/23/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: I like black coffee sometimes
10/23/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd rather have a latte
10/23/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Or my new love black coffee with honey
10/23/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll tell you the full story tonight it‚Äôs quite a saga
10/23/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: Is it related to the Tale of Joey and the Glass Pitcher
10/23/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: And why he couldn't feel his hand
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Yes
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs ~evolved~
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Oh I meant to have the ~
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: I do that in text
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Stupid WhatsApp
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: I will be very happy when we can go back to texting
10/23/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Really?
10/23/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Ngl what's app has grown on me
10/23/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: I can do _this_ or *this* or ```even spam you with monospaced font```
10/23/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: And also I lost all my chat logs with you which is kinda sad
10/23/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: Anyway, can't wait to hear Ye Olde Saga of Joey the Foolish
10/23/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah that is cool
10/23/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: But I like getting my texts on my Fitbit
10/23/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: And that only happens with texts
10/23/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: Oh when you switched phones?
10/23/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Also man weather is just wonderful
10/23/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Day has been wonderful
10/23/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Life is wonderful
10/23/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: It was actually before when I had my old phone and tried to factory reset it
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: And it said I backed up the texts, and then when I went to my drive it said it was 0kb
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: And I was like
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Okayy
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Also that's awesome! Glad to hear it
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Tell me about your day!
10/23/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Ah got to love 0kb files
10/23/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Like good I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs all there
10/23/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs actually been pretty boring
10/23/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: But robin Sarah and I worked in a coffee shop for a bit
10/23/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And now I‚Äôm home again
10/23/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Gonna take my test starting soon
10/23/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: So if you don‚Äôt hear back from me I‚Äôm fine I‚Äôm just trying to GET A JOB
10/23/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Hey that sounds like a lovely day
10/23/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: When are you starting your test?
10/23/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Like now
10/23/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: See ya
10/23/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/23/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: You
10/23/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: You're smart and hardworking, and I think you'll do great
10/23/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: I'm very proud of you, and hope it goes well
10/23/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: And I can't wait to hear about it afterwards
10/23/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Done
10/23/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Coding was a piece of cake
10/23/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: YAY
10/23/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: Congrats
10/23/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: The conceptual stuff I was like woah haven‚Äôt had these questions since like 121 and 212
10/23/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: 221*
10/23/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: What were some of the questions?
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: One was a question about what a certain step of testing is in software development
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: And man idk
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Others were like what will this print or will it not compile
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: What language?
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: And then extending classes stuff
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Java for the multiple choice
10/23/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Which I haven‚Äôt used in a year
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: And I got to choose for the coding and I went with good ol python
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Because that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing in classes this semester
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: You
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm hoping they will see I know logic
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: You're awesome
10/23/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: I'm glad it went well
10/23/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Like I feel like that‚Äôs more important than multiple choice you can google
10/23/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Oh 100%
10/23/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think the multiple choice went too well
10/23/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm hoping they don‚Äôt care as much about that
10/23/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Probably not
10/23/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: The deal with a lot of these interviews is that it isn't about what answer you get, it's about how you get to it
10/23/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: You can teach someone the right answers, but you can't teach someone quick thinking and reasoning like that
10/23/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Yeah I feel like the multiple choice were dumb
10/23/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: But some companies might have a base level percent right or they don‚Äôt consider you
10/23/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/23/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: In other news odds I apply for a spotify software internship in Gothenburg?
10/23/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Low key wish more companies had stuff in Hungary
10/23/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: Iiiiiiiin Gothenburg?
10/23/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/23/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: It's a decent city
10/23/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: I can link you up with Olof and Anna if you want
10/23/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: Eh I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd actually go with it but thank you
10/23/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: Cool that they have it though
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: And just applied to amazon!
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: So have you only looked at Dallas?
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: WOAH
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: That's awesome
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: No Dallas is just southwest
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: How are you feeling about everything so far?
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve applied to southwest, Amazon, vanguard, etsy, and maybe one more at this point
10/23/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/23/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: I would love to be near dc and home I think
10/23/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: Or California
10/23/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: But besides southwest being my top choice
10/23/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt really care exactly where I end up
10/23/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: I would really like a job that is fun
10/23/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm trying to only apply to things that genuinely interest me
10/23/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: You know, that's all totally fair
10/23/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure how I'm feeling about living in Philly again next summer
10/23/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: Honestly part of me is just scared about it all
10/23/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: Also have you actually been looking at anything in California?
10/23/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: And also now that I think about it, what places have you been looking at near your home? Idk if I've heard a whole lot about this
10/23/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm kind of of the opinion that I don‚Äôt totally care where I end up next summer. If it‚Äôs somewhere new, yay!  A new adventure!  And if it‚Äôs somewhere I‚Äôve been before then that will be fine too
10/23/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: And well haven‚Äôt actually looked at much in cali or near home but that would be my goal
10/23/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: So Yelp is Bay Area and I need to apply to that one
Southwest‚ÄîDallas
Vanguard‚Äîpa somewhere and I may apply to their one in Charlotte too
Etsy‚ÄîNew York
Amazon-Seattle, dc, or Bay Area
10/23/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: Ah, there's that adventurous spirit
10/23/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: Well like I said, I think you're the type of person that would be happy and do well pretty much anywhere
10/23/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: You'll make the best of whatever comes, so you really can't go wrong
10/23/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Yeah I hope
10/23/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: But I also know if I end up in a city that I don‚Äôt know anyone I‚Äôm gonna be very lonely for a summer
10/23/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: I like having people
10/23/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: But I feel like most of these internships a lot of kids are in that boat
10/23/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: So new friends!
10/23/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Are you actually going to look at anything besides penn?  Or go back there?
10/23/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: You ever go for a run at night
10/23/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: And just stumble across something weird looking and you're like "yeah I'm just gonna go the other way and leave now"
10/23/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Because that just happened
10/23/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: And no, a huge part of me thinks I'd be stupid to look anywhere else or do anything because no one of that caliber is going to be willing to hire me
10/23/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Like I got lucky enough the first time around, there's 0 chance that's gonna happen again
10/23/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: No not usually
10/23/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Mostly because I‚Äôm a girl so don‚Äôt really go running at night for obvious reasons
10/23/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôd you stumble across
10/23/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Oh and I went to yoga for the first time in like a month!  It felt amazing but not easy
10/23/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah you do have a pretty sweet gig rn
10/23/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: And if you like it I don‚Äôt see whyd you‚Äôd see if _maybe_ you‚Äôd like something else because you really might not and that would suck
10/23/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: You know, that's totally fair and I never really thought of that
10/23/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: My bad
10/23/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: But hey, if you ever want to do a night run at Davidson, let me know and I'll come with
10/23/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: But anyway
10/23/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: I just was running through a park, and found these people all laying on the ground, and some people doing weird motions, and some people hitting the ground
10/23/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: And then I realized it was like a nighttime workout deal, and they were all on yoga mats and it made sense
10/23/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: But for a brief second, I was very confused and slightly concerned
10/23/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: And really the only reason I'd want to do something else is because I'd want to do something with more adventure in it, but at the same time I gotta have some perspective because I _literally_ just got back from a work trip to China
10/23/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Nah nah it‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs just kind of a thing. It‚Äôs weird when I bring it up with guy friends they all go like wait what oh I didn‚Äôt think about that which is interesting because women can‚Äôt NOT think about it that‚Äôs low key dangerous
10/23/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not mad or anything
10/23/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: More just commenting on the society of it
10/23/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: And oh okay much less sketchy than what it sounded like
10/23/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôd say your job has plenty of adventure
10/23/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Update Sarah just walked in and said ‚ÄúUm so while you were gone I really wanted to have a dance party with someone but you weren‚Äôt here‚Äù so I was like oh so you want to now
10/23/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: So we did
10/23/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Kitchen was just lit-er than instant for a hot second
10/23/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: Whaaaat
10/23/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: That sounds fun
10/23/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: All I did tonight was go for a run
10/23/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: And then came back, decided to not go see Joker with Hana and Reid and his ex, and then laid down
10/23/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: OH then there was a really bright flash and loud bang outside
10/23/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: So I got on my bike to try to find what was going on, but couldn't find anything
10/23/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: No one was really reacting either and there were no major sirens, so I figured it was probably an exhaust pipe backfiring
10/23/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Twas fun
10/23/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I do like spontaneous dance parties
10/23/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: I feel like you experienced a tiny bit of one while packing with me
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: But I was also probably trying very hard not to embarrass myself
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: So maybe not
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: And oof I support that decision
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Can I shower and then call you
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: Also I just sent this to my mom:
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: And DONT BRING IT UP
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Nothing embarrassing happened on that fateful night of course
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: DONT YOU
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: NOPE
10/23/19, 9:49 PM - Marianna: I BEHAVED SO WELL
10/23/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: _absolutely nothing..._
10/23/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: HA let me know what she says
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: And yeah! That sounds good
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: I'll probably just get ready for bed then
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: She might be driving to DAVIDSON rn
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Oh Joey
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Call in a few see ya
10/23/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness
10/23/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: MAR
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: I KNOW YOU SHOULD BE TRYING TO SLEEP
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: BUT
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Ah lovely
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Everyone‚Äôs favorite
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Honestly poor him but what did he expect
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Marc "Chaw in his Jaw" "The Narc" Todd
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: What a nickname
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: What a dude
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: But I thought the whole joke was he wasn‚Äôt a narc
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhhhh
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Oh Marianna
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: You really didn't know him well did you
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: At least in mock trial he‚Äôs very much an enabler of everything
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: He'd rat you out if he even gained a little from it
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: The man has 0 loyalty and 100% self interest
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: I've got all sorts of RLO stories
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Poured me my first vodka cranberry freshman year after I apparently put too little vodka in
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah, that's him alright
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: He'd let things slide not out of watching out for you, but out of laziness
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: The man couldn't be bothered to do paperwork, and thus had the reputation as the chill HC
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Idk he‚Äôs still an enabler in my opinion
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Ohh I see
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: That does make sense
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs apparently being a crap mock trial president
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: If anything came up though and he was in any danger, you'd be going under the bus in a heartbeat
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Oh well good to know I guess
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Yeah, don't trust him
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: But I also could get him in loads of trouble for buying me alcohol on a few different occasions
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Soooo
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: I've witnessed some w h a c k stuff
10/23/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Including:
10/23/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Well if you ever need to throw HIM under the bus just let me know
10/23/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Nah these are stories for another night
10/23/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: And thanks but I'm not out to get him
10/23/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I think the best thing is to just keep distance
10/23/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Okay yes I need to sleep and it‚Äôs not exactly the texts I want to read from my boyfriend when I wake up
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Hey you
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Hey
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: You're gonna do great tomorrow
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs up
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Hey
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Thanks
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: And I'm so happy things went well today
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna do great sleep rn
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: And me too
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Let me know how your midterm goes

10/24/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Goodnight!
10/24/19, 4:08 AM - Marianna: Ironically enough I am not sleeping well
10/24/19, 4:09 AM - Marianna: Been awake for about 30 min
10/24/19, 4:09 AM - Marianna: The end is not in sight

10/24/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: But also yeah you got some other stuff too I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/24/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Also kind of related. I was thinking about it and I don‚Äôt think i want to skip my classes Monday morning. Even if profs say it won‚Äôt affect my grade I‚Äôm the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt skip class. That being said I still REALLY REALLY want to go to Barcelona with you and don‚Äôt want you to leave Sunday morning. I may try to look for later flights like Sunday night but would you still be okay with flying out Monday morning?  I know it‚Äôs not ideal but Barcelona is amazing I‚Äôm jealous that you can stay the extra night and if the places were flipped it‚Äôd be rough to see you go home earlier but I think I‚Äôd still do it that way. Thoughts?  Oh and I‚Äôd still split the Airbnb costs for 3 nights even if I‚Äôm not there to be fair
10/24/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: But if you really don‚Äôt want to we can look for other options
10/24/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: First off, yeah I really really don't blame you
10/24/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I understand and wouldn't want to ask something of you that would make you uncomfortable like that
10/24/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: So as much as I'd like to be with you in Barcelona for as long as possible, it's okay
10/24/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I'm not sure I want to fly back Monday morning honestly, it would be different if you were there, but without that extra incentive I feel like it's still a Sunday night and I'd rather get home comfortably and make it to class the next morning
10/24/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: So I think I'll just suck up the costs and fly back Sunday night depending on how expensive it is
10/24/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll talk to my parents about it and see if they're willing to help pay for anything
10/24/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: Okay but I‚Äôm looking and not only did you flight fri go up since last night but all the late options are crazy expensive so idk if it‚Äôs worth it. I may ask sarah if she‚Äôs want to do Barcelona the next weekend. We‚Äôd have to figure out what to do with her Friday afternoon class but idk
10/24/19, 12:17 PM - Marianna: Because also looking at brussels, there is NO option besides 6am Sunday for your return Sunday
10/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: Ah idk I thought it worked so perfectly
10/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: But I need to nap rn to recharge and study for my midterm and don‚Äôt really want to stress about this
10/24/19, 12:19 PM - Marianna: You can look at it if you want but idk what works
10/24/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah don't stess about it rn
10/24/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: You have better things to worry about, this will work out
10/24/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Or something will at least
10/24/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: On a scale of 1-10, how much is Barcelona your top place
10/24/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: Like 1 being no real reason, 5 being ambivalent, and 10 being you've always always wanted to go there
10/24/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: Okay my Brain is too on to nap but I also shouldn‚Äôt spend my time doing this rn I need to be productive if I‚Äôm not gonna nap
10/24/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôve been there
10/24/19, 12:31 PM - Marianna: 4 years ago
10/24/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: But I really wanted to get to Spain and I really liked it when I did go
10/24/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: And if I wanted to go with Sarah, she‚Äôs probably have to skip at least half of her data science class because it ends at 6 and all the flights leave at 8pm every Friday
10/24/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Okay it totally corrected to Brian and you had to change it, didn't you
10/24/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: But I guess I could go by myself some weekend if I found a weekend I wasn‚Äôt already doing something
10/24/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: And yes
10/24/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: Brain is ON
10/24/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: rememver
10/24/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: And yeah okay don't worry about it, just focus on midterms and I'll work it out
10/24/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: Okay would you have time to look at traveling places today?
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I absolutely can
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Seriously don't worry about it
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: But also I guess I just don‚Äôt understand why you are opposed to spending 12 more hours in an awesome city for a relatively cheap flight
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Stressful is the last thing planning a vacation should be
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: I already feel bad your flight is more than mine
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Stressful and vacation shouldn't be in the same sentence
10/24/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Unless, you know, "not" is in there somewhere
10/24/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/24/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: But it works!  It‚Äôs just not optimal for you but it could be doable which is more frustrating that there‚Äôs no good flights back for you
10/24/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: But I guess it‚Äôs also not the end of the world if we just see each other in December if we can‚Äôt find something that works for both of us so o shouldn‚Äôt be stressed
10/24/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: But anyway what‚Äôs on your schedule for the day?
10/24/19, 12:40 PM - Caleb: Booooooooo
10/24/19, 12:41 PM - Caleb: I mean you're right it wouldn't, but also I'm still super excited for this
10/24/19, 12:41 PM - Caleb: It's more complicated than ideal, but that ABSOLUTELY doesn't mean it's not worth figuring out
10/24/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: And my schedule is just classed and homework
10/24/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll work out, but I'm kinda sore from my run
10/24/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll run again
10/24/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Okay well feel free to try to figure it out
10/24/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Update some idiot has blocked someone in outside in the parking lot and the blocked in guy has just been HONKING HIS HORN CONTINUOUSLY it‚Äôs obnoxious
10/24/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: What's the earliest flight time you can do on that Friday
10/24/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Also I'm sorry, apparently bad, obnoxious drivers are just a universal thing
10/24/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: I have class until 4 so probably 6:30
10/24/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Okay, I feel like I've been kinda hesitant but haven't really voiced why, so I should probably do that
10/24/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: He got out don‚Äôt worry
10/24/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: ^^the driver
10/24/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: First off, I just want to say that I'm super excited and know that it will be a wonderful weekend
10/24/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: But I guess this is whats bothering me
10/24/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: First off, I've been spending a good bit of money recently and my bank account is really hurting, so a cheaper trip would be more favorable. I'd honestly be willing to pay for the trip to Barcelona because I think it would be worth it
10/24/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: But its just hard to pull the trigger on it right now
10/24/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: And honestly part of it is that the expenses are pretty one-sided with all flights and whatnot, which doesn't make me upset on its own, but it just kind of exasperates the fact that my bank is hurting
10/24/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And also I know you've mentioned being willing to pay more for the AirBnB or something, but I don't want to have to ask you to do that because it seems unfair and I don't want you to have that burden just because something is a little pricer for me
10/24/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Additionally, I think Belgium would be super fun, but so would Barcelona, its just that Belgium would be cheaper and I think a little more equal.
10/24/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Its like $120 for me, and $150 for you I thinkk
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And I think it would be super cute and festive near Christmas
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: But anyway, that's a lot to digest and I don't really even know if I'm looking for an answer
10/24/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: But I just figured it would be good to communicate what's going through my head
10/24/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Okay okay that‚Äôs 100% fair and I will try to get to Barcelona another way
10/24/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to make you feel like you have to hurt your bank like you really don‚Äôt. I genuinely hate spending money because I feel guilty about it so I get it totally.
10/24/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: And is that Brussels?  Or Bruges?  I found flights for you that is $38 but has you leaving at 6:55 am Sunday and there are no other options for what I‚Äôm looking at and one for me that‚Äôs 55‚Ç¨ leaving late Sunday
10/24/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Those are for Brussels
10/24/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Ahhhggggg
10/24/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Okay I'm starting to overthink things now
10/24/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: The pictures were some of Bruges, some of Brussels
10/24/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: I'm glad I let you know what I was thinking, but don't read into them too much. I think I just need a break to think about it on my own a little, and then I'll let you know
10/24/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: How are you?
10/24/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: No no it‚Äôs okay
10/24/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Worse comes to worse I could come to malm√∂ for like 44‚Ç¨
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: I think that‚Äôs the cheapest place in Sweden for me to fly into but we also could train somewhere else there if I flew there
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: But hey
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt worry about it
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm doing crypto
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: I love this Class
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt really want to take the final
10/24/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Midterm**
10/24/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs given us a giant study guide it‚Äôs just a lot to cram in my head rn
10/24/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: But take as much time as you need I don‚Äôt mean to rush you
10/24/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Whens your crypto midterm?
10/24/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: I feel like you're getting slapped all at once here
10/24/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Oh my god the voda phone charged me and put it in someone else‚Äôs account
10/24/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Now I have to go deal with this
10/24/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: This is why I haven‚Äôt had data
10/24/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: And tomorrow at 9am
10/24/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: I feel bad for whatever poor voda phone soul is about to have to deal with me
10/24/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: Oh sweet goodness
10/24/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: Someone's gonna get verbally slapped
10/24/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: How the heck does that even happen?
10/24/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: The lady must have put my phone number in wrong
10/24/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: My bill sheet says someone else‚Äôs name
10/24/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: She should have asked
10/24/19, 3:08 PM - Marianna: They asked the first time to make sure it was the right account
10/24/19, 3:09 PM - Marianna: Okay I won‚Äôt be able to respond WITHOUT WIFI OR DATA
10/24/19, 3:09 PM - Marianna: sorry not mad at you this just explains a lot and is frustrating
10/24/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: Hey no worries, I gotcha
10/24/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: Rant away, spare no details
10/24/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Oh gosh darn it
10/24/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: I'm trying to work things out, and the only thing its doing is making me want to do even more things with you
10/24/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Uncool brain
10/24/19, 3:17 PM - Caleb: I looked up 'Christmas' on TripAdvisor, and LITERALLY the top thing to come up is Tivoli in Copenhagen
10/24/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: Oh nevermind its actually #4 in the world for Christmas
10/24/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: _only_ #4
10/24/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: OKAY
10/24/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: I've made up my mind here
10/24/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: So
10/24/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: We're gonna do Barcelona, one way or another
10/24/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Basically, I think you would love Bruges. Its a beautiful, delightful, quaint, festive city that's straight out of a fairy tale.
10/24/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: HOWEVER, I'm also currently living in a city that's very quaint and hygge, and I've been to Bruges, and from my reading of it, you don't sound super excited about it which is okay. You seem pretty excited for Barcelona specifically
10/24/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: And I'll definitely get enough Northern European Christmas festivities, so I'd rather do something different and new and exciting with you, and also it sounds like you already have a good feeling for the city of Barcelona, so it would be easier to do more in a weekend than in a place neither of us really know
10/24/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: So-- Barcelona. Thoughts?
10/24/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôd like to but it is more expensive for you and I feel awful putting you in that spot. And would you rather do Bruges than Barcelona?
10/24/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Can I ask sarah and see if we can do Barcelona the next weekend and get back to you?
10/24/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Because I want to get to Barcelona and I think that‚Äôs clouding my thoughts
10/24/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want to dictate what we do especially if it‚Äôs logistically hard for you because of timing and pricing
10/24/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: And Bruges does look so cute and peaceful and it‚Äôs is more in between us
10/24/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: And Christmas markets!
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: That was more of the vibe I originally wanted
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Oh and vodaphone will get my money to my account in one day
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Which means yeah I have no data for another day because of their mistake
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Ah
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Well
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: And they weren‚Äôt totally sympathetic to that
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: Not very satisfied with them
10/24/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Thats nice theyll fix it eventually
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: ...eventually
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: But I guess I only have them for another month or so
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I'd say don't use them as your carrier in the states
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: Yeah but I leave Saturday morning so if it‚Äôs not back by then I might just not have data for vacation
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: ...Ah
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah that wouldn't be great
10/24/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: How long is your vacation?
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: Okay, heres the deal with Belgium
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: 8 days!
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: You've got chocolate
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: 4 countries!
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: You've got beer
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: And you've got beautiful sights
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: But thats it
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: AND WOAH
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: thats long
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: Oh wait stop you had me at chocolate and lost me at beer
10/24/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: Have you told me what your itinerary is?
10/24/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Yeah, thats why I'm still leaning to barcelona
10/24/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Because to me that sounds fun
10/24/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: But not if its not your thing
10/24/19, 3:38 PM - Marianna: Prague‚Äî>Berlin‚Äî>amsterdam‚Äî>Lucerne‚Äî>Budapest
10/24/19, 3:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk
10/24/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: Who's going?
10/24/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm willing to compromise because you have legit reasons Barcelona doesn‚Äôt really work
10/24/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: And I think I can convince Sarah to go
10/24/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Like you‚Äôd rather Bruges and Brussels right?
10/24/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: And also like I said, Belgium is beautiful, you can spend a full day just walking around and looking at things
10/24/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Like nothing else considered?
10/24/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: No, I'd rather do Barcelona
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: I mean, Italy would also be up there
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: But thats also ruled out
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: And Sarah and me for the first half and robin meets us in Amsterdam and stays with us for the rest and BETSY is meeting all of us in Lucerne!
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: BETSY
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs impossible and expensive to get to italy
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: (I looked)
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: Maybe Lee will tag along ahaha
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: No that‚Äôs maggie
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: ...ah
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: right
10/24/19, 3:40 PM - Caleb: I knew that
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Confession: I mix up your friends sometimes
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: Maggie used to live in Lucerne and is actually going this weekend
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: So do my parents?
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: So do I?
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: And well would you not want me to see if I can get to Barcelona with Sarah?
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm just gonna commit
10/24/19, 3:41 PM - Caleb: Lets Barcelona
10/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Hey
10/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: No
10/24/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: I could take all day and overthink this, but perfectly calculated decisions are overrated
10/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: If it doesn‚Äôt work for you
10/24/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôd have to leave Monday morning
10/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs much more expensive for you to get to
10/24/19, 3:43 PM - Marianna: And there are violent protests in the streets
10/24/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/24/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: Are you actually trying to talk me out of this right now
10/24/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: Let me talk to sarah before we decide?
10/24/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: Because I don‚Äôt want my want to go to Barcelona to make up have to do something
10/24/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: Because I don‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt want to go to Belgium and be hella hygge with me for a weekend
10/24/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: We can talk later or tomorrow too
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Sorry
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: See!
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: Let me talk to sarah
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs cheaper for me too
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: At least I thought that‚Äôs what I found
10/24/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Look
10/24/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: In the end, wherever we are is secondary
10/24/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: What I'm really looking forward to is just spending a weekend with you, and as that's the case, it'll be great no matter where we are
10/24/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: I just get this way when I'm frustrated and have stuff piling up on me, I basically flip into a mode where I just recklessly commit to things just to have them decided on and off my back
10/24/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: But anyway
10/24/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah
10/24/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: We'll figure something out, just let me know what Sarah says
10/24/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Okay but also I'd love to go to Southern Europe at some point, and I'd be willing to stay until Monday morning as long as I'm back for class I guess
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Okay so what we‚Äôll do
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll go to Barcelona
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: You go to Bruges
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: We FaceTime
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Kidding
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: And yo don‚Äôt do that
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Cool sounds perfect
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: I overestimate how I can come up with a perfect solution
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: And just tell myself it will work
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: But it won‚Äôt always and that‚Äôs okay
10/24/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: I blame physics
10/24/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Yeah but ya don‚Äôt want to
10/24/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: You might still have to to make Brussels work admittedly
10/24/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Anyway
10/24/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Thoughts on father John misty?
10/24/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: ?
10/24/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: And I liked Father John Misty's first album a lot
10/24/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: I Love You Honeybear was awesome
10/24/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: But then he got too sad and indie for me, and it all started sounding pretty much the same
10/24/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Idk, short musical shelf life I guess
10/24/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: The flight Sunday I found was 6am and that‚Äôs a no from me champ
10/24/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: I think he sounds so depressing
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: But maybe I‚Äôm just listening to the wrong stuff
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah, "too sad and indie" will do that
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: Yeaaaaah
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: There is a time and place but now is neither
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: I rarely want to listen to depressing music
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Which is part of why I liked his first album
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: It's way more cheerful and tells a story
10/24/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: Audrey had a cry playlist that I had to beg her not to play all the time because I was rarely in the mood
10/24/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Oh I've got a great crying Playlist
10/24/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: I made it for a friend though
10/24/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: And also I can't tell you the last time I used it
10/24/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Whyyyy
10/24/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Why is this a thing
10/24/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Do people _like_ crying?
10/24/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: You don't fight the emotions
10/24/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: When it rains, it's best to just let it pour and get it over with
10/24/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: You cray
10/24/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: If I‚Äôm crying it‚Äôs bad
10/24/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Just hope ya never see it and everything in life is good
10/24/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Also Chet baker just came on spotify for me
10/24/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Good Chet
10/24/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: Idk man
10/24/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: I think a good cry is healthy
10/24/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: I'm not saying I seek out crying, but if something happened and I need to cry, and its an okay place for me to cry, I'll cry
10/24/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: It doesn't happen very often
10/24/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: I think the last time was when my parents put Maggie down without warning me
10/24/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: WHAT
10/24/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
10/24/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: Awwwwwwww

10/24/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs not go to sad places rn
10/24/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: Unless you need to
10/24/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: I do believe it‚Äôs healthy to when you need to
10/24/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: I just don‚Äôt think personally it‚Äôs useful or helpful for me like I can handle it other ways maybe?
10/24/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: Idk
10/24/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/24/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: Tell me about something good from today

10/24/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Just about psychology and joker and her own experiences and stuff like that
10/24/19, 4:55 PM - Caleb: Its sort of a silly thing as a highlight, but I'm super happy about it
10/24/19, 4:55 PM - Caleb: Its just been kinda weird and tense with her recently because she's so rule heavy
10/24/19, 4:55 PM - Caleb: And it was just a fun, not tense conversation
10/24/19, 4:55 PM - Caleb: So that was nice
10/24/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Oh what class is rn

10/24/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Hey those are the best sometimes because it‚Äôs like woah you can be cool I should not be so hard on ya (at least that‚Äôs how it goes when it shows a different side of someone)

10/24/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Also yeah, what about her?
10/24/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt know her at all but she seemed so strict and series and low key intimidating
10/24/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: And then I was cs hw partners with her last semester
10/24/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: And it was so good

10/24/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: Oh lord
10/24/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: This is a worry I didn't need tonight
10/24/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: No no I doubt you need to worry
10/24/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Liam also doesn‚Äôt really stick with things besides his girlfriend

10/24/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Oh update they grafted a nerve in joeys hand and are hoping it will grow back

10/24/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/24/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: :))))
10/24/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: I may or may not be tipsy
10/24/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: I'll give you a hint that was a hint
10/24/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I knew the moment I saw the ‚Äúhey‚Äù followed by an ascii smiley with 4! (Not factorial just excitement) parentheses
10/24/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt even need the hint
10/24/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I hope you‚Äôre having a good night though!
10/24/19, 10:03 PM - Marianna: I wish I was tipsy rn
10/24/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/24/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: I wish you were here
10/24/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Two close pong games and no food isn't doing me favors though
10/24/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Dear Marianna
10/24/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Tonight I got drunk for absolutely nothing
10/24/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: Cassie and I slayed it
10/24/19, 10:25 PM - Caleb: And won all rounds of pong
10/24/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Hey I am proud of you
10/24/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Sincerely wish I was there too
10/24/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre _THRIVING_
10/24/19, 10:26 PM - Marianna: Sometimes you just need to get drunk on Thursday nights
10/24/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Less of a thing on Davidson‚Äôs campus I suppose
10/24/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Bar 42 never dies
10/24/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Unless it's any night but Thursday
10/24/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Then it literally doesn't exist
10/24/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Well
10/24/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Then it does die
10/24/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: I hate to poke holes in your proof here
10/24/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Excuse me
10/24/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: I think it's short enough to be a lemma
10/24/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Bruh
10/24/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Lemmas are just things mathmatitians come up with to use later in proofs
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Lemmas by themselves aren‚Äôt a thing
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Well maybe I'm tryna pr√∏ve something to you
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: So unless you established that bar 42 never dies as part of a larger proof...
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm listening
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: The √∏ happened on it's own
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Hear me out marianna
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Maybe
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Just _mayeb_
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: I'm cool :)))
10/24/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs drunk typing but _Danish_
10/24/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: It's a stretch but ima prove it

10/24/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Did you actually have to sign an NDA for even working at your last job? Or is it a personal preference
10/24/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Sorry if that's a rude/over the line question
10/24/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: You totally dont have to answer it
10/24/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: She said she suspected
10/24/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Belgium!

10/24/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Your sure aboot that
10/24/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: ?
10/24/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: And yeah but I can say I worked there technically I just choose not to. And I try not to talk about anything a lot to just not even risk getting close to anything I‚Äôm not allowed to talk about
10/24/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Yes!  Sarah and I are gonna try to go to Barcelona the next weekend
10/24/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: :*(
10/24/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: I want to do something you're excited aboot
10/24/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Ok I want to stay up and talk but i gotta sleep
10/24/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
10/24/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: Hey hey hey I never said I wasn‚Äôt excited to go to Belgium. It genuinely looks so peaceful and nice and that was the vibe I originally wanted for that weekend. So I want to go!
10/24/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: And goodnight!  Just finished my study guide so I have a little more studying of it and then it‚Äôs off to bed for me as well
10/24/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: Sleep well
10/25/19, 6:23 AM - Marianna: So I decided to go to bed last night and just wake up early to study and I‚Äôm currently hating myself for _that_ decision
10/25/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/25/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: I have 0 idea what part of that sounds good
10/25/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: What time is your midterm?
10/25/19, 7:25 AM - Caleb: Also good morning
10/25/19, 7:27 AM - Marianna: I did it all the time in high school
10/25/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: And surprisingly when I was quizzing myself this morning I knew a lot more of it than I did last night
10/25/19, 7:28 AM - Marianna: Osmosis as I slept or something.
10/25/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: And 9!  Ugh got to love it when they‚Äôre first thing
10/25/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs only a ~50 minute midterm so it won‚Äôt take long and then I‚Äôll maybe nap for 30-60 min before my next class
10/25/19, 7:29 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the dream anyway
10/25/19, 7:39 AM - Caleb: Yeah, sleep is wonderful for study
10/25/19, 7:39 AM - Caleb: Like whenever I get frustrated and feel like I'm not making progress, I try to shower, and if that doesn't work, I'll just sleep
10/25/19, 7:40 AM - Caleb: And then I guess I think about it while I sleep or something
10/25/19, 7:40 AM - Caleb: And I mean yeah then its out of the way though
10/25/19, 7:40 AM - Caleb: So
10/25/19, 7:40 AM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/25/19, 7:40 AM - Caleb: And HEY
10/25/19, 7:40 AM - Caleb: How are ya
10/25/19, 7:41 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm usually the kind of person to be like no!  I‚Äôm not going to sleep until it‚Äôs done or it‚Äôs totally studied for!
10/25/19, 7:41 AM - Marianna: But this is pass fail land
10/25/19, 7:41 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good
10/25/19, 7:42 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm on my way into school now so I can get there and study a bit
10/25/19, 7:42 AM - Marianna: And in the last few days I‚Äôve realized I need to buy a leather jacket
10/25/19, 7:42 AM - Marianna: Everyone wears them here and I like the looks
10/25/19, 7:44 AM - Caleb: Ah the good ol' leather jacket
10/25/19, 7:44 AM - Caleb: I'm sure I have mine somewhere, but it's not quite the same
10/25/19, 7:45 AM - Caleb: All these kids wearing faux motorcycle fashion, back in MY day....
10/25/19, 7:45 AM - Caleb: Jk, it's a good fall look ill give it to em
10/25/19, 7:45 AM - Caleb: In other news
10/25/19, 7:46 AM - Caleb: If someone makes like 3 instagram pictures using solely photos you've taken, and theres not one mention of you, do you have a right to be pissed
10/25/19, 7:47 AM - Caleb: Or I guess the real question is how irritated am I allowed to be
10/25/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs either a leather jacket or a Jean jacket I think and I think I‚Äôd look boxy in a jean jacket
10/25/19, 7:56 AM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll go shopping this afternoon
10/25/19, 7:57 AM - Marianna: And we‚Äôll that depends. Are they just for art photos or are they photos of them?
10/25/19, 8:00 AM - Marianna: CALEB I CAN SEE MY BREATH
10/25/19, 8:08 AM - Caleb: Woah I can't even imagine
10/25/19, 8:08 AM - Caleb: SooOoOooo cold
10/25/19, 8:08 AM - Caleb: So cold.
10/25/19, 8:08 AM - Caleb: There's like 2 photos of them
10/25/19, 8:08 AM - Caleb: And the rest are just art photosb
10/25/19, 8:08 AM - Caleb: Like maybe 7-8
10/25/19, 8:09 AM - Marianna: I know!  But the high is still 72 today don‚Äôt worry
10/25/19, 8:11 AM - Caleb: Oh thank goodness
10/25/19, 8:11 AM - Caleb: I was so worried you'd have to break out something drastic, _like a long sleeve_
10/25/19, 8:10 AM - Marianna: And okay so when I share Dropbox links with people, I generally say feel free to use any of you but if you want to use the art ones, ask me and I may say no because technically those are my property. You 100% could bring it up with them. Those are NOT their photos to share
10/25/19, 8:10 AM - Marianna: Is it a friend?  Or siddhesh?
10/25/19, 8:14 AM - Caleb: ... Siddhesh
10/25/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: But like if you look at any one of my friends Instagram, you find countless photos I‚Äôve taken. I‚Äôve also done headshots for people who want them every time we do photos before dances and things and sooooo many people use them for profile pictures and LinkedIn stuff which not all photography people may be comfy with. But it‚Äôs good to establish what is okay to use with people you take photos for in general
10/25/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: I know!  I‚Äôm still in shorts and a tshirt
10/25/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: Or you could throw a complaint to Instagram or whatever platform it is of creative property infringement or something
10/25/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: Or just shoot him a text
10/25/19, 8:16 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: And maybe don‚Äôt share a Dropbox link with him next time
10/25/19, 8:16 AM - Caleb: The funny thing is, I didn't
10/25/19, 8:16 AM - Caleb: The only person I shared the Dropbox link to is Spyros
10/25/19, 8:17 AM - Caleb: Siddhesh literally took my camera, took my memory card out, and put them on my laptop
10/25/19, 8:17 AM - Marianna: Ooooh yeah that‚Äôs for sure not okay
10/25/19, 8:17 AM - Caleb: Which is a whole 'nother degree of uncool
10/25/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like this kid
10/25/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: The good thing is it‚Äôs a story
10/25/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: So it will be gone in 24 hours
10/25/19, 8:18 AM - Caleb: Oh no there was also an actual post
10/25/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôd text him
10/25/19, 8:18 AM - Marianna: Tell him those are your properties
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: And wait how‚Äôd he get the photos then?
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: Or you know you could sue him
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Caleb: Okay yeah no
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Caleb: I honestly just wanted to rant
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Caleb: I'm just going to let it go
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: No that‚Äôs not col
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: ^^what he did
10/25/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: You can let it go
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Marianna: But it would be one thing if I t was a friend but it‚Äôs so not
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Oh I meant put them on HIS laptop
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Sorry
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd be kind of ticked if someone posted and made it look like they were their photos
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Marianna: Oh
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Marianna: So not cool
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: Yeah not really
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Caleb: It's fine though
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Marianna: Idk just maintain a better control of the photos next time?
10/25/19, 8:20 AM - Marianna: I know he was just taking your camera
10/25/19, 8:21 AM - Marianna: But no one gets their paws on andiamo and gets away with it
10/25/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: Again, I just wanted to rant about it
10/25/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: He has few enough followers that I might just end up using the same photos
10/25/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: He kinda pre-selected them for me
10/25/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: But yeah at that point my only option was smack Veev out of his hands, or just chew him out though
10/25/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: But again it's honestly fine
10/25/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: Okay I have to focus and cram real quick. Feel free to keep ranting but I‚Äôll probably talk to you after the midterm
10/25/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: I'll get over it in like an hour
10/25/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: HEY
10/25/19, 8:24 AM - Caleb: GOOD LUCK
10/25/19, 8:25 AM - Caleb: Let me know how it goes
10/25/19, 8:25 AM - Caleb: You got this
10/25/19, 8:26 AM - Caleb: (But also, the video I sent is a zinger lemme tell ya)
10/25/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: HEY
10/25/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: IM DONE
10/25/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: I think it went pretty well
10/25/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: There was one question where I was like ah yes I know what slide this diagram is on I can see it but I don‚Äôt remember the actual diagram
10/25/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: But other than that I feel pretty confident in it
10/25/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: And yes that video was
10/25/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: But now I‚Äôm gonna sleep in the lounge
10/25/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: HEY
10/25/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: Good job
10/25/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: I hate it when stuff like that happens though
10/25/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: I do that when I read, where I can remember exactly where on the page a quote is, and what the context is, but not the actual quote
10/25/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: OH
10/25/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: I apparently got a 95 on a midterm I thought I bombed
10/25/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: So yey
10/25/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: Update people were too loud in the lounge
10/25/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: So no sleep for mar
10/25/19, 10:20 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll nap this afternoon
10/25/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: But!  Thinking about Belgium‚Äîwould you want to stay in Brussels and do a day trip Saturday to Bruges?  And then Sunday morning (and a little Friday night), we can explore Brussels?  Or we can just do brussels all weekend. You know what would work better than I do
10/25/19, 10:22 AM - Marianna: And would you be able to look for an Airbnb if you have a free moment?
10/25/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Well honestly I'd still love to do Barcelona, I've thought about it and I'd be fine with staying until early Monday
10/25/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: But if we were to do Brussels, that was the plan
10/25/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: Friday and Sunday in Brussels, Saturday trip to Bruges
10/25/19, 11:13 AM - Caleb: But on the Barcelona thing, if I don't go now, I'll have never been in Southern Europe, and I don't know when I'll be back
10/25/19, 11:14 AM - Caleb: And like I said, I've been there and it's really pretty, but there's not tons to do besides eat, drink, walk around, and look at old museums
10/25/19, 11:31 AM - Caleb: Also it turns out I got a 97 not a 95
10/25/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: Update I have the strongest craving for Mac and cheese right now
10/25/19, 11:48 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: ... Wait a second did he just call me his photographer
10/25/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: IM FREE
10/25/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: it‚Äôs officially break
10/25/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: Well now sarah and I were planning on Barcelona the next weekend...
10/25/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: I think I would like to see brussels if that‚Äôs okay.
10/25/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: Like a relaxing weekend in a pretty place doesn‚Äôt sound like the worst thing with you
10/25/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: And yay!!! And well you kind of were...
10/25/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: GOSH DARN IT
10/25/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: Ah I shouldn't have said anything
10/25/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Well I hope you're ready for a weekend full of castles and chocolate and waffles and more chocolate
10/25/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: And hot chocolate
10/25/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: Ah I don‚Äôt mind not making a decision immediately but going back and worth puts me in a weird spot because I already told her plans had fallen through and she was pretty excited because she wants to go but you also now want to go so ahhhh
10/25/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
10/25/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: I thought Belgium was the plan
10/25/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: And so I got excited for Belgium with you
10/25/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Because this sounds heavenly
10/25/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: But if you want to, we could all go to Barcelona the next weekend instead?  Idk that doesn‚Äôt seem like a total op to on but that would get you both to Barcelona
10/25/19, 1:03 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôd have to clear that with her
10/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: No no no
10/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: I just figured you were more into Barcelona
10/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: I kinda figured that was the reason Belgium was the backup plan
10/25/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Honestly I'm super excited for either
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: Hey don't worry about it :)
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Well I had honeslty been kind of thinking Idk how you‚Äôd like Barcelona it‚Äôs not very hygge
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: Well I don't need everything to be hygge
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Barcelona seems more of a girls weekend kind of thing
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Yes but I also wanted a hygge vibe with you hence the desire to find a Christmas market
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: I'm 200% down
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: WHICH BELGIUM PROBAVBLY HAS RIGHT?!?!
10/25/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: Oh

10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness yes
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: Yay!
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs more of what I wanted with you
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Imagine a chocolate filled Christmas on steroids
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: OH
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: YUP
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: HEY
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: CAN WE PLEASE GO TO BELGIUM
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: With beautiful streets and cobblestones and canals
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Hmm
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: I'll think about it
10/25/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: It low key sounds like Italy
10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Like Venice with the canals
10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: I wonder how they Compare
10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: I can't find the thinking emoji
10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: But uh YES
10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: I mean I've also never been to Italy
10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: ü§î

10/25/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs italy
10/25/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: I would think you‚Äôd get there sometime in your life
10/25/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: At least for me, I‚Äôm very excited to have gone and to be going places this semester I wouldn‚Äôt have thought I‚Äôd end up necessarily
10/25/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Doesn't look super Italian
10/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: No no!  No more I want to see it in real life!
10/25/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Hope that's okay
10/25/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: And yes

10/25/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: I can get a flight soon after class, and then leave late Sunday night
10/25/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: What are things looking like for you?
10/25/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: Are you looking at flying into Brussels Charleroi?
10/25/19, 3:21 PM - Marianna: The airport
10/25/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: I could leave at 8:40 or 1:20
10/25/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/25/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: ^^at night
10/25/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: From or to Belgium
10/25/19, 3:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm flying into the other airport...
10/25/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: AH what
10/25/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: There are two
10/25/19, 3:24 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the only one cheap flights go to
10/25/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: ... You're sure about that
10/25/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: ?
10/25/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: I mean that's a shame but not a deal breaker
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: And I'm not about to be like "BOOK THE OTHER FLIGHT SO WE GET INTO THE SAME AIRPORT"
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: Ah it‚Äôs like an hour away
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: wHAT
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: Your airport is close
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: Well that's not super fun
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: This is how wizz air and Ryan air work
10/25/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: So they don‚Äôt have to pay a lot to go to the closer airports
10/25/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: I mean how much more is it
10/25/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: If you flew into the closer one
10/25/19, 3:26 PM - Marianna: I gotta google and see how to get from the airport
10/25/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Just like flight-cost wise
10/25/19, 3:27 PM - Marianna: $188 vs $55...
10/25/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: Well mines $120 for some reason
10/25/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: One sec
10/25/19, 3:27 PM - Marianna: Wait what
10/25/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: It's telling me that I can get a $37 flight but the mobile site isn't showing it

10/25/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: After the movie we went to Tivoli and just walked around
10/25/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Saw some really cool stuff
10/25/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: And then Derek dragged us into McDonald's
10/25/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: And now we're heading back to their place
10/25/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: And I'll grab my backpack and head home

10/25/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: It's like a hot apple cider, but red wine and Christmassy
10/25/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Hence it's the perfect mug wine
10/25/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/25/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre gonna do spiced wine Wednesday sometime here
10/25/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Ahhhh wine Wednesday

10/25/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Oh shoot my bad
10/25/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Just warning ya
10/25/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: I misunderstood

10/25/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mean to insult ya I‚Äôd love to have ya but tradition
10/25/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs our time to gossip and cry and get shitfaced either because we need it or we‚Äôre supporting someone else getting shitfaced on a Wednesday
10/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: No no I get it
10/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: It's okay
10/25/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: I promise
10/25/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: But They also don‚Äôt happen every week sometime so we can have our own wine wednesdays too!
10/25/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Or just mug wine dates
10/25/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd be very fine with you and mug wine and my heated blanket in bed instead of going out or just on a casual school night
10/25/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/25/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Lookin forward to it :)
10/25/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Lots of cute and fun things to do with you next semester
10/25/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Can't wait
10/25/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Missed voice call
10/25/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm ready to buy brussels tickets whenever you are!
10/26/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: Hello!
10/26/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: Sorry I was on the phone with my parents
10/26/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: I think the call dropped
10/26/19, 12:53 AM - Caleb: No ghosts were found
10/26/19, 12:53 AM - Caleb: I did make some friends however
10/26/19, 12:53 AM - Caleb: We're gonna go to Tivoli tomorrow
10/26/19, 12:55 AM - Caleb: Oh and they gave me homemade pumpkin bread
10/26/19, 12:55 AM - Caleb: It had dark chocolate chips in it, just like my mom makes
10/26/19, 12:55 AM - Marianna: OOOOOOH
10/26/19, 12:55 AM - Marianna: that sounds heavenly
10/26/19, 12:55 AM - Marianna: Why did they think they had ghosts?
10/26/19, 12:56 AM - Caleb: They heard a quiet gasp in their apartment because it's usually super noisy, and everyone left so it was oddly quiet
10/26/19, 12:56 AM - Caleb: And then someone asked about it, and they heard it ahaon
10/26/19, 12:56 AM - Caleb: Again*
10/26/19, 12:56 AM - Caleb: So they all ran out
10/26/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: And they ran to a random door, which ended up being mine, knocked, and then I basically just cleared the coast and put on a movie to clear the silence
10/26/19, 1:02 AM - Marianna: Ha
10/26/19, 1:02 AM - Marianna: Knight in shining armor if I‚Äôve ever seen one
10/26/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: Ha
10/26/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: Does this make me prince charming?
10/26/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: Also, how's this look for a more budget option
10/26/19, 1:03 AM - Caleb: https://abnb.me/95ytBnvl50
10/26/19, 1:04 AM - Caleb: It's an A+ location and really cheap
10/26/19, 1:04 AM - Caleb: It's only one picture though which is not very comforting
10/26/19, 1:07 AM - Caleb: https://abnb.me/3SFttzNl50
10/26/19, 1:07 AM - Caleb: Here's another one
10/26/19, 1:10 AM - Caleb: (just answer these at some point after you're done, or I'll actually just email them all to you so you're not flooded)
10/26/19, 1:19 AM - Caleb: Alright, I'm gonna throw on Pallendrome Hutches and go to bed now
10/26/19, 1:19 AM - Caleb: Goodnight!
10/26/19, 1:20 AM - Marianna: Me too
10/26/19, 1:20 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sad because I‚Äôm leaving pig here this week
10/26/19, 1:20 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll check them or whatever you send me tomorrow!
10/26/19, 1:20 AM - Marianna: I have to be on a bus to the airport in 6 hours yippee
10/26/19, 1:21 AM - Marianna: I did not do today well but that‚Äôs okay
10/26/19, 1:21 AM - Marianna: Goodnight!!!
10/26/19, 6:20 AM - Marianna: Oh goodmorning
10/26/19, 6:20 AM - Marianna: We gonna sleep on this flight for suuuuure
10/26/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: I like the second Airbnb first is a little weird that it has one picture and no reviews. Second seems cute and central and reasonable!
10/26/19, 9:09 AM - Marianna: Update we are on the PROP JET to Prague!
10/26/19, 9:24 AM - Caleb: Good morning!
10/26/19, 9:25 AM - Caleb: Looking at that 1:21-6:20 transition hurts my soul a little bit
10/26/19, 9:25 AM - Caleb: That's exciting though, it's been a long time since I've been on a turbo prop
10/26/19, 9:25 AM - Caleb: They're lowkey fun
10/26/19, 9:27 AM - Caleb: And do you want me to go ahead and book the second one then and you can pay me?
10/26/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: The only thing is that it has a shared bathroom I think
10/26/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: That works with me if that‚Äôs okay with you!
10/26/19, 10:39 AM - Marianna: If you don‚Äôt want to put it on your card, I can do it probably
10/26/19, 10:39 AM - Marianna: And hello from Prague!!!
10/26/19, 10:48 AM - Marianna: Oh and my prof accepted my comp bio research paper topic!  (He shot down Sarahs first one which sucks)
10/26/19, 10:48 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to come up with another one
10/26/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: Hello! How's Prague?
10/26/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: And that's awesome! What's your topic?
10/26/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: I might need to cancel and get a different spot
10/26/19, 10:57 AM - Caleb: Unless you're fine with that
10/26/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah I‚Äôm good with whatever you think would be good. If the far away is linked with public transit that shouldn‚Äôt be too bae
10/26/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Bad**
10/26/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Yeah I'm gonna get up, shower, and work it out
10/26/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: And We haven‚Äôt actually gotten to the city yet.
10/26/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: This is what I get for trying to do work in bed
10/26/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Turns out josh and his mom were on our flight and even in the row in front of us!  So we snagged a ride in the cab they have ordered
10/26/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: WOAH what are the odds
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Study abroad is crazy, such a tiny world
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs nice not having to figure out how to go there yet
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: Yeah really
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: The flight was one thing but _the row in front of us?_
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: There's uncanny
10/26/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: And then there's _that_
10/26/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: So what's your plan for the day?
10/26/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: We spent 2 hours planning our week itinerary last night
10/26/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: But elliot lannon whos a senior at davidson studied here last fall semester so he sent like ‚Äúwhat to do in 24 hours in Prague‚Äù that we‚Äôre kind of relying on today
10/26/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: Ah well that's nice
10/26/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: What's on the list?
10/26/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: Also I'm gonna go ahead and book a different AirBnB
10/26/19, 11:41 AM - Caleb: I'll send you some ones I find and let you take a quick look
10/26/19, 11:42 AM - Caleb: Note to self: use the desktop website for AirBnB
10/26/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: https://abnb.me/TiHhBnG550
10/26/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: How's that look
10/26/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: It's a tad more expensive, but looks nice and is 20 minutes from downtown Brussels
10/26/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah I never do any ordering on my phone
10/26/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: And that works with me!
10/26/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Now we are off to find lunch
10/26/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Booked, it worked out to $43.81 a person
10/26/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Psst
10/26/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Hey you

10/26/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Oof
10/26/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: And you don't have your laptop either, so you can't just throw them on there
10/26/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Camera to phone to Dropbox might be necessary tonight
10/26/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Also WHAT
10/26/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: How does this keep happening
10/26/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: How small can Europe really be
10/26/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Also that's rough about the metro, have you been getting around okay?
10/26/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Also I 100% hear Hanne and her boyfriend showering together in the bathroom that I use
10/26/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: First off, quite uncomfy
10/26/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Second off, double standard, come on now
10/26/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Unhygge and unfair
10/26/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: Shoot her a text
10/26/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: Be like hi so I know we technically don‚Äôt have a rule but were you and your boyfriend just showering in the bathroom I use?  That kind of makes me very uncomfortable because that‚Äôs a communical space
10/26/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: DO IT
10/26/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: And yeah weve been getting around fine
10/26/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Just napped for a little bit
10/26/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: But now we have to get up for dinner but I don‚Äôt want to
10/26/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Nah theres not gonna be a text
10/26/19, 6:19 PM - Caleb: Its gonna be face to face
10/26/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: What really
10/26/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Texting about issues is for cowards who fear confrontation
10/26/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: ...ISNT that what she did?
10/26/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: If I can't look her in the eye and bring it up, I don't deserve to have it be a grievance
10/26/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah, but do I want to be on her level?
10/26/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs one way of looking at it
10/26/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: But like if there‚Äôs no rule against it ? If she just likes rules then she might not see an issue here
10/26/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: Then we're gonna set a rule
10/26/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: I feel like no sex in a communal space shouldn't need to be one
10/26/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: But hey if it does, we can gladly make it one
10/26/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Well you technically don‚Äôt know they were having sex in the shower
10/26/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: But yeah seems reasonable
10/26/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: Oh goodness yeah if they weren't having sex then it's totally fine then
10/26/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: But really, I'm just gonna stick to the facts and what I know, and have a very uncomfortable conversation with her
10/26/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: I just don't like feeling like I'm a guest in my own flat
10/26/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre in a weird mood then
10/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Not many people wish for uncomfortable conversations
10/26/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: Well
10/26/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: It'll be uncomfortable for her
10/26/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: I'll be fine
10/26/19, 6:26 PM - Caleb: Comfort is a choice, ya know
10/26/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Interesting
10/26/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: So anyway enough venting
10/26/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: How's your day been?
10/26/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Eh it‚Äôs okay
10/26/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs DRAMATIC
10/26/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: and uncomfy I‚Äôm sorry
10/26/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: But also it happens I guess
10/26/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: But you can stop it if you‚Äôd like
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's honestly not really about the showering thing anyway
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre going to dinner now
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Deep down I know that
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Eh that‚Äôs fine too
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: It's just about feeling like a second-rate resident of my own house
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: But that's something not worth getting into
10/26/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Not with a month left
10/26/19, 6:38 PM - Caleb: And that's cool! Where to for dinner!
10/26/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah but it‚Äôs a valid thing to let someone you‚Äôre living with know something was uncool
10/26/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: And some place right down the street from our hostel!  Nice but kind of empty currently
10/26/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Miss Budapest already
10/26/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>

10/26/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Oh pizza is good
10/26/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: And friends is my ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad and need to laugh show‚Äù so I save watching it for those occasions when I need to cheer up
10/26/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm still on season 1

10/27/19, 9:02 AM - Caleb: Well
10/27/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Well unless you‚Äôre talking about like the b side of a tape

10/27/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: I'll let you know how I'm feeling on top of the London eye
10/27/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: I'll take Veev up with me
10/27/19, 3:38 PM - Marianna: Ah if only I could go to the top of the London eye with you üòâ
10/27/19, 3:38 PM - Marianna: Kidding but please do take lots and lots of pictures
10/27/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: Wait is being at the top of the London eye a thing
10/27/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: Didn't know that
10/27/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: I honestly may just send out a mass email to my friends and family when I get back because I‚Äôm gonna have so many photos and stories to tell
10/27/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: Not that I know of but you had mentioned Ferris wheels before yeah?  Idk how serious you were but whatever
10/27/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: Please please be that american tourist who takes a billion photos of police boxes and old phone booths
10/27/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: AH
10/27/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: Yes
10/27/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: Yes I did
10/27/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: May or may not be blushing
10/27/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: And don't worry
10/27/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: Woo and I have photos covered
10/27/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: HA got you
10/27/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: I enjoy making you blush idk why it just kinda cracks me up
10/27/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: And good
10/27/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt know woo did photos too
10/27/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah, woos great
10/27/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: He's got a Fuji mirror less and we trade off sometimes
10/27/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: He's the one that took my current Instagram profile image
10/27/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: Oh and by the way I have Instagram deleted, so I'm not gonna see anything, but if you wanna spam me I'll enjoy it when I reinstall eventually
10/27/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: Ooooh okay is his film or still digital?  I guess it must be digital if that‚Äôs what he took a profile picture with but I don‚Äôt know anything about mirrorless or anything besides my camera honestly
10/27/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very impressed with you ability to dive in and do all the research you did
10/27/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: What are you guys doing today in London?
10/27/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's sort of what I do
10/27/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: Whenever I get into a new hobby, I absolutely dive in as much as I can and kinda fixate on it for a few weeks
10/27/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: And then I've got a pretty good depth of knowledge and just coast with it and find a new thing that interests me
10/27/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: It's why I have a ton of random hobbies that I've gotten pretty far into
10/27/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: It's like a flat road that has a ton of really deep potholes in it, if that makes sense
10/27/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: No that‚Äôs makes no sense but I think I get it without the analogy

10/27/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: All of yo hobbies I‚Äôve heard about are cool though
10/27/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Idk though, I still think you're a really interesting person
10/27/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: Well thank ya thank ya very much
10/27/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: OH boy well you're gonna hear some kinda uncool ones

10/27/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: As a hobby
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Ah yes but I‚Äôve heard about this one
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs col
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Nothing I think I‚Äôd ever get into
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: But cool
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Mechanical keyboard repair?
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Very artistic
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Oh
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Weird
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: But makes sense
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Ha it's more out of necessity
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah wait you do a lot of fixing things hobbies
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: I blame Calvin for that one
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Motorcycles and mechanic work
10/27/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: That's a fun one
10/27/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Lots of frustration and a big money/space requirement though
10/27/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/27/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Did you lose money on the bike like did you put more in than you got out when you sold it?
10/27/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Well I guess you also did it for fun and you got the skill so it might have balanced out in different ways
10/27/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: I feel like Calvin is the reason you got a lot of these hobbies
10/27/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Eh
10/27/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: The bike was about break even honestly
10/27/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Did I tell you the story of when I sold it though?
10/27/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: And I'd say Calvin is really only responsible for keyboards and computers
10/27/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: And partially cameras
10/27/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Even though he was saying I shouldn't do it
10/27/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: And the nice thing about having a billion random hobbies is that 95% of the time I can find some common ground to talk about with people
10/27/19, 4:18 PM - Marianna: No what‚Äôs the story about selling it?
10/27/19, 4:18 PM - Marianna: And whyd calvin say you shouldn‚Äôt do cameras!
10/27/19, 4:18 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way
10/27/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: But what did we have in common before you picked up photography halfway through the summer?
10/27/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: I mean DAVIDSON
10/27/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: My phone keeps capitalized DAVIDSON idk why
10/27/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: Maybe it‚Äôs just used to me being excited about it
10/27/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: But I feel like we had stuff we talked about even before photography came up
10/27/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: Well
10/27/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: We talked about reading a lot
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: How few movies we'd seen
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Very similar friends
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Amusement parks
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: CS
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Math
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Notes
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Coffee
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Travel
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Davidson and parties and Ben Heuser
10/27/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Passion about the little things
10/27/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Food
10/27/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Good call prefacing it with "Don't take this the wrong way" though
10/27/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: I think there's a lot there, and I could keep going
10/27/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/27/19, 4:36 PM - Caleb: Not super London but very cool
10/27/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: Oh! And he said he was disillusioned because having a big camera is nice, but a pain to carry around and move and get lenses for
10/27/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: And smartphones are great
10/27/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Okay yeah you are right we did have things to talk about
10/27/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Notes were definitely a big one
10/27/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: I love that ben Heuser made it on there though
10/27/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs very true
10/27/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: And that is a very cool photo
10/27/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: And yeah I see Calvin‚Äôs point
10/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs why I kind of didn‚Äôt do photography as much when I‚Äôm at school because it‚Äôs sooo much to take out and then get photos off of like phones are much more convenient. But I always break it out for dances and things and I really enjoy taking pictures of my friends for that and getting my photos from them because everyone looks so good and the camera makes all the photos of everyone looking so good so good
10/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: And also my phone is crap
10/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Like camera wise
10/27/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: I love it other than that and it‚Äôs inability to keep charged
10/27/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm getting a new phone in like 2 weeks but idk I don‚Äôt love the facial recognition still and no headphone jack (not that I really use the headphone jack to be honest)
10/27/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre in Germany!
10/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: WOOHOO
10/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Welcome to Germany
10/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Have a good time
10/27/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: But yeah I feel like there's a good bit in common
10/27/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: It's just hilarious that 0 of those things are non-hungsrian movies
10/27/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: And thats why I love Veev! He's super easy to throw in a backpack and just carry around easily
10/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Yes I love that a Hungarian film and princess and the frog are the movies we‚Äôve seen together too
10/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Although tbh it makes sense if you remember it was me that picked them...
10/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: And yes he is nice like that
10/27/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Andi is a little bit more particular and needs lots of room
10/27/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: Oh and I‚Äôm gonna nap on the bus and I‚Äôll listen to the album when I do!
10/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Yayyy
10/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Also yeah, gotta say they were good movies though
10/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: Idk if I can handle the pressure of picking movies
10/27/19, 5:35 PM - Caleb: I've got a couple on the list we need to watch though
10/27/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: Also, have you ever had Nandos
10/27/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: Or heard of it
10/27/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôd consider myself a movie person so I think I have good taste
10/27/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: And yes I want to see some of the ones you love too!
10/27/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: I think we can arrange some movie nights when we‚Äôre living 5 minutes from each other
10/27/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôve heard of it
10/27/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: And we have something called nandos peri peri in Maryland but I don‚Äôt know if they are the same thing or even related
10/27/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: I'd agree with that
10/27/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: All movies have been pretty enjoyable
10/27/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhh yeah, I can see it now
10/27/19, 5:42 PM - Caleb: Fluffy blankets
10/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Hot chocolate
10/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Cold weather
10/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Snacks
10/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: And a movie
10/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Good time
10/27/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Is it like an African chicken place?
10/27/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Idk I‚Äôve never actually gone...
10/27/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: And I feel like that‚Äôs how you always describe hanging out next semester
10/27/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Not that any of it is a bad thing
10/27/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/27/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: It's like an ideal Friday night before going out
10/27/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: I've got lots of things I want to do, not just that I swear
10/27/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: It's just that immediately it's going to be winter, which hinders a lot of them
10/27/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Although if it snows you betcha we're sledding or something fun in the snow
10/27/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Have you figured out if you have a single or are gonna live with lee yet?
10/27/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: Not yet
10/27/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: I figured it doesn't really matter if I email or not
10/27/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: But I'll do that tonight if you want
10/27/19, 6:23 PM - Marianna: Oh man let me tell you if we do movie night and then plan on going out I may not make it
10/27/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: A marianna at rest and in a comfy spot tends to stay at rest in the comfy spot
10/27/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Eh I don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs not really any of my business but shouldn‚Äôt you figure it out for lee?
10/27/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: AH right
10/27/19, 6:29 PM - Caleb: I just emailed Hannah and I'll let you know
10/27/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/27/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: Do you think It‚Äôs weird that I associate Frank Sinatra with Christmas time
10/27/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôm listening to Frank rn and I‚Äôm like I want cold weather and sweaters and pine trees and hot cider and Christmas cookies
10/27/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: I think that is the least weird association I've ever heard
10/27/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: I've definitely heard weirder at least
10/27/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm absolutely gonna ask for a prime lens for Christmas
10/27/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: They're SO NICE
10/27/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Oh okay good
10/27/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so strange to me like most of his music isn‚Äôt overly christmassy
10/27/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: I think he has like one Christmas album maybe
10/27/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: And yeah I LOVE using my moms

10/27/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: With the swirly bokeh
10/27/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: And another is a 38 prime

10/27/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: It looks very very good
10/27/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: I had like half a sandwich for dinner
10/27/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: It was a good sandwich
10/27/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: Thing one of my friends just said:
10/27/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: "when you dive deep into it, getting vaccinated is so hygge"
10/27/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: Um no
10/27/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: May I ask logic
10/27/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: Was there logic presented in this argument
10/27/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah

10/27/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Oh
10/27/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get drunk off of one drink
10/27/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: We think we‚Äôre gonna do a pub crawl tomorrow

10/27/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Smol mar
10/27/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: But it was a short drink
10/27/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: Like a smol drink
10/27/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: The ratio was alarming but the volume wasn‚Äôt if that makes any sense
10/27/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: And now it is bedtime so we can get up and see the world tomorrow!  Goodnight!  Have fun and be safe and I‚Äôll talk to ya tomorrow!
10/27/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: Ok! Goodnight! I'll let you know when I'm back home

10/28/19, 8:27 AM - Caleb: Bummer
10/28/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: Weather is surprisingly nice! I was getting by last night with a flannel and long pants
10/28/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: It's fairly sunny in London, but a little brisk
10/28/19, 8:28 AM - Caleb: How's Berlin?
10/28/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: Shockingly cold last night
10/28/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: Not too bad in my coat and big scarf but not too great either
10/28/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so pumped to actually see Berlin today
10/28/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre going to a illusion museum this morning
10/28/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: WOAH that sounds cool gotta say
10/28/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: If you don't come back and do some magic, I'm gonna be very sad
10/28/19, 12:43 PM - Caleb: Update its been a wild 5 minutes
10/28/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: No no it was like brain games stuff
10/28/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: You watched brain games right?
10/28/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: And what happened?
10/28/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre getting pizza for lunch I‚Äôm PUMPED
10/28/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: this afternoon we‚Äôre going to the stasi museum
10/28/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: Well
10/28/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Our tour guide was talking about Guy Fawkes, and how he was caught and excited
10/28/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Executed*
10/28/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: And she was talking about how he was hung, drawn, and quartered
10/28/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: And so she gets to the part where the executioner cuts him open alive and pulls out his besting heart, and the last thing Guy Fawkes sees is the last beat of his heart
10/28/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: And Derek LITERALLY faints and falls down
10/28/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: And so we sit him down and I'm making sure he's okay, but it was wild
10/28/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: He was ghost white and I was making sure he didn't hit his head
10/28/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: And once we made sure he was fine, LITERALLY 30 seconds later there's a car crash 20 feet from us
10/28/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: Wild stuff man
10/28/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/28/19, 1:59 PM - Caleb: «ùuo…•d«ùl«ù á
10/28/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Is Derek just squeamish about those things?
10/28/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: Or were you just in like a haunted like bad luck spot?
10/28/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: And I like the telephone although I have no idea how you typed that
10/28/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: You know I'm not really sure
10/28/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: He's just a fragile person I suppose
10/28/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: Also, we're now having a "Science tea party" and it's delightful
10/28/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Ah poor sensitive Derek
10/28/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: And what is a science tea party

10/28/19, 9:09 PM - Marianna: Good!
10/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Illusion museum was small but good
10/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Got a lot of cool photos out of it honestly
10/28/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: And stasi was a little bit underwhelming but just being in the old headquarters was a little crazy
10/28/19, 9:11 PM - Marianna: They decided to preserve the officers floor and offices as they were when the people overtook the office and said no you can‚Äôt spy on us anymore
10/28/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: And then my card got declined at dinner which was a little scary but I checked and there aren‚Äôt any wrong charges and there‚Äôs still balance left so I‚Äôm hoping it was just a fluke. We‚Äôll see if it works tomorrow
10/28/19, 9:12 PM - Marianna: Now Sarah and I are drinking cocktails in the hostel bar
10/28/19, 9:27 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah thats a little nerve-wracking
10/28/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: I'm sure it's fine
10/28/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Probably just a card type error
10/28/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: And is it gonna be a drunk night for ya
10/28/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: Because I'm tipsy already
10/28/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: #just vacation things
10/28/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: No not likely
10/28/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: Sober Marianna‚Äôs fun too
10/28/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: Just remember that
10/28/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Because sometimes my friends remind me they like drunk marianna too much but sober marianna needs some love and no pressure to drink sometimes too
10/28/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm happy for you
10/28/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: We are gonna do a bar crawl tomorrow
10/28/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: So get ready for tTHAT
10/28/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Hey
10/28/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: I just want to let you know that I really like all Mariannas
10/28/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: Especially sober Marianna
10/28/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: She's the one I got coffee with on the first date
10/28/19, 9:33 PM - Caleb: And boy oh boy did I think she was a special one
10/28/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Drunk Marianna is fun too, but mostly because she says EXACTLY what is on her mind with 0 hesitation
10/28/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: But it's a yin and yang thing
10/28/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Not that I need drunk Marianna
10/28/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Sober Marianna is delightful enough
10/28/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: You still haven‚Äôt met cranky marianna
10/28/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: Sarah met her last week
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Well
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Will I?
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Only if you wake me up before my alarms when I have alarms set
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Or maybe some other instances
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: Maybe when the stress hits next semester
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs not too bad I promise
10/28/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Just don‚Äôt take her attitude personally
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: You met stressed Caleb once
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: With definitely inconvenient timing
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: (the AirBnB thing with China)
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Honestly the whole thing with China though and though was stressed Caleb
10/28/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Planning, writing, visa, flights, hotel, and everything
10/28/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Sorry you had to deal with him
10/28/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: I hope it wasn't too bad
10/28/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: And well I will point out that sober marianna is the one that got the courage up to ask you out officially and all soooooo she can also say what‚Äôs on her mind but it just terrifies her so she usually just lets drunk marianna handle saying whatever she wants
10/28/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: ALSO WE JUST FOUND AUDREYS EX ON TINDER IN BERLIN
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Honestly I'm still just blown away you asked me out
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: That's a first for me
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Props to you, you're a ballsy one
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Break those stereotypes
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: Go you
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Yes but I didn‚Äôt mind you being stressed I just don‚Äôt know how to help stressed caleb yet
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: (gender norms? Stereotypes? Wherever)
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: He calmed down eventually
10/28/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: And yeah it was a first for me but honeslty not out of character I think
10/28/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I don't either
10/28/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: And I like that about you
10/28/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I like a lot of things about you, and that just made me really sure of it
10/28/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm drunk and rambling

10/28/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: OH did you mean catch up
10/28/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: I feel like you meant catch up
10/28/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Or just catch you in drinking
10/28/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: So essentially catch up
10/28/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: But then again we know what happened the last time I tried to catch up to anyone
10/28/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Oh and I‚Äôm drinking rum

10/29/19, 9:42 AM - Marianna: Bolth
10/29/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: And woah that‚Äôs super cool
10/29/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre doing a whole loop of wwii stuff today
10/29/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: Seeing monuments and things
10/29/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: Remind me to tell you about the Halloween Davidson drama when we talk next
10/29/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: When do you get home from London?
10/29/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Friday night I think
10/29/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Also will do!
10/29/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: I feel like there's always some sort of friend drama around the holidays
10/29/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Also, is it weird that I'm not sure if I like my job or not
10/29/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: I'm sitting in all these startups and it's like, eh, they're not really more exciting either
10/29/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: Is this like a quarter life crisis
10/29/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Maybe I should get out of my comfort zone, that's probably the right answer
10/29/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: ANYWAY how are you, how's your day going
10/29/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not even friend drama it‚Äôs just straight up davidson drama
10/29/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: And what do you mean you don‚Äôt like your job
10/29/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre too young to dislike your job
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: What made you think this if you‚Äôre surrounded with startups that also don‚Äôt look cool?
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good!
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: I don't think it's an "I dislike my job"
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre at lunch now
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: Got soup
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: And a cappuccino
10/29/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: And a sandwich
10/29/19, 2:27 PM - Caleb: It's a "I feel unambitious and stuck in my comfort zone and want to do something new and exciting but also don't want to sacrifice my current gig which is the best possible thing for me in the long run"
10/29/19, 2:27 PM - Caleb: Also OH boy have you been following recent Davidson Halloween drama
10/29/19, 2:27 PM - Caleb: Wild stuff
10/29/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: Yeah I feel like that‚Äôs normal. I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it. You also should feel free to apply other places (but you don‚Äôt need to) in case you want to see what else you could do next summer?
10/29/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: And wait are we talking about the same thing
10/29/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: The inmate costumes?
10/29/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah
10/29/19, 2:38 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd heard because I‚Äôve gotten all the news from it from Instagram posts
10/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah Nathan showed me
10/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Like
10/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: It's one thing to have a vaguely racist costume
10/29/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: That's like one level of not okay
10/29/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: And then there's planning the costume with friends, executing it, going the whole night with it, and making an Instagram post, and STILL not realizing it's not okay
10/29/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: That's just a mind boggling level of thoughtlessness
10/29/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: I gotta say I also had a qualm with the callout too, mostly with the "why do you think racism is a personality trait" because that's really overreaching
10/29/19, 2:47 PM - Caleb: But hey, it wouldn't be a shitshow without some blind, overreaching accusations, would it?
10/29/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: I saw their post and was like is that allowed?  Or if wearing their hair like that kind of racist?
10/29/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Very glad to microagressions page informes me that it was indeed racist
10/29/19, 3:32 PM - Marianna: I feel kind of bad for the callout too but it‚Äôs good to let EVERYONE know about the issue
10/29/19, 3:33 PM - Marianna: But where did you see that phrase?  I saw brys post as BSC president on the microagression page but maybe I just missed that phrase
10/29/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Hallo back in the hostel for about and hour before dinner and pub crawl!
10/29/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah, but I'll admit that I have a bit of sympathy for her
10/29/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Like, that's absolutely going to haunt her already
10/29/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: I think attacking her on top of it is unneeded
10/29/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: It was on the wildcat watch or whatever
10/29/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: Also I'm gonna have to tell you about the last three hours at some point
10/29/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: It's aneurism enducing
10/29/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: But also redeeming at the end
10/29/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: So yey
10/29/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: And I'm very very very very very glad I'm not an anthropology student
10/29/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: HAVE FUN THOUGH
10/29/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Send pubdates
10/29/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Like pupdates, but from a pub crawl
10/29/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Be safe pls
10/29/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Wildcat watch?
10/29/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Oh no
10/29/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: I hope it wasn‚Äôt actually aneurism inducing
10/29/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Vacations supposed to be relaxing caleb. You haven‚Äôt had a very relaxing time yet. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going wrong!
10/29/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Doing**
10/29/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Kidding I‚Äôll blame that it‚Äôs a school trip
10/29/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: And I locked up andiamo for the night and I‚Äôm kind of a nervous wreck I hate not having him ah
10/29/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna forget that and enjoy the night
10/29/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like dropping my kid off at the babysitters
10/29/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Except the babysitter is a locked box in the middle of a city
10/29/19, 6:18 PM - Marianna: Ah
10/29/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: No worrying!
10/29/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: Yeah don't worry it wasn't actually that bad

10/30/19, 1:12 AM - Caleb: It's what friends do for each other

10/30/19, 1:15 AM - Marianna: But she did say that Mia noted that she and o were very different people and I take that as mia doesn‚Äôt particularly care for me and hoenstly that‚Äôs comforting

10/30/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: Science museum sounds cool too
10/30/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: OHHH
10/30/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: right I forgot
10/30/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: Yeah
10/30/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: And we‚Äôre gonna go to one more museum this morning and then to Amsterdam!
10/30/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: I was trying to round up everyone by like 1:15, but no one was heading out until 1:45
10/30/19, 9:32 AM - Marianna: And man I‚Äôve had a good amount of vanilla macchiatos in my day but the one I‚Äôm currently drinking is definitely one of the best
10/30/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: And then getting back was a challenge
10/30/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: OOOOOOO
10/30/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD
10/30/19, 9:35 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: Oh that looks so cool
10/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: We got to ride the above ground and kind of above city metro home last night and I loved seeing the dark city wizz by (especially because I was also a little tipsy which added a bit of wonder and fantasticness to it)
10/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: And yes
10/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Very very good
10/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Just went to a cool museum
10/30/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: Just the little snippets of this city and like what used to stand there or what the purpose of a building was after the war is so fascinating
10/30/19, 12:41 PM - Caleb: Dear mar
10/30/19, 12:41 PM - Caleb: I'm currently in the coolest, most impressive museum that I've ever seen or dreamed of
10/30/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: You'd love this so much
10/30/19, 12:47 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 12:48 PM - Caleb: I'm pretty sure your head would actually just explode if you walked in here
10/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: Looks so cool
10/30/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: Having quite the different moment over here in Germany
10/30/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: We took the train to the airport and we technically didn‚Äôt have the right tickets so I was like Sarah maybe we should get tickets and she was like nah so of course we got ticketed and had to pay 60‚Ç¨
10/30/19, 12:57 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm flustered about to cry
10/30/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey
10/30/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: It's okay
10/30/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: It doesn't mean anything
10/30/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: You're just as wonderful a person as you were before the ticket, and it's only 60‚Ç¨
10/30/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: If that's the worst thing to happen during the trip, then it'd a pretty good trip
10/30/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: How's the rest of your day been?
10/30/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: Good
10/30/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: Museum this morning was good
10/30/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: She ended up paying most of my fine but I feel bad she shouldn‚Äôt have to pay 100 bucks for the mistake
10/30/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: We should have just bought tickets
10/30/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: We were just dumb
10/30/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: I like rules for a reason
10/30/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: And now I‚Äôm gonna be all worried about our bags being oversized as carry inside
10/30/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Ons **
10/30/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Ah
10/30/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: I will be happy when we get to Amsterdam
10/30/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just a little high strung rn
10/30/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: So tell me about your day?  Please?  What cool science stuff did you see?
10/30/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: WELL
10/30/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: We saw a bunch of stuff about the automated driving
10/30/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: And boaty mcboatface
10/30/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: And drones
10/30/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: And all sorts of AI stuff for navigation and communication
10/30/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: And then we left

10/30/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: Looking at all sorts of "acquired" artifacts
10/30/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: And it's SUPER COOL
10/30/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: Photos still syncing with my phone so I'll send more when they get here
10/30/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: I did see boaty mcboatface
10/30/19, 1:37 PM - Marianna: I forget what was boatys purpose again?
10/30/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: And what do you mean my ‚Äúacquired‚Äù?
10/30/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: By**
10/30/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: He was an artic glaciology ship
10/30/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: Lots of research
10/30/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: And the UK put his name up for voting and submissions
10/30/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Ooooh what a good pot
10/30/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: And the internet delivered
10/30/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Boy**
10/30/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Yes I remember that time
10/30/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Wait how long ago was that?  Was that high school?

10/30/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: I LOVE THE PERSON AND THE TOAD ONE
10/30/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: OR CROCODLE
10/30/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: WHATEVER IT IS
10/30/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: and woah it doesn‚Äôt seem like that was like 5 years ago
10/30/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre getting old man
10/30/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah tell me about it
10/30/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Also I KNOOOOOOW
10/30/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: That's some major yoga
10/30/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: You think you could do that?
10/30/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: Also, something I appreciate about you: you're the most fun person I know to go through museums with. It's great to have you get excited about stuff with me, and hear my weird tangents, and learn a bunch. And you also want to spend the same amount of time in museums and have the same goals that I do
10/30/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: No I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs physically possible
10/30/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: The reverse I can
10/30/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: Called candle
10/30/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Oh man sarah doesn‚Äôt like museums
10/30/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs still coming with me to them
10/30/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: But yeah I think you‚Äôre probably the most fun to go to museums with to
10/30/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Admittedly I haven‚Äôt been to many with people besides my parents
10/30/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: My dads a god museum buddy
10/30/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: But he reads EVERYTHINF
10/30/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: which I mostly do
10/30/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: But like we almost left him at the Holocaust museum in dc when he chaperoned in 8th grade
10/30/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Also!  Admissions fellow applications are out!
10/30/19, 2:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm excited to work on that when I get back to Budapest. Would you be willing to read whatever they have me write because I‚Äôm sure they have me write something?
10/30/19, 2:36 PM - Marianna: Okay gotta JET
10/30/19, 2:36 PM - Marianna: bye
10/30/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: Oh and they didn‚Äôt say anything about our bags!
10/30/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: And we have only 2 people in our row!
10/30/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: So the world is taking pity on us
10/30/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: Yeah absolutely!
10/30/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: Have fun! Let me know when you land!

10/30/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: Looks GOOOD
10/30/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: The best part is that it's under an active railway
10/30/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: In the Netherlands!
10/30/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: So there are these really cool glass ceilings and cast iron everything and you can hear the trains
10/30/19, 4:02 PM - Caleb: AND WELCOME
10/30/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

10/30/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Make sure it's from a steet vendor
10/30/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Oh that must be loud?
10/30/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: But like a nice loud?
10/30/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: And yes!
10/30/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Have you ever been here before?
10/30/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: My brain is saying no but I may be misremembering
10/30/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: But I know you went to Belgium and Sweden and it kind of makes sense that this could have been a stop on that trip too
10/30/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Or maybe they were multiple trips
10/30/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just such a travel or!
10/30/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Traveler!
10/30/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Yep! I've been to a couple cities in the Netherlands
10/30/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: My mom's family is super super Dutch
10/30/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: So it's always a joy to go
10/30/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Amsterdam is exciting and fun
10/30/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Rotterdam is cool but toned down
10/30/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: The Hague is really important
10/30/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: (and fun)
10/30/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: And a few other smaller places are very Dutch and quaint
10/30/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: Make sure to go to the pancake house near Anne Frank's museum
10/30/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: And also Anne Frank museum
10/30/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Update we have BOUGHT THE RIGHT TICKET TO GET TO AMSTERDAM
10/30/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: YAY proud of you
10/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: Oh I once was on a ship called the Rotterdam
10/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: Fun memories
10/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: Dutch sounds WHACK
10/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: like whacker than Danish
10/30/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: (No offense)
10/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: And we want to!  We couldn‚Äôt get tickets but we‚Äôre hoping if we wake up early tomorrow, we can get them online for the day because they reserve 20% of day tickets to be sold on the day
10/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: But will keep that in mind
10/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: I promise to go to the pancake house even if we don‚Äôt get tickets to anne frank
10/30/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think it will be too hard to convince Sarah or robin of doing that
10/30/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: That is factually incorrect
10/30/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: What
10/30/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: Okay sounds like it to me
10/30/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: But then again Hungarian sounds normal to me so I might be whack
10/30/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: Maybe it's normalish to me because my grandma speaks Dutch
10/30/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm going to guess that‚Äôs it
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: It's still so sad why it didn't get passed down
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: But oh well
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Hi please enlighten me
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: If my grandma taught me, I'd probably only know how to complain about Democrats in Dutch
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: I know you‚Äôve told me this story
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: And I promise I listen to you
10/30/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just a tad forgetful
10/30/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: AH yeah it's because when my mom and her siblings were growing up, her parents would speak in Dutch when they didn't want the kids to know what they were saying
10/30/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: But THEN they started catching on and actually learning Dutch, my grandparents realized they couldn't get away with it anymore so they stopped
10/30/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: And thus, the Van Regenmorter knowledge of Dutch stopped
10/30/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: I've always wanted to learn though, and I know my mom would be interested
10/30/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: Oh and also now I'm in the Tate
10/30/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: Oh yes
10/30/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: Clever kids
10/30/19, 4:44 PM - Marianna: The bane of all parents existences
10/30/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again
10/30/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Duolingo
10/30/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: And the Tate?
10/30/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Also Sarah saw in the train station there are WAFFLES in the VENDING MACHINE?
10/30/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: Okay how do I say thank you, I‚Äôm sorry, please, yes, no, and hello in dutch
10/30/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt know
10/30/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah sorry I don't remember
10/30/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: And bummer
10/30/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: Well it‚Äôs important you know
10/30/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: So that you can at least maybe pick your roommate
10/30/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Of
10/30/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Or
10/30/19, 4:56 PM - Marianna: And well I know Sarahs not too keen on having two roommates next year because she mentioned it so yeah that‚Äôs a later problem but might be interesting
10/30/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Hear me out
10/30/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: I'll email Mary Anne Shessler and work my way to the top
10/30/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: Jonah said that he had a single
10/30/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: Chris said I would have a single
10/30/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: Maybe Hannah is wrong
10/30/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Who‚Äôs Chris?
10/30/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Could you email him and be like yo double checking?
10/30/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: If he has enough power to go to mary anne about it?
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And update we‚Äôre j chilling in the COLD at Amsterdam central station
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Chris
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Old boss
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah it's frigid up there
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: The last time I was there was in January
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Does he still work there?
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: The sea breeze does unkind things
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah he does
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: He's Belk AC
10/30/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: But it'd be better just to go to Walter or Mary Ann
10/30/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Oh
10/30/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: You could mention
10/30/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Like yo the ra last year did and Chris said I would. Just double checking this is right
10/30/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: But I also don‚Äôt want to put words into your mouth
10/30/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Idk how to email rlo people
10/30/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: You rlo people are SCARY
10/30/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: I have straight up called mary anne though and been like PLEASE HELP ME MY ROOMMATE LEFT DAVIDSON last summer
10/30/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: And she calmed me down and was like ah here are your options
10/30/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Good cookie from what u can tell
10/30/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah she's nice
10/30/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: I'll just ask for clarification, and mention that i was under the impression that I would have a single and I would like to know if there are any alternatives because I've grown quite used to my own space
10/30/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: It'll be fine though
10/30/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Update
10/30/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: I've now gone though the coolest art exhibit I've ever had the pleasure to experience
10/30/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: You say that as if you aren‚Äôt one of the only davidson students currently with a double
10/30/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: OH

10/30/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Good in other words
10/30/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: But I feel like I always say woah those photos are cool!  And I want to sound genuine when I say that because I believe it
10/30/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: And no probably just Maryland at some point
10/30/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: But it was good tonight
10/30/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send photos later
10/30/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: And yeah!  You can either give him my US number but he can other WhatsApp that or give him my snapchat
10/30/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Only** WhatsApp
10/30/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Ok, I sent him your snapchat then
10/30/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Thanks!
10/30/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: But yeah it was absolutely wild
10/30/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: It felt very hallucinogenic, it was odd walking out back into the regular world
10/30/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: One part of the exhibit was just a tunnel of light and fog
10/30/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: And you could only see about 4 feet in front of you, and couldn't see the walls or ceiling
10/30/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: And it was a 120 foot tunnel of light
10/30/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: It was super super cool
10/30/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: How's your night been!
10/30/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Those kind of experiences are always the best
10/30/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Soemtimes I feel that way after yoga
10/30/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Good!
10/30/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: We just had an amazing dinner
10/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: And got 50% off so it brought like a 60 euro bill down to 30 total for some amazing food
10/30/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Doing well so far in Amsterdam
10/30/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: WOAH how did you swing that
10/30/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: That's absolutely awesome
10/30/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you're liking Amsterdam
10/30/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: You see anything fun yet?
10/30/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Or are you sToNeD oUt of YoUr mInD

10/30/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm magic
10/30/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: No it was trip advisor
10/30/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: I did learn it‚Äôs legal (or at least inconsistently enforces and decriminalized) to have sex in a park in Amsterdam after dark
10/30/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs it so far
10/30/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Not seen anything too whacky
10/30/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: Although I must say the hallway reeks of weed outside
10/30/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: But luckily our room doesn‚Äôt smell like that
10/30/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: So no not stoned out fo my mind
10/30/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: But yay!  Let me know how it goes!
10/30/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: Also man you know what I‚Äôm missing this week
10/30/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: Science class doing Halloween demos
10/30/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: Best day of the year
10/30/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: At least up there
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Ah
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Sex in a park
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Interesting
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: I'll leave it at that
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: And WOAH THIS IS INCREDIBLE
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: This show is fantastic
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: And we've got good drank
10/30/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: The night is good
10/30/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: The day was great
10/30/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Hi wish you were here :))

10/30/19, 10:07 PM - Marianna: Did you get wicked themed drinks?
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Some theaters do that
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Hi I wish you were HERE
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: I've got my wicked themed drink
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: And nuh uh
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: AH JEALOUS
10/30/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: we couldn‚Äôt drink when we were seniors watching it
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: London wicked with school sponsored booze > Amsterdam and weed smell
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: This is delicious
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: It's one shot vodka
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: One shot melon liquor
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Lemonade
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: And lime
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Although I think there are some things I wouldn‚Äôt want to drink for
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Watching a show is one of them
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Oh Mar
10/30/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: This is way way better tipsy
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Because I know myself and any alcohol is gonna make me tired or loopy
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: You don't even know
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: No
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: I am not going to agree
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Nuh uh
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: For you it may be
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah you can disagree
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: But your opinion is wrong
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: But I wouldn‚Äôt want to miss a single detail or want to be anywhere else but the theater when watching a show
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Okay
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: The show keeps you enthralled
10/30/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Yes but really I might still fall asleep
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Or just not enjoy it as much
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Noooo way
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Who knows
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Okay
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: We're gonna settle this sometime at Davidson
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: The drink does sound delicious
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: We're gonna pregame a musical
10/30/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: It's a date
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: I just had a glass of Pinot noir
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm gonna show up trashed to an orchestra concert now
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: NOOOOO
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs also for like the same reason I wouldn‚Äôt want to drink at a concert
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: I just want to be THERE not anywhere alcohol would take me
10/30/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: If love to have you there
10/30/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: I hope ya like orch music though
10/30/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: I do
10/30/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Better than vand
10/30/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Band**
10/30/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Band?
10/30/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Mostly because of the strings and I‚Äôm not just saying that
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Hey join orchestra
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: You woodwind capable person
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: My high school had orchestra and band separate
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Like woodwind would be band
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Woodwind has a spot in orchestra
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Only strings basically we‚Äôre orchestra
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOSH
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Maybe clarinet
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember
10/30/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Can we go to the Charlotte symphony sometime
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: And Caleb I am absolutely awful at music especially the flute
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: We can get all dressed up and make a big night out of it
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so finicky
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: NUH UH I need to hear you sometime
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: I wish I played the flute
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Honestly that sounds like a dream
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Man I‚Äôve got it somewhere in Maryland
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: But I actually was terrible
10/30/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Noooo
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I refuse to believe it
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: No no
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs true
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: But
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I want to hear you make music
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: I really can‚Äôt
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Sorry
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: I like singing
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not great singing
10/30/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: But I like to do it so the people in my life have to deal with that soemtimes
10/30/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: I love it when you sing
10/30/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Ok starting again
10/30/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Ttyl
10/30/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Okay go listen to real people sing
10/30/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Also I would like a report on whether you can hear accents when they sing
10/30/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: There is no right answer
10/30/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll probably be asleep when you get out too
10/30/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs me bedtime. Goodnight! I want to hear more about today tomorrow!
10/30/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Yes
10/30/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Yes I can absolutely hear their accents
10/30/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey
10/30/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I hope you had a great night
10/30/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I certainly did
10/30/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Bed is soon though
10/30/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I'll send updates for the morning
10/30/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Back
10/30/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: STREETS
10/30/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: BACK
10/30/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: IN BED üéµüé∂
10/30/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: (to the tune of 'Everybody' -- the Backstreet Boys' first single from their third album 'Backstreet's Back,' released June 1997)
10/30/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Also it was weird, because I'm so used to hearing British accents in any movie which just indicates 'foreign' or space or whatever, and then they closed the show and gave a final word IN BRITISH ACCENTS AND I WAS LIKE WHAT THAT'S RIGHT IT'S REAL
10/30/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Anyway
10/30/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Goodnight
10/30/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you had fun
10/30/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: I have to be up bright and early tomorrow at 6:30, so I need schleep
10/30/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow
10/31/19, 8:29 AM - Marianna: I did get the tune yes
10/31/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: I hope the show was amazing!
10/31/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt see how it couldn‚Äôt be!
10/31/19, 8:31 AM - Marianna: Actors real voices and what they can do in their fake voice always throws me off or at least surprises me
10/31/19, 8:32 AM - Marianna: What are you doing today?
10/31/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: Oh we're visiting this little school called "Cambridge" or something
10/31/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm currently in the online queue to buy tickets for anne Frank and it‚Äôs NERVEWRACKING
10/31/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: HEY if all else fails you'll have quality pancakes
10/31/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: And if that's the backup option, it's not too bad
10/31/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: How long is the line?
10/31/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: OH also for the pancake place, I'd totally recommend the egg nog on the side if you enjoy that sort of thing
10/31/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Well it says there are 127 people in front of me
10/31/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: Hey 127 people for a day is manageable
10/31/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: There's hope
10/31/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: But on the travel forums I frequent it says that is to get ON THE SITE and not necessarily for tickets
10/31/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: So idk
10/31/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs apparently an odd server set up
10/31/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: Huuuuh?
10/31/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: And oh I think I‚Äôve heard about this school!
10/31/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs in Pennsylvania right?
10/31/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: Kidding
10/31/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: And idk
10/31/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: Ah well right now it feels about that far
10/31/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: We've got a long bus ride to it
10/31/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: So I'm probably gonna conk out soon
10/31/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: Bus nap
10/31/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: Anyway, any other plans today?
10/31/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: OH OH OH YOU AND SARAH SHOULD DO A CANAL DINNER
10/31/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: THEY'RE SO FUN
10/31/19, 8:40 AM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôm 46
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Marianna: So I might have overshot the timing
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Marianna: Because I need to be on the site at 9
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to screw this up!
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: You get on a boat, they serve you dinner, and eat while you sail around the canals and talk about the city
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Marianna: Ooooh
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Marianna: Sounds expensive but we can look into it
10/31/19, 8:41 AM - Marianna: And robins here too now!
10/31/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: And yeah, we‚Äôre also going to do the resistance museum
10/31/19, 8:42 AM - Caleb: Oh yay, that's fun!
10/31/19, 8:42 AM - Caleb: I'm looking forward to all the pictures eventually
10/31/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: And yes I want eggnog
10/31/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: That sounds lovely
10/31/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: Do you know the name of the place?
10/31/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: So now I‚Äôm on the site but it‚Äôs the calendar page but no tickets have showed up but idk if that means I can stay here until 9
10/31/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see
10/31/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: I think it might have been "The Pancake Bakery"
10/31/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: I have a Keychain from it, but it's at home
10/31/19, 8:47 AM - Caleb: I could ask my parents to send a picture of it though
10/31/19, 8:48 AM - Caleb: Any plans to see the red light district? It's a super uncomfortable experience but I think it's still a really powerful and important one to have
10/31/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: AH NOW IT PUT ME BACK IN THE QUEUE AND IM 589
10/31/19, 8:51 AM - Marianna: Nooooo
10/31/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: I did the thing I just got on too early
10/31/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: Ah
10/31/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: So frustrating
10/31/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: And I really have no interest in going there
10/31/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: Kind of like christiania
10/31/19, 8:52 AM - Marianna: A little different
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs all legal and admittedly having it legal is probably keeping them safer but I also just don‚Äôt like the premise and don‚Äôt really want to be around it
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: Yeah, that's totally fair
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: Idk
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Now there at 641?
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: How?
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been here?
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Ugh
10/31/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre not gonna get tickets!
10/31/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: I think that in order to truly know what you believe, you need to stare the issue in the face
10/31/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: And uhhh what
10/31/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: Idk idk what happened
10/31/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: Mar I'm gonna be honest this isn't a queue it's a stack
10/31/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: Maybe it got lost in translation
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: The instructions?
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: Idk, maybe
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: Still not gonna get tickets though
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: Are you guys just in your hostel right now?
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs really what we wanted to do!
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: Yeah
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: Everyone else is still in bed
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: Aw, I'm sorry
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm getting the tickets
10/31/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: At least it's comfy?
10/31/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Yeah
10/31/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a cool hostel
10/31/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Definitely the best one of the 3 we stayed in
10/31/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: Haha I still haven't stayed in a hostel actually
10/31/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: I usually travel in decent groups, so we just get an AirBnB so it's not a linear increase in cost
10/31/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: Down to 504
10/31/19, 8:57 AM - Marianna: I gotta watch this I‚Äôll be back after 9
10/31/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: HEY GOOD LUCK
10/31/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: Ttyl
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Marianna: Update got tickets for 8pm
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Caleb: HEYYYYYYY
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Marianna: But I kind of think robin and Sarah might not be too happy with me
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs Halloween
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Caleb: It's worth it
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Caleb: I promise
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Marianna: Which means we‚Äôll be getting out late
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Marianna: I definitely think so
10/31/19, 9:21 AM - Caleb: Well for you maybe
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: I know you said sarah isn't super into history
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: And I don't know Robin
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Marianna: All the early ones were either already sold out or like I kept clicking and it said overbooked so I just went late because I figured it was less likely that someone had JUST clicked th ose
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Marianna: Yeah
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Marianna: Well
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Marianna: They‚Äôre doing it
10/31/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: I think they'll like it

10/31/19, 9:30 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so excited
10/31/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: I read the diary for fun in middle school and then the next year we had it in class as assigned reading but the teacher knew I‚Äôd already read it so she gave me and the two other girls a different book to read about the same time period
10/31/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm SOOO pumped for the resistance museum
10/31/19, 9:32 AM - Marianna: And yeah!
10/31/19, 9:32 AM - Marianna: I sent him a long ass paragraph raving about AIT so far üòÇ

10/31/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: And they did not sell coffee caleb
10/31/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: But now I have a lemon meringue cake and a dirty chai from a CAFE because they do sell actual coffee
10/31/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs been an adventure already
10/31/19, 10:37 AM - Marianna: And oooh
10/31/19, 10:38 AM - Marianna: At the Nokia lab, if you break it, do you have to buy it?  Or do they hire you?
10/31/19, 10:38 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah, I probably should have warned you about that
10/31/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Coffee shops are just a _little_ different
10/31/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/31/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Thats how I'm imagining it went down
10/31/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: And haaaaaaaaaa
10/31/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Idk
10/31/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: I'll walk in and try to break everything I see, I'll let you know what happens
10/31/19, 10:43 AM - Marianna: Pretty much
10/31/19, 10:43 AM - Marianna: I went in and was like this place looks weird and it does NOT smell like coffee it smells like...ah right coffee shops I have heard about these
10/31/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Marianna
10/31/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Guess what we're seeing at the Nokia Bell labs

10/31/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: What were some of the exhibits?
10/31/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: Or at least that would be surprising to me that Nokia and dis would allow that
10/31/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: And okay I will answer that question on a bit
10/31/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: My hands are freezing

10/31/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: But alrighty then

10/31/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Was almost a very relevant song
10/31/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Still a good one though
10/31/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: George Ezra is great
10/31/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Budapest is better though
10/31/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/31/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Haven't heard Budapest
10/31/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: NEVERMIND I'VE DEFINITELY HEARD THIS
10/31/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: For a second I thought you were comparing George Ezra and Budapest
10/31/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/31/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: o goodness gracious
10/31/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: WHAT
10/31/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: we listen to that song all the time

10/31/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Pest**
10/31/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Well he's betrayed you
10/31/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/31/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: No
10/31/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: He just didn‚Äôt have ME as his tour guide
10/31/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: He wouldn‚Äôt have been underwhelmed then
10/31/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Ah yeah maybe that biased me a little bit
10/31/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: A L S O
10/31/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Derek didn't know how to shave with a razor, so I showed him
10/31/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: And now I'm clean shaven for the first time in about 8 or 9 months probably
10/31/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: Like truly clean shaven, no stubble
10/31/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: ...how else do you shave?
10/31/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: scissors?
10/31/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: And what I need pictures
10/31/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Or wait I feel like I‚Äôve seen this
10/31/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: I thought you shaved in philly
10/31/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: And oh my goodness
10/31/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: Anne Frank Museum was fantastic. Being there is just surreal and haunting (but not like in a halloween way)
10/31/19, 9:53 PM - Marianna: I loved it
10/31/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Also Amsterdam is all lit up with Christmas lights it‚Äôs so beautiful
10/31/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: But cold
10/31/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Have I mentioned it‚Äôs cold?
10/31/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Also woah did you realize we‚Äôre currently the closest we‚Äôve been geographically since Budapest?
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Ha nope
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: With an actual razor
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: I got one from consierge
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: I felt the same way about the museum
10/31/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: The most powerful thing was seeing the book case
10/31/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: And just having it all get tied together, it's weird seeing it as the threshold of a regular house and life, and going into the attic and everything that entailed
10/31/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Oh and nope, next time you see my face might be Brussels lol
10/31/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: And you know, it really weirds me out to think about how next semester I'm not going to have to wait months or travel hundreds of miles to see you
10/31/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: It's so weird that's such a foreign thought
10/31/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah and it was the ACTUAL bookcase
10/31/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Crazy
10/31/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Seeing the diaries also got me
10/31/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: And hearing Otto Frank talk on the video
10/31/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: And the other helpers
10/31/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Like it is different when they are just characters in a book
10/31/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: But to HEAR them?
10/31/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Wow
10/31/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: And I heard the bells from the church nearby and I REMEMBER reading about anne hearing them
10/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: And no!  I like seeing your face!  I know you hate selfies but no!
10/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: And uh no I thought we had agreed this was going to be an exclusively abroad thing
10/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Or exclusively long distance is I think how we said it
10/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: One of us is gonna have to transfer
10/31/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah sorry I forgot to tell you I dropped out of Davidson
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: And it ain‚Äôt gonna be me
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Oh good
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: That works
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Well more just forgot to pay tuition lmao
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: No no I‚Äôd like you to still be there in January
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Oh
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Whoops
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: I'm going to Harrisburg Area Community College now
10/31/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Good ol' HACC
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Or we could just do long distance from duke to little
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: That works with me
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a whole 3 minutes?
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Duke?
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Caleb: Girl that's in Durham
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: No the other duke
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt it called duke
10/31/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Yes
10/31/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs duke
10/31/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
10/31/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Silly silly
10/31/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: But yeah
10/31/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: I can deal with 3 minutes I guess
10/31/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: I could _probably_ consider traveling that to see you
10/31/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Also hey hey hey
10/31/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Guess what I'm drinking
10/31/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Also also also
10/31/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Fine I'll cave and send you not a picture
10/31/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: But a gif
10/31/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Worth about 5 pictures
10/31/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
10/31/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: (thanks woo)
10/31/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Also I promise I don't send you more messages because I see you opened them and aren't responding
10/31/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: It's totally totally fine
10/31/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: It's just that I always think of thing I want to tell you and don't want to wait
10/31/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: (sorry I'm debatably drunk at the moment)
10/31/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Well maybe at least like once a month?
10/31/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs been a pretty good system so far
10/31/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: I mean
10/31/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Okay what are you drinking?
10/31/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Because it is out of a big

10/31/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: A TEA mug
10/31/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: And yes that is by far one of the best gifs I‚Äôve seen in a while
10/31/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: And I promise I don‚Äôt read you sending more messages as pestering me
10/31/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Okay okay

11/1/19, 10:53 AM - Caleb: Then realized I had 5 minutes to pack
11/1/19, 10:54 AM - Caleb: Also Derek had been violently throwing up since 6:30
11/1/19, 10:55 AM - Caleb: But we packed, my zipper ripped on my bag, so I wrapped the whole thing in packing tape
11/1/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: And then we're having a debrief for the trip
11/1/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Oh no
11/1/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: To the Derek and the bag thing
11/1/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs having a rough week
11/1/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: What did you guys end up doing last night?
11/1/19, 11:22 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: The first five minutes was Ulf telling us about all the awesome last minute ideas for the meeting, none of which he could do
11/1/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: And okay so last night we just went from club to club
11/1/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Made lots of friends
11/1/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Many very interesting people
11/1/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: And got generally very drunk
11/1/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: We wound up like an hour away from our hotel, so it was an adventure getting back
11/1/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: And no, I don't think those are Bleeding hearts
11/1/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Bleeding hearts are a heart shape at the top with a drop coming through the apex
11/1/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 11:46 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 11:46 AM - Caleb: Also looking through my camera roll and found this
11/1/19, 11:46 AM - Caleb: No idea who the back people were
11/1/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: The meeting?
11/1/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: And oof sounds like an adventure
11/1/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: We ended up uber ing back because we were also far away from our hostel
11/1/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: And oh bummer but they‚Äôre still pretty
11/1/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: And NO you did not just draw whiskers
11/1/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: Where‚Äôs your Halloween spirit
11/1/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: And what is that?
11/1/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: Also!  On the way to airport
11/1/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: I like amsterdam but my fingers do not
11/1/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs too cold for them
11/1/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Well
11/1/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: My Halloween spirit couldn't fit into my luggage
11/1/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Sorry about that
11/1/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: And we shopped around but couldn't find anything
11/1/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: So we decided to go as a herd of low effort cat costumes
11/1/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: And it's a UC Berkeley engineering student card
11/1/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I think
11/1/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I don't know anyone that goes there
11/1/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: True
11/1/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs why you have to go with tutus
11/1/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: They squish pretty well
11/1/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: And wow
11/1/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a fun thing to wake up with
11/1/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: Any ideas how you got it?
11/1/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Also in airport!
11/1/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: I really don‚Äôt want to leave
11/1/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm excited for some relaxing days in luzern
11/1/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: What do you all do today?
11/1/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Also the audio is gold
11/1/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: And don‚Äôt worry half of it is just silence on your end
11/1/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: I'll keep the tutu thing in mind for next year
11/1/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Thenk ya
11/1/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: And I gave you a recap of most the day already
11/1/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: But now we're just shopping
11/1/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Have you ever been in a Muji?
11/1/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: You'd absolutely love it
11/1/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: It's like if Wes Anderson owned a strictly earth toned Ikea
11/1/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: It's like the physical manifestation of a sepia Pintrest
11/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like earth tones
11/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Like don‚Äôt hate them
11/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm a more bold color gal
11/1/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Also
11/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: You want to be proud of your girlfriend?
11/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: You know how she likes challenges?
11/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: The lady at the gate told me I‚Äôd have to prove to her that my bag fits the dimensions
11/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Which meant shoving my bag into the tiny bin
11/1/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: And she did it at first and was like yeah no the wheels don‚Äôt fit. That means you have to pay 60‚Ç¨ to check in
11/1/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: So of course I say Sarah hold my camera
11/1/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: And SHOVE the bag in
11/1/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: And of course it fits
11/1/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôve just been on an easyjet flight and I know it goes in the overhead bin
11/1/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: So after I get it in, I spin around and smile snuggly at the lady and she goes okay then you can go to the left
11/1/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: But man I wish someone had gotten a picture of it
11/1/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: Triumphant marianna
11/1/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the marianna right now
11/1/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: YAY good job triumphant marianna
11/1/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: Sounds like quite the sight
11/1/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Update day has gotten a lot more fun
11/1/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: London Christmas markets, macrons, and chocolate
11/1/19, 3:11 PM - Marianna: Oh soooooo pretty
11/1/19, 3:11 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre hoping Budapest Christmas markets are open when we get back
11/1/19, 3:12 PM - Marianna: Because Europe doesn‚Äôt have thanksgiving so the next thing is Christmas so they get to start at the end of October apparently!
11/1/19, 3:12 PM - Marianna: And hello from Switzerland!
11/1/19, 3:12 PM - Marianna: Every other time I‚Äôve been at this airport, I‚Äôve been jet lagged from the flight from the us
11/1/19, 3:12 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a little weird to be here not on us time honestly
11/1/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: Haha I felt the same way about flying through Cope
11/1/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: Also hello!
11/1/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: Please send some pictures
11/1/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Wait when did you fly through cope?
11/1/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: ... Thats a lot less of an exciting picture than I thought
11/1/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: And it was last time on my way to G√∂teborg
11/1/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: But also I'd probably feel the same way if I flew through Amsterdam
11/1/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: I have so many good memories of Schiphol
11/1/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/1/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre waiting for BETSY!
11/1/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah Schiphol was nice
11/1/19, 3:37 PM - Marianna: Except the mean gate lady
11/1/19, 3:38 PM - Marianna: She also though wanted us to shove Sarahs bag in there and we kind of tried while she was
11/1/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Sorry didn‚Äôt finish
11/1/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: While the lady was working we tried but never actually got it in the box but of course it fits so we kind of just took it out and acted like it had worked and then went on our merry ways
11/1/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: So proud
11/1/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: You're a bold one Ghirardelli
11/1/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: Also look what we're eating
11/1/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: So English
11/1/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: So quaint
11/1/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: I know that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard
11/1/19, 3:46 PM - Marianna: And while that looks good English food just does not inspire me like other food does
11/1/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Does other food just mean Italian food
11/1/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: And some Hungarian food
11/1/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: No
11/1/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: Like literally any other food
11/1/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Sushi
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt love Thai food
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Or sushi
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: But sushi is at least pretty
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: Indian food
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Like I appreciate the art of it
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Indian food I like a little
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt love
11/1/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: But I like sometimes
11/1/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Hmmm
11/1/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Fair
11/1/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Wait did I ever tell you how I used to make sushi with my mom
11/1/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: We had the bamboo mats and everything
11/1/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: Oh also: another thing I absolutely love
11/1/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: Bread pudding
11/1/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: We always used to make it around Christmas
11/1/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: You have mentioned this I think
11/1/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Because she used to live in Japan right?
11/1/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Oh I love bread pudding too
11/1/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Nonna makes a lot of it
11/1/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Warmed up with milk or cream is the best
11/1/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: Have I told you about stratta around Christmas!
11/1/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: Oh my GOODNESS
11/1/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: Warm bread pudding with maple syrup is so so good
11/1/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: And no! You haven't! What's the story?
11/1/19, 6:40 PM - Marianna: Oh maple syrup
11/1/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Have not tried that
11/1/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Caleb there is a brothel in this Airbnb building
11/1/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm only a little not okay with it
11/1/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs such a nice Airbnb other than that
11/1/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: And we always make stratta for Christmas morning
11/1/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: We (mostly my dad) prepare it the night/day before and then he wakes up early and pops it in the oven in the morning so by the time the rest of us wake up and get ready for the day, it‚Äôs cooked and still warm
11/1/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: Uh
11/1/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: How linked is it
11/1/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: And how loud is it
11/1/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Also OH goodness that sounds so so good, I love Christmas traditions
11/1/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Okay taking off I'll talk to you later!
11/1/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Not loud that we can tell
11/1/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Just in the same building

11/2/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: A long time ago, there was a Copenhagen beer company that released a special Christmas beer
11/2/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: It's strong, sweet, and comes in a blue bottle
11/2/19, 9:14 AM - Caleb: And it's called Yulebryg
11/2/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: Which means Christmas something, yule = Christmas
11/2/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: So anyway
11/2/19, 9:15 AM - Caleb: As a marketing campaign for the beer, they made a big party out of it
11/2/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: The party marks the first day of the Christmas season, it's sort of a kickoff for Christmas hype
11/2/19, 9:16 AM - Caleb: And it got so popular that now its basically a huge  Danish holiday
11/2/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: People give out free beer, blue Santa hats, robes, stuff like that
11/2/19, 9:17 AM - Caleb: The streets are absolutely packed with celebration
11/2/19, 9:45 AM - Marianna: Wow

11/2/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: And did you get any pictures from last night?
11/2/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: No pictures, I did send a lot of snapchats though
11/2/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: And I actually like it! Apparently no one actually likes the beer, so every time I got asked how it was, I surprised people
11/2/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: Its got a darker, bolder flavor which I like
11/2/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: It's way better then the regular lagers
11/2/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: It actually tastes like something other than gross water
11/2/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: What a shocker
11/2/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: And also they're delivered by horse drawn carriages which is fun
11/2/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: Gotta say, I'm tapping out though
11/2/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: No pun intended
11/2/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: It's basically been a week of pub drinking for me, I feel gross and just want good sleep
11/2/19, 10:09 AM - Marianna: Yes I did see all the snapchats
11/2/19, 10:11 AM - Marianna: I appreciated the Santa hat mirror selfie
11/2/19, 10:12 AM - Marianna: And hey anything better than bad tasting water is good with me
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: I think you did say you were tapping out like a week ago
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: But hey
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Whatever you want to do
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: I mean
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt plan on it
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: I usually do for a couple days
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: We have decided that Budapest is the best going out we‚Äôve seen so we‚Äôre gonna appreciate it while we can
11/2/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: It's more of an "I need a break"
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah no same
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: Just Halloween in London and J-dag in Copenhagen were a lot back to back
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: And also I think I'm getting sick
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: Yeah that makes sense
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: No!!
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: Bad!!
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: No sick!!
11/2/19, 10:14 AM - Marianna: I have soup recipes if you want to make soup
11/2/19, 10:16 AM - Caleb: I'll be honest I'd love that
11/2/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: I need to go to the grocery store today anyway
11/2/19, 11:25 AM - Marianna: Okay I am pretty sure there‚Äôs a chicken soup recipe and maybe a few more on the recipe doc
11/2/19, 11:26 AM - Marianna: I am pretty sure my mom has a easy chicken one though but I can ask her for that
11/2/19, 11:26 AM - Marianna: But I may not be able to do that today
11/2/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: I'm sure the one on the doc will be fine, thanks
11/2/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: So! What are you guys doing today?
11/2/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Just wandering Lucerne
11/2/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Or luzern
11/2/19, 11:44 AM - Marianna: Whichever spelling you‚Äôd like
11/2/19, 11:45 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre up by the town wall rn
11/2/19, 11:45 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs sooooo pretty here
11/2/19, 11:45 AM - Marianna: And they‚Äôre all ready for christmas
11/2/19, 11:45 AM - Marianna: Although the weathers nice enough we‚Äôre not wearing jackets
11/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: well
11/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: I winged a dish tonight
11/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: And my goodness
11/2/19, 3:42 PM - Caleb: It warms my belly and my soul
11/2/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: How's your day been?
11/2/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: You had dinner at 4pm?
11/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: And good!
11/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: We just got back to the Airbnb
11/2/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so expensive here so we decided we‚Äôd eat in tonight so I‚Äôm cooking chicken and we bought a fondue kit to make it here
11/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: I mean
11/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Late lunch/early dinner
11/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: OOOOO
11/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: That sounds deliciou
11/2/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Delicious*
11/2/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: It's been a while since the last episode of Cooking with Marianna, hasn't it?
11/2/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  I haven‚Äôt cooked for 2 weeks about.
11/2/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Because last week was midterms so we ate out or had leftovers from the weekend
11/2/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah, school tends to absolutely decimate my schedule with things like that
11/2/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Hey I'm looking forward to the next episode though! Probably sometime next week I'm guessing?
11/2/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Also thanks, these next two weeks are going to be rough so I'm gonna need all the soul food I can get
11/2/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Oh man I missed betsy so much
11/2/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so good to catch up with here
11/2/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Her**
11/2/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And okay
11/2/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll see if I can scrounge up anything else
11/2/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey hey
11/2/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/2/19, 5:11 PM - Caleb: Guess what I'm signing up for next semester
11/2/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Discrete?
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: And love him
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Yup
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Idk man, heard mixed reviews
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: But his discrete was a little different than mine
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: You and Sarah seem kinda on the fence
11/2/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Like people said his was quite hard
11/2/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: We like him as a math prof better
11/2/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Also I think Joey is taking that class too...
11/2/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Well
11/2/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Looks like I have to drop out
11/2/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: No I think it‚Äôll be great
11/2/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember what he‚Äôs doing yet
11/2/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your night been!
11/2/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Well
11/2/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: I did laundry which was nice
11/2/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: And now I'm scheduling classes and am actually absolutely terrified
11/2/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: There's only one section of two classes I need being offered, and they're at the same time
11/2/19, 6:00 PM - Caleb: Like haha whoops guess I can't graduate how silly
11/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Oh no
11/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Can you take one another semester?
11/2/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what I was really worried about if I hadn‚Äôt been able to get credit this semester
11/2/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Well
11/2/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: The two main conflicts are Physics and Genomics
11/2/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Dr. T-S is pregnant so she can't teach genomics, after next semester
11/2/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: But there might be a sub
11/2/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: Like Heyer or something
11/2/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: And physics is always up in the air, and the mcat is coming up
11/2/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: So I'm thinking I need to prioritize math and premed, then deal with the Dr. TS issues later
11/2/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: Because genomics I can have some wiggle room with
11/2/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: The AAMC I can't
11/2/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: AHHH it's just stressful I hate this
11/2/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: Not my ideal Saturday night
11/2/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/2/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: AAMC?
11/2/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: And do you need physics for the MCAT?  Also they do offer physics literally every semester
11/2/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Also I thought there was usually more than 1 physics section?  Or maybe not
11/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: The people who administer the MCAT
11/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: And yep
11/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Two semesters of physics needed for med schools
11/2/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Why? No idea
11/2/19, 7:27 PM - Caleb: And yeah, but since I need two semesters of physics, I gotta get started on them if I want to take the mcat senior spring
11/2/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Ohhhhh
11/2/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: I thought you were planning on doing med school after a year?  Do you still need to do mcat senior year then?
11/2/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: But yeah sounds genomics is more important
11/2/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/2/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Taking the gap year would mean I take the mcat at the end of senior year
11/2/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Oh so are you not planning on doing that?  Or just want to have the option?
11/2/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: It's more of necessity
11/2/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: I'm debating taking it over the summer though
11/2/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: So junior summer Physics I, and then the next semester Physics II
11/2/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/5DJpci59ruBqsHLKYerhoN?si=dOJB86_RRJy-fkTe27Wdrg
11/2/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/2HfLr7a8vidVZDiwF8Ouvy?si=IB7fH7EJRO6xOlB9tUw27g
11/2/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: Also listen to those when you get a chance
11/2/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: Oof that sounds like no fun
11/2/19, 8:10 PM - Marianna: But you gotta do what you gotta do
11/2/19, 8:10 PM - Caleb: Yep
11/2/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: Right now it's looking like I'll double lab Orgo II and Biochem
11/2/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs not too bad
11/2/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: I say having taken only 1 lab ever
11/2/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Eh I've done it before
11/2/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: People complain too much
11/2/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: I didn't have a whole lot of free time last semester, but honestly I could do it again if I needed to
11/2/19, 8:14 PM - Caleb: It would actually be easier than what I have, I could probably lump a 5th class on
11/2/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Why would you even do that to yourself
11/2/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Well idk you‚Äôre smart you could probably do that
11/2/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: I could not
11/2/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: I like sleep too much
11/2/19, 8:52 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the rest of the schedule looking?
11/2/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: So pretty
11/2/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: So fun
11/2/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: For some reason it's kinda cathartic to make organized spreadsheets
11/2/19, 9:26 PM - Caleb: Maybe accounting is my true calling
11/2/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: I think this semester is going to be leaning heavily into Chem and math
11/2/19, 9:28 PM - Caleb: And I'll deal with physics in the summer
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: ...does that say anal chem
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: ...
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Not anymore
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Good
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Oh
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: That class does NOT sound fun
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Oh god wait
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: I sent that to Dr. T-S
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Doesn‚Äôt look like an awful schedule though
11/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: No
11/2/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: Yee
11/2/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: Well yeah I should actually drop out now
11/2/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: Not too late
11/2/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm gonna do math modeling next semester
11/2/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: Not that I think it would be good to be in the same class
11/2/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: But it looks like a fun class
11/2/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: Ah yeah, I mean we both know I'd be super competitive anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/2/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: But joking aside that would probably be fun, let me know if you follow through on that
11/2/19, 9:32 PM - Caleb: I've realized that I'm up to the mercy of webtree though
11/2/19, 9:33 PM - Marianna: I need to take it next semester
11/2/19, 9:35 PM - Caleb: Why next semester?
11/2/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: If webtree doesn‚Äôt give it to me im gonna ask chartier who‚Äôs the prof and my advisor to get a ceiling extension
11/2/19, 9:37 PM - Caleb: Is it not offered next semester?
11/2/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: And just because I already have 3 or 4 classes I have to take next fall so I couldn‚Äôt do it then and I want to have an easy senior spring in case I do a thesis
11/2/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: It may be only a spring thing too
11/2/19, 9:38 PM - Marianna: A lot of math classes are only either spring or fall
11/2/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Oh lord well that makes my life unfortunate
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Some are odd or even years
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Well a lot of people
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: But including me at the moment
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not consistent
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: What do you mean?
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: Just webtree in general
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Marianna: ?
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: GAHHHHHH why can't we just get the classes we spend so much money for
11/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Well I've got 3 math classes for my major
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Marianna: Which ones are they?
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: 3 left*
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Marianna: I can probably tell you their patterns
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: 3 credits in:
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: Math 140
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: Math 210
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: Math 220 / CSC 220
11/2/19, 9:40 PM - Marianna: But the cs department is stealing math profs because cs profs are all on sabbatical so it‚Äôs not always consistent
11/2/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: Oh you have to do math modeling?
11/2/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: Hang on I'll just show you
11/2/19, 9:41 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: 140 will be offered every semester because it‚Äôs a common distribution req thing
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: What's your take on that
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: On what
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: The '3 credit' thing
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs only 3 credits in 3 classes why is it worded like that
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: No idea
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: That's why it confused me
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: Like, tell me that I need to take these classes
11/2/19, 9:42 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Not that I have an option between 3 classes as long as I pick all 3
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: But yeah, I need modeling
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Well I guess it‚Äôs the math 220 or csc 220 means 2 classes even though they‚Äôre the same
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: I
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Hate
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Crosslisting
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: But depending if they‚Äôre taught with the math or cs profs it can be a little different
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: That and dual listing labs
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Dual listing labs?
11/2/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Okay
11/2/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Remember how you complained that CS/math majors have like 0 class options, and Bio or other stem kids have a ton
11/2/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Basically, what they do is have one class, and that class has two lab sections
11/2/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Yes...
11/2/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: But instead of listing like this:
11/2/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: "CHE 350, MWF 1:30-2:20. Lab: T 1:40-4:20 or M 1:30-4:20"
11/2/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: It lists is like this
11/2/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: All of the "intro to organic chemistry" classes are literally one class, just with different lab sections
11/2/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: So instead of having them as a note under one class, it's listed 6 seperage times
11/2/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: And that happens with nearly ever lab class
11/2/19, 9:48 PM - Caleb: So the listings are super inflated
11/2/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I‚Äôve noticed that
11/2/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs dumb
11/2/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Hard to look at to plan too
11/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: Tell me about it
11/2/19, 9:49 PM - Caleb: It's so easy to mix up the numbers
11/2/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/2/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: I have a word doc of it
11/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: I'm more of a Libre Office fella
11/2/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/2/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/2/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: This isn‚Äôt gonna work actually
11/2/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/2/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Libre office is a dealbreaker
11/2/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: _hi if you receive the following message, it means..._
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: NO
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: please no
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Mr WhatsApp I like talking to caleb
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs a good one
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Please
11/2/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: _hmmmm whatittoya_
11/2/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: _sounds like he stands pretty hard with FOSS, you sure this will work out?_
11/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a lot to me
11/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: :)
11/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Please tell him
11/2/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: I like him
11/2/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Ah yes hello
11/2/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: How's it going
11/2/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: How's your night
11/2/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Still got all your fingers after opening that wine bottle?
11/2/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs going well
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: We make fondue!
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: OoOooOooo
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: That sounds good
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: I don't think I've ever had fondue though
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Because we could have gone out to eat and gotten fondue for 30$ each
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: But instead we made it
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Because aldi has fondue Kira
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Oh really?
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/2/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: It's the chocolate stuff right?

11/2/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: I bought a box of assorted chocolates in Bruges, and figured I could snack on them on the way back
11/2/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: Now on the way back, I'm sitting next to Mr. Miller, our teacher
11/2/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: And I snag a chocolate, and it was a tasty truffle
11/2/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: And then being the generous soul I am, I offer one to my teacher
11/2/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: He thanks me, takes it, plops it in his mouth, and gives me the most stern look I'd gotten in a long time
11/2/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: He didn't say anything, but I took another one and found out that some were, in fact, alcoholic
11/2/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôm over 18
11/2/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: And in Switzerland

11/2/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: And not have to listen to the same music in two different rooms
11/2/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm putting this album on how and probably heading to sleep soon

11/2/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
11/2/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I just realized, since I follow you on spotify, I can just click on your name and it goes straight to the song

11/2/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Living in the future

11/2/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: I think the song I‚Äôm currently on is my favorite
11/2/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Busy and important
11/2/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Like his voice is deeper and the tune of it is nicer I think
11/2/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: Honestly
11/2/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: I keep going back to the Joy Williams album sometimes
11/2/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: That might be my favorite from this all'
11/2/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Hey we‚Äôre not done exploring albums to go to sleep to
11/2/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: But yeah it‚Äôs a good one
11/2/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: I listened to that as I napped
11/2/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: I also am making a playlist of all of these albums so if o needed to I can just shuffle and get some good ones
11/2/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Oo

11/3/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: But GOOD MORNING
11/3/19, 10:11 AM - Caleb: Good morning!
11/3/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: Does he like the watermelon or not
11/3/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: And you know what I‚Äôm super pumped for
11/3/19, 10:33 AM - Caleb: Uh
11/3/19, 10:34 AM - Caleb: I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say petting all the dogs on Davidson's campus
11/3/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: Well yes but not what I was thinking of
11/3/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: Piglet!
11/3/19, 10:35 AM - Marianna: He stayed in Budapest
11/3/19, 10:36 AM - Caleb: PIGLET!

11/3/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Well
11/3/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: Caleb
11/3/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs a stuffed animal
11/3/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: But I will at least pretend he‚Äôs excited to see me
11/3/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Ah gosh darn it
11/3/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: How could I forget
11/3/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: When are you heading back?

11/3/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: I've gotten like 0 photos from this trip
11/3/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: Although idk if I‚Äôll get to do it today
11/3/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: I'm excited to see some of them too!
11/3/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: And we‚Äôre getting brunch now and then we ride in a train to the airport
11/3/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: I may just write an email to my family and also send it to you with a lot of the stories and things
11/3/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt have to read it
11/3/19, 11:08 AM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs probably how you‚Äôll at least see the photos
11/3/19, 11:17 AM - Caleb: Yeah that's fair
11/3/19, 11:17 AM - Caleb: It's a lot of effort to retell different people the same thing
11/3/19, 11:18 AM - Marianna: Update I have hot chocolate
11/3/19, 11:18 AM - Marianna: I miss swiss miss man
11/3/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: Also I've realized something about DIS that I really liked
11/3/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: On travel weeks, they pay for almost everything
11/3/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Like, we were eating out at REALLY nice restaurants, getting wine, going to pubs, getting breakfast at fun places
11/3/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: And it was all on DIS's fine
11/3/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: Dime*
11/3/19, 11:19 AM - Caleb: It's like travel with 0 of the spending guilt
11/3/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah that is really nice
11/3/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Oh my gosh wait a second
11/3/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Did you have hot chocolate in Amsterdam
11/3/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: Well I mean I bet it‚Äôs in tuition but no spending guilt
11/3/19, 11:21 AM - Caleb: Please tell me you did
11/3/19, 11:21 AM - Marianna: No...
11/3/19, 11:22 AM - Marianna: Sarah did
11/3/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: Ah darn it
11/3/19, 11:22 AM - Caleb: It's some of the best hot chocolate I've ever had
11/3/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: It's okay though
11/3/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: Belgium is famous for its hot chocolate
11/3/19, 11:23 AM - Caleb: We'll have plenty
11/3/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: Chocomel
11/3/19, 11:24 AM - Caleb: That's what it's called
11/3/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: Hey guess what Hanne just told me
11/3/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: You're not gonna believe it
11/3/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: Oh no
11/3/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: Well I am not too particular about my hot chocolate
11/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Swiss miss with marshmallows is my go to but apparently it‚Äôs not that great in the public eye
11/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: But yes I‚Äôm excited for Belgium
11/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm actually going today!
11/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: We have our layover in brussels
11/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: And what did hanne tell you?
11/3/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Also did you ever bring up the shower thing?
11/3/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: No way! That's awesome
11/3/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: And it's okay, all hot chocolate is good, but great hot chocolate incredible
11/3/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: We were talking about sewing, and she was like "aha I'm so clumsy," and I was like "yeah me too hahaha"
11/3/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: To which she replies, "really? I don't think I've ever seen you do something clumsy. Maybe you just hide it well"
11/3/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: So there ya have it
11/3/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: And no, I ended up not bringing it up
11/3/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Honestly it's not that they were showering together that made me uncomfy, it was more that it feels like there's a clear division in the privlages of people who live here
11/3/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: It feels a little unequal to me
11/3/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: But that's not worth getting in to, especially not when I'm here for only one more month and won't be having anyone over
11/3/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: She obviously hasn‚Äôt seen you enough
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Everyone who knows caleb Grenko knows caleb Grenko is Clumsy
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Yeah that makes sense
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: I'm confused
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: Why is my first name lower case
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: I can see how that‚Äôs annoying but they do have special privileges even if it‚Äôs dumb that they do
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know
11/3/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: My phone likes to capitalize or all caps random things
11/3/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: Like davidson and BETSY
11/3/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a random number generator which is capitalized
11/3/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: Or maybe your phone just knows how much you love BETSY
11/3/19, 12:27 PM - Caleb: But yeah
11/3/19, 12:28 PM - Caleb: It's unequal, but not worth correcting for me tbh
11/3/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Yeah I guess I‚Äôm just enthusiastic about BETSY
11/3/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôm just not enthusiastic enough about Caleb
11/3/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Oh it capitalized there
11/3/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: What the heck phone
11/3/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: Also I've barely left bed today
11/3/19, 12:31 PM - Caleb: I should go to the library and work shouldn't I
11/3/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: OH YEAH did I tell you that I figured out what my final project for Neural Nets is gonna be
11/3/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Also Reid just came back, he did the walk of shame in a pirate costume
11/3/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Oh what‚Äôs the final project
11/3/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: And go Reid!!!
11/3/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs always the best to spot a walk of shame and have whatever the persons wearing being OBVIOUSLY from the night before
11/3/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Like after semis on campu
11/3/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Campus
11/3/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre like wow all these people are awfully dressed up
11/3/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: I suppose for Halloween too
11/3/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Ah I miss davidson in the mornings
11/3/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Haha he only had to walk down some stairs, not across all of Copenhagen
11/3/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Also I never got why it was called the walk of shame
11/3/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Should be called the walk of pride imo
11/3/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Halloween is the best though, you get to see people on a whole 'nother level of disheveled
11/3/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve heard It called the stride of pride before
11/3/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: Betsy calls it that
11/3/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: And ooooooooh he‚Äôs a spoiled pup
11/3/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre currently going back to Zurich in the train!
11/3/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: Paint him like one of your French dogs
11/3/19, 2:24 PM - Caleb: You feel like you had a good trip?
11/3/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: Where are cavaliers from?
11/3/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: And yes!
11/3/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: Amsterdam was my favorite
11/3/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: I could definitely go to another city rn but it‚Äôs kind of nice to know I‚Äôm going home
11/3/19, 2:47 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt want to go to classes tomorrow though
11/3/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: They're English bird dogs that got bred to be highly efficient cuddling and lap machines
11/3/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: And oof same here

11/3/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: Well that's what tonight is to decide, the topic of the paper
11/3/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: It's for my Nordic mythology class
11/3/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: Right now I'm thinking about this: the literary use of death in the Icelandic sagas
11/3/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: I've even got a pithy main title, "The Pen is More Effective than the Sword"
11/3/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: Hmmm that sounds really cool
11/3/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know anything about it so idk if you can write a paper about it but hey I believe you can do it!

11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Although my moms dog was named lassie
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: AH of course you haven't
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: It never tastes good
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: You know what it is though right
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: Lassie, not iced coffee
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Although I can do pretty well with the cold brew and creamer in commons
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/3/19, 4:57 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a movie about a dog
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: And look!
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: Show about a good dog*
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: When I was little I used to watch Lassie with my grandma
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: We'd sit around her super old TV and she had all the VHS tapes
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Switzerland is a magical place
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: Also I should make you iced coffee sometime then
11/3/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: I just need a milk frother
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Who our age has a milk frothed
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Oh man now I really want to go to Switzerland
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: What is a milk frother
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Zelli does!
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: I will warn you it‚Äôs more expensive than Copenhagen
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: And I've actually wanted to go to Switzerland for a long time, I guess I
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: I
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: It kind of sucks
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: I've never gotten the chance really
11/3/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Man texting with a laptop is hard when you compulsively hit enter
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Eh, thats fine
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: I'm not trying to live in switzerland, and a weekend wouldn't kill me
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: probably
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: I definitely want to come back when I‚Äôm established with like a job and don‚Äôt need to worry about how this is soooooo expensive heresy
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Here**
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: I had a resident from Switzerland actually
11/3/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Zach Villamin!
11/3/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: He was definitely one of my favorites
11/3/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Probably my favorite actually, just keep that hush hush
11/3/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: He's one of the people I'm really looking forward to hanging out with when I get back to Davidson
11/3/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Especially now that I'm not his Hall Counselor
11/3/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I know him
11/3/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be sure to tell all of your residents that I do know
11/3/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Kidding!
11/3/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so weird to hear that hall counselors do have favorites
11/3/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like ahah so it is true!  Just like how parents have favorites!
11/3/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Oh its absolutely true
11/3/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: I liked them all
11/3/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: Okay I liked a lot of them
11/3/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Okay I liked more than I didn't
11/3/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: But there were like 4-5 that I could see myself becoming real friends with and hanging out after I wasn't their authority figure
11/3/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: For the record: even if I didn't like residents, they were still part of first belk and I was in their corner no matter what
11/3/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: Like when Joseph peed in my room, I talked with Chris to see if I could let him off with a lesson instead of throwing the book at him
11/3/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I believe that
11/3/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt see many hall counselors as being bad people and not willing to help anyone
11/3/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Are you excited to be an ra next semester?
11/3/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Like are you happy that it will be less responsibility and almost involvement than a hall counselor?
11/3/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Considering its less responsibility, less work, and more pay
11/3/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/3/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: It'll be nice
11/3/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: There are definitely parts I'll miss though
11/3/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: I really liked being needed if that makes sense
11/3/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: I guess I liked being needed, but didn't like what it entailed at some points
11/3/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: 3 am lockouts aren't fun, ever
11/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Oh you get paid more?
11/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs nice
11/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Does this mean if I‚Äôm sleeping over I‚Äôll also get woken up for 3am lockouts?
11/3/19, 5:40 PM - Marianna: Because hmm
11/3/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: On plane!
11/3/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre in the last row
11/3/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Which means this is my view!
11/3/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Well, unfortunately, yeah
11/3/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: If its past 2 on weekends, I get to tell them to call CamPo
11/3/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: And that's 12 for weeknights
11/3/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/3/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Not too bad
11/3/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: So at least I dont need to get up, get dressed, and let them in ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
11/3/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: I feel like in those moments I‚Äôd be an awful ra because I‚Äôd be so grumpy
11/3/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: It wouldn‚Äôt be pleasant for anyone
11/3/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Nah, at 3am on the phone you don't need to be pleasant
11/3/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Usually I have a mini lecture for them on the phone
11/3/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: "Look, if you're intelligent enough to read this number outside a doorway, you can also read that it says "DO NOT CALL AFTER 2. I'm a person. I need to sleep too. Call campus police, like it says."
11/3/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: And after that I usually get an apology and they hang up
11/3/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Oh I think I‚Äôd feel so shamed if I got that over the phone
11/3/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Poor kids just don‚Äôt want campo to know they‚Äôre drunk
11/3/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Actually I‚Äôve been woken up at 5am to call campo because someone was locked in a lounge and I was the only sober person they knew
11/3/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Like of our friends they knew I hadn‚Äôt been drinking
11/3/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Okay
11/3/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Im going to let you in on a secret
11/3/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: If you're not about to die, campus police DOES NOT care if you're drunk
11/3/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: As long as you're trying to get into your own room and can speak reasonably intelligibly, they just want you to go to bed and sleep it off
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Yes I have figured that out by now
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Th is was just EARLY freshmen year
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: If you just keep your head down and don't cause any trouble beyond being drunk, itll all be good
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: So we didn‚Äôt know
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: People get so paranoid around them
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: Ah yeah that makes sense
11/3/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm imagining that conversation wasn't super pleasant either
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: Which one?  With me and the cop or me and the friends?
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I definitely wouldn't be happy
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: With you
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: Waking you up at 5am sounds dangerous
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm Max rollfinke was nice about it though
11/3/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: I was like really you can‚Äôt deal with this
11/3/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: But he was just trying to help harry
11/3/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: And I wanted to help
11/3/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: So how did Harry get locked in a lounge?
11/3/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: So after the original ‚Äúwhy is the door open and someone is talking to me‚Äù I was fine with helping
11/3/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Well
11/3/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Mary Elizabeth and Max has been making out in the lounge and Harry was also there
11/3/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: And they were like nah we‚Äôre not gonna hook up in here with Harry passed out here
11/3/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: So they left
11/3/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: (And went to the rich laundry room)
11/3/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: But closed the door
11/3/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: And the base rich lounge used to be an old room so it has the automatic locking thing
11/3/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: So it automatically locked
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: And when they went back to the lounge, the door was locked and after they knocked Harry wasn‚Äôt responding or waking up and opening it.
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: So he came and got me.
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: OH GOD NO WAIT
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: IT WAS ON THE LAUNDRY TABLE WASNT IT
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: And I rattled the door and made a ton of noise and Harry still didn‚Äôt wake up
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: NONONONONONO
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Which is a little concerning
11/3/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Because he had also done 14 shots before we left for f
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: And I had ALREADY TAKEN HIM TO BED AROUND 12
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: oh sweet goodness
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: So he was for sure GONE
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Lord have mercy on his soul
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: (He went back out to f after I walked him all the way to sentelle so he could go to bed)
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: So we called campo
11/3/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: And they made me admit Harry had been drinking which was why we needed him to unlock the loun now and it couldn‚Äôt wait
11/3/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: And he opened the door and turned the lights on
11/3/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: And Harry say straight up and was totally fine
11/3/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: But he had been DEAD asleep
11/3/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: The cop told us to go to bed and this never happened
11/3/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: And no I‚Äôm pretty sure it was on the floor
11/3/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know for sure as I was not there
11/3/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: That sounds wild and unfortunate
11/3/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Well, could be worse I guess
11/3/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Definitely an adventure though
11/3/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: A memorable night, even if Harry doesn't remember it
11/3/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Idk if Harry doesn‚Äôt remember it
11/3/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: But yeah
11/3/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Not a bad ending
11/3/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: Also kind of funny
11/3/19, 5:58 PM - Marianna: With the whole ME and max thing
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: is the emphasis on you intentional or not
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Because if it is, I feel like theres more here
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: No ME is Mary Elizabeth
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: We call her
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: M
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: E
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: ...ahaaaaaaaa
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: Okay gotta go to Brussels
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: See ya
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: M(ary)E(lizabeth)
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Gotcha
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Marianna: Szia**
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: See you! Let me know when you land
11/3/19, 5:59 PM - Caleb: Have a nice flight
11/3/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Thank you for hat
11/3/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: That
11/3/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Hi from Belgium!
11/3/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Hello!
11/3/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: The back story is that I was going to go to Dublin with Hannah, hans, and Eskil, but then I realized my dad was coming
11/3/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Oof
11/3/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Idk what you can say to that
11/3/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: And we decided to go to Olof and Anna instead, because that felt really important
11/3/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: And I forgot to tell Hannah
11/3/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: And I thought you know, an AirBnB wouldn't be too much if they shopped around and got somewhere maybe a little farther and cheaper
11/3/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: But nope, they got a $200 a night AirBnB
11/3/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: How
11/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt even seen those anywhere I‚Äôve looked
11/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs crazy
11/3/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/3/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Did they tell you how much it would be before?
11/3/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Is it reasonable to offer to pay the difference for a comparable 3 person AirBnB, and then they split the rest
11/3/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Nope, I got added to the booking but it didn't list the price
11/3/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/3/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: They could technically cancel still probably and get money abck
11/3/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs kind of inconsiderate to just assume you‚Äôd be fine with a $100 for the weekend Airbnb anyway
11/3/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: I always like triple check when I‚Äôm making plans like that with other people paying parts of it
11/3/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/3/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Whatever though
11/3/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Yeaaaaah
11/3/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs probably looking at options and talking to the others
11/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/3/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Still I know I'm going to get shit about this
11/3/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs sucks when people fall through with plans
11/3/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm sympathetic to her not wanting to change plans just because you can‚Äôt go
11/3/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: But also
11/3/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: She got a really expensive Airbnb
11/3/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: So all them are pretty expensive because they got one smack in the middle of downtown Dublin
11/3/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Like directly in the middle of the city
11/3/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/3/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: Well I guess if that was their priority that makes sense why itd be so expensive
11/3/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: Still absolutely sucks
11/3/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: Can you tell your dad and be like so because you‚Äôre coming, I have to pay this?
11/3/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Idk though my dad would probably not care and tell me I should have planned ahead
11/3/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: In other news
11/3/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: I just heard someone say igen as we‚Äôre waiting to board our flight to Budapest and it made me happy
11/3/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: HOORAY
11/3/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: I'm excited for you to be back
11/3/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: I mean, not for any particular reason besides I'm excited you're excited
11/3/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: Also, I went to talk to Hannah about the Dublin thing
11/3/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: And it's gotten way deeper than Dublin
11/3/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: Oh no what‚Äôs up
11/3/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: On plane #2!
11/3/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: If you want to talk tonight I MAY be able to depending on when I get home
11/3/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: But it also sounds like you‚Äôve got a lot going on
11/3/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: This whole week sounds busy so just let me know when works for you!
11/3/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Bye until Budapest ST!
11/3/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: If you've got time, I'd love it! But it might work better tomorrow if you have work you need to do tonight
11/3/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: I also have a presentation I need to do, so tomorrow might just be better in general
11/3/19, 9:09 PM - Caleb: And have a safe flight! Let me know when you land
11/3/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Hi!
11/3/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: Szia!
11/3/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: I can use Hungarian again!
11/3/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs COLD in Hungary
11/3/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: And by cold I mean 56
11/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: It's only 50 here so I can't roast you for the
11/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: That*
11/3/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Welcome home! How's it feel?
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Oh the bus is 17 minutes away
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: :(
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: I just want to be in my bed already
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: It feels good though
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Although
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: My throat feels a little scratchy
11/3/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm hoping IM not getting sick
11/3/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Haha I have a Playlist called "songs for the longest busrides" for if you want to look melancholaly out the window
11/3/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: But aw that's not fun, I hope you don't get sick either
11/3/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Drink water
11/3/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Oh and vitamin C
11/3/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: With lots of wooder
11/3/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Nah I‚Äôm good but thank you
11/3/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Not feeling melancholy tonight
11/3/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: I may read
11/3/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so far behind on my travel journal but I don‚Äôt think the bus is the right place to write
11/3/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Or I may just chill with my buddies
11/3/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/3/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: I think getting back and cuddling with piglet is the right call.
11/3/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Don't worry about much else
11/3/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre on the bus!
11/3/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Oh but I want to download photos tonight!
11/3/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: But i probably should just go to bed
11/3/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: But if I download them tonight I can go through them tomorrow during class...
11/3/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Faradt vagyok
11/3/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Means I am tired
11/3/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Just giving you your daily Hungarian lesson
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: You should pay attention in class
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Not look at photos that im excited to see
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Also, I don't think it's actually a melancholy Playlist
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: It's more sentimental
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: But anyway
11/3/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: What time are you getting back?
11/3/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Home!
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got my pig!
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm downloading the photos and then sleep time
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: YAY
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Yeah that sounds good
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôve got 6 hours of class tomorrow
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Yaaaaay
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Give piglet a good squeeze then pass out
11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Oh man

11/3/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: No squeeze pig

11/3/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Oh hey
11/3/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: You get to pick a new album
11/3/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Got one in mind?
11/3/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Just like you because I‚Äôm hitting the group running or because you‚Äôre fragile and can‚Äôt be squeezed?
11/3/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: And I was just gonna say we keep the old one
11/3/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: I only listened to it like twice
11/3/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Hitting the ground running
11/3/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Because I didn‚Äôt have my own room
11/3/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: But also fragile considering I feel like garbage rn
11/3/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Noooooo
11/3/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Hey
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt feel good
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: If it‚Äôs physical, remember your own advice
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Shower
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Eat soemthing that makes you happy but won‚Äôt upset your stomach
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Listen to hamilton
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: (Okay that‚Äôs mine)
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: If it‚Äôs emotional, you‚Äôve got me here if you need me
11/3/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: And listen to hamilton
11/3/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: (Also just a me suggestion)
11/3/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/3/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: You're such a sweet person
11/3/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Thank you :)
11/3/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: I'm just pretty congested and I'm out of Sudafed
11/3/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: But my dad is bringing more
11/3/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: And other general cold things
11/3/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Ooooh
11/3/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Booo congesti√≥n
11/3/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the worst
11/3/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs not much to do to fix it expect let it do its thing
11/3/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: When does your dad come?
11/3/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: The 6th!
11/3/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm surviving on caffeine and expectorants right now
11/3/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: They're helping a bit
11/3/19, 11:58 PM - Marianna: Expectorants?
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: Also can we appreciate what my phone did to congestion
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: My plan for when I get sick is just to sleep and drink fluids
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: Like the word above
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: Wow
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: So cultur√©d
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: I either crash and don‚Äôt do anything but take off myself or just suffer through a low level sickness and get hit by the worst after I get what I need to done
11/3/19, 11:59 PM - Marianna: I kn√≥w
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Expectorants are a class of drugs that loosen phlegm and mucous, so it's easier to cough
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: Oh fun stuff
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: Yeah
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: I also like never take medicine besides Advil when sick
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: It's basically to make coughs more productive
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: And woah for real?
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs my panacea
11/4/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: Yup
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: And Gatorade
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: Consider adding tea to that
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: Sometimes
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: Caffeine is a good panecea
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: Nooooooo
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: It's why almost all painkillers contain caffeine
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: Wait really
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Caleb: Yeah
11/4/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: That makes no sense to me for some reason
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Look at the active ingredients of Tylenol, advil, Alive
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Aleve?
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Aleve?
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Caleb: Whatever
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: So should I not take them before bed?
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: I feel like when I have to take Advil the pain and not the Advil keep me up
11/4/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: But maybe it‚Äôs both
11/4/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: Nah it's trace enough that it won't hit you like coffee
11/4/19, 12:03 AM - Marianna: Fun fact we used to think I was allergic to Advil or Motrin
11/4/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: I mean
11/4/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: I used to be allergic to doxycyclin
11/4/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: It's a little less inconvenient though
11/4/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: Also you might have been! A lot of kids grow out of allergies
11/4/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: Yeah it wasn‚Äôt convenient
11/4/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: Well I was sick and my lips puffed up but it might have just been a side affect from sick or honestly any of my other food allergies before we knew about them
11/4/19, 12:05 AM - Marianna: Also I ate a ton of allergens this well
11/4/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: And lived!
11/4/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt tell judy
11/4/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: Wait really? That's great
11/4/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: You think you're outgrowing them?
11/4/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: (Also don't worry your secret is safe with me)
11/4/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: No
11/4/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: They were all cooked
11/4/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: Or I ate only a tiny bit
11/4/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: Like I had a kiwi slice and a pear slice
11/4/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: You ever think about testing your allergies again?
11/4/19, 12:09 AM - Marianna: And cooked some kind of fruit tart
11/4/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: I did last winter
11/4/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: So the list is pretty current
11/4/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Or it might have been spring semester
11/4/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: No woah it was JUNE
11/4/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: I did it when I got back from davidson
11/4/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: OH I remember that
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: So probably not
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: I think you sent me a picture of your arm
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Marianna: Yeah it wasn‚Äôt pretty or fun
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Aw you poor thing
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: So
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Kiwi and pear
11/4/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: How were they
11/4/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt like kiwi
11/4/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt had it since i was very little
11/4/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Probably because I had a reaction when I was little and just thought the way it made me feel meant I didn‚Äôt like it
11/4/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: LOVE pear
11/4/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: The juicier the better
11/4/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: So it was nice but tormenting to have a sliver
11/4/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Okay I need to sleep
11/4/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Goodnight!
11/4/19, 12:17 AM - Caleb: Goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow (hopefully)
11/4/19, 12:17 AM - Caleb: Sleep tight
11/4/19, 1:00 AM - Caleb: Heylo! This is super (but not really) far off, but Lee and I were talking, and in January before tour, I'm gonna drive down to Spartanburg for a few days to hang out with him
11/4/19, 1:01 AM - Caleb: That way I can also move my stuff in without having to do the whole trip in one day
11/4/19, 1:02 AM - Caleb: Would you maybe be up for if I drive though Maryland and we could get coffee or lunch or something? I don't need an answer right now but I just thought would be fun
11/4/19, 1:02 AM - Caleb: Anyway, goodnight! I'm going to bed
11/4/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: As long as I‚Äôm there in Maryland, yes I‚Äôd love that!
11/4/19, 7:23 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôd be really cool
11/4/19, 7:23 AM - Marianna: Perks of living in a pretty straight line down to school
11/4/19, 7:23 AM - Marianna: Also oof I‚Äôm exhausted
11/4/19, 7:37 AM - Caleb: Yeah wait why are you up
11/4/19, 7:37 AM - Marianna: Class at 9am?

11/4/19, 7:38 AM - Marianna: But there is really not much out there
11/4/19, 7:39 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so weird to see a map of Maryland rn
11/4/19, 7:41 AM - Caleb: Yeah but I'll tell you what, if you buy me coffee at your favorite place, we can call it even?
11/4/19, 7:45 AM - Marianna: Okay I can do that
11/4/19, 7:45 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll have to think where I want to take you
11/4/19, 7:46 AM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm still in bed
11/4/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: Hey me too it's fine
11/4/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: But then again I don't have class until 1
11/4/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: So I'm going back to sleep
11/4/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: Night! Have a good class!
11/4/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: Ohhhhhh LUKCY
11/4/19, 8:23 AM - Marianna: Lucky
11/4/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sitting with Hans and his roommate on the train
11/4/19, 8:24 AM - Marianna: And I just kind of am not in the mood to be around people yet I don‚Äôt think
11/4/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Holy cow
11/4/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: I just slept until 11
11/4/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Being sick really takes the wind out of my sails I guess
11/4/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: It felt really nice but I also had things I wanted to do
11/4/19, 11:09 AM - Caleb: Whoops
11/4/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôm proud of you
11/4/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Love yourself
11/4/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Your body is doing what your body needs to do rn
11/4/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: But also rip
11/4/19, 1:08 PM - Marianna: Well I went to class and paid 0 attention but did do webtree and look through photos and email 3 people I needed to
11/4/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: Well now I‚Äôm laying down in the lounge
11/4/19, 1:43 PM - Marianna: My head has started to not subtly hurt
11/4/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Thaaanks
11/4/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: It has not been a productive day for me
11/4/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: I zoned out for half of class
11/4/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: And I'm giving a presentation in the next one
11/4/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: How are you feeling? Do you think you're getting sick?
11/4/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Also I'm sorry it's not a people-day for you
11/4/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: I hope it gets better
11/4/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Oh no
11/4/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Productive Monday‚Äôs are overrated anyway
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the presentation on!  Is this more of the debate?
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: And idk
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: Well
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: My throat felt funny yesterday
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: But now my head just really hurts
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: It's for my complexity of cancer class
11/4/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: And I just found out Barcelona doesn‚Äôt actually work after all
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: NOOOOOO
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm just taking that as a we weren‚Äôt meant to go this semester
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: :(
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: I'm really sorry to hear that
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I will just HAVE to come back
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Ha, guess so
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Spring break next year maybe!
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: It's destiny
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: And ooooh complexity of cancer sounds...complex
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Ha probably not
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Yeah, but it would be fun for you guys
11/4/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Maybe it‚Äôll be my first big Europe trip when I‚Äôm a real grownup
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: S√•r and Mar adventures part 2
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: Oh gosh
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: √Ö was unintentional
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: Thanks Danish
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: Yeah but not exactly cost effective to fly to Europe for a week when we have schoolwork to do too
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: But yeah, that's wild to think about
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre living in the lap of luxury rn
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: I've just come to terms with that I'm not making it to Italy or Switzerland this semester
11/4/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: So I'll have to just make it back some day
11/4/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: But also I want to do more exploring in the US now
11/4/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: We've got some cool stuff ya know
11/4/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: But anyway, every week two people present on research of their choosing
11/4/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Most people decided to do case studies or biology stuff
11/4/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: I chose multi-instance multi-label learning for multi-class classification of whole slide breast histopath images
11/4/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: Yeah!
11/4/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: Grand canon man
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: How have I never gotten there
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: And ooooh now I see why you just said complexities of cancer
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: HWHAT
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: Because I have NO idea what that means
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: But sounds very smart and cool
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: Update
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I can go to yoga tonight which makes me so sad because I haven‚Äôt gone in so long now
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: But my head is not a low level headache
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: It's actually CS! it's a machine learning algorithm that can learn from the way pathologists look at slides, take a bunch of small pictures, and then make a diagnosis off of it
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: So I shouldn‚Äôt push it but ah I want to not feel like all I do is sit around
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: :(
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry about your head
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt that like what you did over the summer...?
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: Uh
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Heads just being a butt
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: I did the preprocessing step of it
11/4/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Stupid head
11/4/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/4/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: ?
11/4/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: So kind of is what I‚Äôm heading?
11/4/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: So it's not my work per se, but it's what my work is intended to make feasible
11/4/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: How bad is it compared to the one you had in the shower?
11/4/19, 3:07 PM - Caleb: Also did you get a nap in?
11/4/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Okay I just recognized words that were similar when you talked about your work IM TRYING
11/4/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: not that bad
11/4/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: That was the worst I‚Äôve ever felt I think
11/4/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: But worse than a normal headache by a good bit
11/4/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: I just feel a bit off
11/4/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: And no not really
11/4/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Laid down for 5 min
11/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: How frequent are your headaches?
11/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Also thank you for trying
11/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: It's actually really sweet and means a lot to me
11/4/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Not often like I usually don‚Äôt have migraines or anything
11/4/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: But when I‚Äôm stress it causes me not to sleep and then I‚Äôll have pretty bad ones
11/4/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Finals week is FUN
11/4/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: but this might also be like lack of sleep
11/4/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not that stressed rn
11/4/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: Oh man
11/4/19, 4:32 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôve decided to make soup this week
11/4/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: Stress and hunger are what get to me

11/4/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Lovely time
11/4/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: I love thought you caught that, sorry for probably spooking you hahaha
11/4/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: But anyway
11/4/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: It was a slow, tired day
11/4/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: The first one back is always the longest
11/4/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: No I didn‚Äôt ACTUALLY think you‚Äôd gone on a date
11/4/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/4/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Good Monday vibes honestly
11/4/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: I'm super happy for you but what does "good Monday vibes" entail exactly
11/4/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Just the slow tired day thing
11/4/19, 7:22 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I are making pasty things
11/4/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Pasty things?
11/4/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: PASTRY
11/4/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: With strawberry and with chocolate
11/4/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: Wow you're full of fun typos today
11/4/19, 7:26 PM - Caleb: That sounds absolutely delicious though
11/4/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: And I haven‚Äôt had anything to drink!
11/4/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Absolutely wild
11/4/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: You MADE THOSE
11/4/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Sweet goodness gracious
11/4/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Wait have i ever sent the most impressive pastry I've ever made
11/4/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Back when I was way more into baking
11/4/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: YES
11/4/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: And no I have not seen this I want to see this
11/4/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: I miss baking man
11/4/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: That's a decent one
11/4/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I can't find other things I made
11/4/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Oh man I went through a baking phase
11/4/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I miss that one
11/4/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: College kinda ended it for me
11/4/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: WOWWWWW
11/4/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Just remember: egg washes on pastries make everything better
11/4/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Oh we did not do that
11/4/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Bummer
11/4/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Next time though
11/4/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: I should honestly get back into it
11/4/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: Now that I know New Dorm kitchens are a thing
11/4/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: The only issue is buying ingredients that you always have tons of leftovers for
11/4/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: So if you wanna go halvsies with me on things like baking soda and baking powder and flour, I'd be delighted
11/4/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: Oooh that might be a great plan
11/4/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Or like vanilla
11/4/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: I bought vanilla for the lagkage and it's literally never going to get used
11/4/19, 7:46 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh and there's this really cute picture of me and zelli when we spontaneously made an entire day out of making pumpkin bread last fall

11/4/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: We used my moms recipe so they tarred like home
11/4/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Vanilla smells sooooooo nice
11/4/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: Sarah really can‚Äôt recognize you without your beard
11/4/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: But the pumpkin bread looks sooooo good
11/4/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Wait what
11/4/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: As in she saw another picture of me without it and didn't think it was me?
11/4/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: You need to convince her I'm Ishti
11/4/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs sitting next to me
11/4/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: Hi Sarah
11/4/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: So she saw the snaps and the baking photos
11/4/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: (nevermind the Ishti plan is off, the jig is up)
11/4/19, 8:11 PM - Marianna: HEY
11/4/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: can we call tonight
11/4/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: If you‚Äôd got a momento
11/4/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Yep! Absolutely
11/4/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I was actually going to ask but then you distracted me with pastries or something
11/4/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: I know
11/4/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: My pastries can be distracting
11/4/19, 8:19 PM - Marianna: I need to shower and I‚Äôm still watching Jane the virgin though
11/4/19, 8:21 PM - Caleb: Uh yes, pastries are very distracting
11/4/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: And sounds good, I need to get some work done for tomorrow anyway
11/4/19, 8:29 PM - Marianna: Oh goodie work
11/4/19, 8:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve been hanging with my pig and my best friend so a nice it‚Äôs gotten seriously better since the 6 hours of school
11/4/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Awwww
11/4/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: That sounds infinitly hygge
11/4/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Meanwhile I think I just found my favorite way of cooking an egg
11/4/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Oh do tell
11/4/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Although we‚Äôre just sitting in the uncomfy chairs in the kitchen
11/4/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Doesn't matter
11/4/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Hygge is where the heart is
11/4/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: Also it's this Japanese style called Tamagoyaki
11/4/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: Where you basically fry it in think layers and roll it over on itself to make like a spiral
11/4/19, 8:44 PM - Caleb: It's like povitica, but with eggs
11/4/19, 8:53 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôve seen that on Instagram
11/4/19, 8:53 PM - Marianna: And I don‚Äôt know what povitica is
11/4/19, 8:53 PM - Marianna: My phone doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a real word
11/4/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/4/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Now it's my turn to educate you on Croatian foods
11/4/19, 9:04 PM - Caleb: Thanks Grandma Grenko
11/4/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: Its this dry, slightly sweet rolled bread with cinnamon and walnuts
11/4/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: It's the best thing ever with a cup of coffee
11/4/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: We have it every year around Christmas
11/4/19, 9:06 PM - Caleb: My family likes to make a lot of Dutch and Croatian foods
11/4/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: üòçüòçüòç
11/4/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: It looks magical
11/4/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: I want to do it and dye the two layers
11/4/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Maybe it colorful
11/4/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: Like a UNICORN
11/4/19, 9:22 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Oh darn didn‚Äôt mean to send that

11/4/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: ü¶Ñ
11/4/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what I meant to send

11/4/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: No
11/4/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Stinky Caleb only
11/4/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/4/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be here
11/4/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: Is now good? Hanne stole the shower from me
11/4/19, 10:01 PM - Caleb: Oh nevermind shower just stopped
11/4/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Okay 5 minutes?
11/4/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah although tbh I‚Äôm falling asleep so this should probably be kind of quick
11/4/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Ah okay
11/4/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: Can we talk more tomorrow if it is?
11/4/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/BA3gIRyvn-k
11/4/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Oh I love it more than I‚Äôve loved any dog tucked into a little bag
11/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Her name is Polly
11/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: She was a sick lil pup with heart issues that Denise rescued
11/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Can I pup nap Polly
11/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: And early on she tried to get us to take her
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I will take her
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Well mar
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know how to deal with sick pups
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: But I will love her
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: You're gonna have to fight Mrs. Grenko for that one
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: Oh no
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: But anyway we said the same thing
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt do that
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: We didn't know how to take care of her, so we left her with Denise
11/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: And now she's healthy, and I quote from my mom, "Itty bitty"
11/4/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: OH AND THEN THERE'S RIGGO
11/4/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Same story different pup
11/4/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: But the most photogenic dog I've ever seen

11/4/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I'd like to point out that he happily wears pajamas
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: And he will definitely melt in your arms
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Hi I‚Äôd like 2
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll take them both
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Sarah has already asked if we can have dashi sleepover in our room next year
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: I can take puppies
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: I'll tell you what
11/4/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Actually having a dog full time in a dorm room sounds like a nightmare
11/4/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: If you're ever in my neck of the woods, I'll let you to Denise's if you want
11/4/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: She loves meeting my friends, I've brought so many people there
11/4/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: But yeah, a big dog sounds like a nightmare in a small room
11/4/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: But Riggo and Polly? üëåüëåüëå
11/4/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Okay bedtime
11/4/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
11/4/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Hey December maybe?  Kind of far from your neck of the woods but I will be flying into philly
11/4/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
11/4/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Thanks for talking
11/4/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: I missed it when I was traveling the world
11/5/19, 7:10 AM - Caleb: I missed talking to you too, it was really nice last night
11/5/19, 7:11 AM - Caleb: And yeah! I feel like when you fly in, your priority is just going to be to get home, but if you think you want to hang out or do anything, I'd love to
11/5/19, 7:12 AM - Caleb: We can feel it out later though, but yeah I'd also be happy to pick you up from the airport if your parents are okay with that
11/5/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: And good morning!
11/5/19, 7:13 AM - Caleb: Getting out of bed was so hard this morning, I was in the middle of a good dream, and my room was cold and crisp and my bed was toasty
11/5/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Wow i oversleep
11/5/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Just gonna home the cleaning lady doenst come early today
11/5/19, 9:03 AM - Marianna: Oh!  What was your dream!  I remember mine for the first time in a long time
11/5/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: Friends and I were traveling and o basically guilted someone working at this club (but it was near davidson) to let us have the vip treatment at the club which is when they give you like a makeover and the girls get to get dressed up as bunnies. But then we also got on a flatbed truck at some point and had the car start moving by itself (it was supposed to be around Halloween) and then there was also a part where we were doing mario kart type stuff to defeat and evil villain
11/5/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt remember more than those vague things
11/5/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: Yeah we can figure it out later but I feel like I‚Äôm definitely gone want to see you but it‚Äôs not super convenient and also I‚Äôm probably gonna just be exhausted but I want to do we can figure it out later
11/5/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: But good morning!
11/5/19, 9:10 AM - Caleb: Wow
11/5/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: Your dream sounds vaguely playboy-ish, but with Mario Kart and pitas
11/5/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: I have no idea what mine was ahahaha
11/5/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: I just remember waking up and being like "NO TAKE ME BACk wait what was going on", but also very happy
11/5/19, 9:13 AM - Marianna: Yeah no that was kind of the vibe
11/5/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve seen a ton of warner girls who dressed as playboy bunnies this weekend
11/5/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: Aw dreams like that are the worst to wake up from
11/5/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: I like NEVER remember mine
11/5/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs kind of cool that I did today
11/5/19, 9:27 AM - Caleb: Ah yes the classic playboy bunny costume
11/5/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Maybe I should go dressed as Hugh Hefner some time, or would that be disrespectful because he's dead
11/5/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Nahhhh it's probably what he would have wanted
11/5/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: I can even go around saying "no seriously I read it for the articles"
11/5/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: Jkjk, I already have a great idea of what to go as next year
11/5/19, 9:29 AM - Caleb: And it's actually possible to do something elaborate again because I won't be traveling with a tiny duffel bag
11/5/19, 9:30 AM - Marianna: I saw people as Hefner and bunnies this year
11/5/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt exactly strike me as a dress-as-Hugh-Hefner type of guy I must say
11/5/19, 9:31 AM - Marianna: Sarah and I know what we‚Äôre gonna he next year
11/5/19, 9:32 AM - Marianna: One of them might involve as much clothing as a playboy bunny honeslty
11/5/19, 9:32 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see if we go through with that one though
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Good luck and keep me updated on that
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Better be creative though
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Says the guy with the low effort cat ears
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: (I had an excuse though)
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: Also HEY check this out
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/85l961MmY8Y
11/5/19, 9:44 AM - Caleb: We watched this in our Neural Nets class and it's the coolest thing ever
11/5/19, 9:46 AM - Caleb: It uses GANs to visualize music in the style of paintings
11/5/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: SO cool
11/5/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: The costume is so creative
11/5/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: It might just go over some people (read: everyone‚Äôs) heads
11/5/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: So we‚Äôd have to explain or just look like we‚Äôre not wearing a lot of clothes to f
11/5/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a trade off and I‚Äôm not sure I would be comfy with it but we‚Äôll see how it all goes
11/5/19, 10:23 AM - Marianna: Also Caleb I really shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to listen to music while I‚Äôm walking around Budapest sometimes I‚Äôll just start dancing or walking so dramatically and I feel sooo cool but I‚Äôm probably a crazy on the metro
11/5/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: Nonono
11/5/19, 11:26 AM - Caleb: You have to watch the video
11/5/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: The music is eh, but the video is what makes it
11/5/19, 11:28 AM - Marianna: I did watch it!!
11/5/19, 11:28 AM - Marianna: It was cool
11/5/19, 11:28 AM - Marianna: That was the SO cool

11/5/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: Hope you weren't late
11/5/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: And do I get a hint at the costume? Or am I just gonna have to wait a year
11/5/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre gonna have to wait a year
11/5/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a fun mathematical concept
11/5/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: And no I wasn‚Äôt
11/5/19, 11:31 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre having a joint Hungarian class rn and it‚Äôs a little painful
11/5/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Just that the new kids don‚Äôt know as much
11/5/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a little amusing for the same reason
11/5/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: Uuhhg
11/5/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: You're cruel
11/5/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: Guess I'll keep mine a secret too then
11/5/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: Also thats kinda funny and sad
11/5/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: But they're trying their best ya know
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: Oh you are cruel now
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: It's gonna be a m a z i n g
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: But I can wait
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: I can be patient
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: Not really
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: But sometimes
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: Talan
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: That means maybe in Hungarian
11/5/19, 11:36 AM - Marianna: And yeah no it‚Äôs not their fault they‚Äôve had 2 weeks less of Hungarian
11/5/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: 2 intensive weeks at that
11/5/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: But hey, it'll all even out in the end when people come back and forget it all
11/5/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: You right
11/5/19, 11:39 AM - Marianna: üò≠

11/5/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: Just for that one
11/5/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: He will always be the other man
11/5/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: I'll try my best not to take it _too_ personally
11/5/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: But hey at least it‚Äôs comforting I have no shot with him
11/5/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: Maybe
11/5/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: Ah but if you did? It'd be 100% over for this hoe right here
11/5/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Oh wow I‚Äôm honored?
11/5/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôd fight a billionaire for me?
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Oh no no I meant I'd be finished
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Id peace out and leave you two to it
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Also I really really don't think he's a billionaire
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Oh
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: :(
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: üòò
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Well then I won‚Äôt fight for him
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: And yeah idk
11/5/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs rich and famous
11/5/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Not my type id thing
11/5/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Think**
11/5/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Ahahahaha I promise I'm not upset or self conscious about yet, you don't need to backtrack
11/5/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: I'm not gonna hold you or Cameron back from fangirling I promise
11/5/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Well it‚Äôs the
11/5/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: True
11/5/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah that probably won‚Äôt stop
11/5/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Cameron thinks he‚Äôs gay
11/5/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: It usually half fangirling and half fighting about if he‚Äôs not but it‚Äôs like eh not really in our control to decide that for him you know
11/5/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Look Mar
11/5/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: We all have dreams
11/5/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Don't break Cameron's heart here
11/5/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Okay
11/5/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: In other news
11/5/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: I'm looking up these things for a subject for one of my classes, and my professors name keeps coming up
11/5/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: I didn't realize but he's actually super important in the field
11/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs super cool
11/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Are the person who has had the prof that assigns readings from his own papers?
11/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I think anne did
11/5/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I once had a prof read aloud from a book he wrote during class instead of lecture
11/5/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: He didn't assign these readings, I was just doing more research on it
11/5/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: And he keeps getting cited or things link to articles he wrote
11/5/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: The same thing happened with my boss the other night actually
11/5/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: I was looking for a topic for the cancer class, and stumbled across a big paper on a gene that we talked about in class called BRAF
11/5/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: And I look in the author list, and it says _M. Feldman_ and I was like WOAH WAIT WHAT
11/5/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Actually it happened twice with him lol, there were two things my professors mentioned in class that it turns out my boss did
11/5/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: Oh but did a davidson prof do that?
11/5/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs actually cool
11/5/19, 12:10 PM - Marianna: On one hand it seems like the community within this articular field is pretty small and you‚Äôve had a pretty good connection with people in it
11/5/19, 12:10 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt have an on the other hand
11/5/19, 12:11 PM - Marianna: It is just interesting that‚Äôs you‚Äôve been able to connect with important people and that your classes seem to actually be related to the work you‚Äôve done and want to do
11/5/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: No no no, these are papers that changed the way cancer is treated
11/5/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Like, these are HUGE papers that are now followed in oncology across the world
11/5/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: Not just my field
11/5/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: And like yeah, they're worth a slide or two in a class
11/5/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: But it's like knowing the guy who worked out QR decomp or something
11/5/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: And I think so
11/5/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: I know Zelli used to complain about a professor who for the whole class, basically just used them to proofread her draft of a book she wrote
11/5/19, 12:17 PM - Caleb: Like they were literally asked to make edits and provide feedback
11/5/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs crazy then
11/5/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: It sounds like there are so any levels of research in cancer field
11/5/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: My academic great grandfather or soemthing is dijkstra who did shortest path algorithm
11/5/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: And oof on one had thats annoying
11/5/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: But I also think I‚Äôd love to be an editor
11/5/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh me too
11/5/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I absolutely love writing
11/5/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I think journalism would be super fun to do
11/5/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: I think comp sci is kind of like writing
11/5/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: But the kind I‚Äôm apparently good at
11/5/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: And it has an explicit purpose!
11/5/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: So you have a blueprint or at least an endgoal of what to write
11/5/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs also why I like debugging
11/5/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/5/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: That's the thing I like about CS and a lot of stem.
11/5/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: It's solutions, and theres always (okay usually) an answer
11/5/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Instead of just asking questions where I feel like there's no point to
11/5/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Also right now I'm messing with my webtree and it's making me pretty nervous
11/5/19, 12:53 PM - Caleb: I dont like last minute adjustments but I feel like it could be better
11/5/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Yeah I love answers man
11/5/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Why I like applied math
11/5/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Also you rock
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: Webtree can suck it
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got awesome classes
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: But if you need to bounce ideas, I‚Äôm on my way home
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: But also I have faith in you to pick what you need
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: It looked like you had a pretty good system the other day
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Well this is what I had
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: And I went and changed a bunch of things
11/5/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: Do we actually have to press submit for it?  I thought we did in the past but I don‚Äôt remember
11/5/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: But then I stressed and changed it back
11/5/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Should genomics go higher up?  Is that harder to get than math modeling?
11/5/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: (Also you don‚Äôt have to listen to me I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best you do)
11/5/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: And are you not trying to take discrete next semester then?
11/5/19, 1:14 PM - Caleb: I figured it's easier to squeeze in because my advisor is teaching it
11/5/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Ooooh
11/5/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how I am with math modeling haha
11/5/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: And she's really really really needing me to take it
11/5/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: So worst case scenario, I go "hey I didn't get it" and she goes "you're taking it"
11/5/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs very fair
11/5/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: All your classes look fun
11/5/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: You see any conflicts?
11/5/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Not that I noticed
11/5/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Having a class with you is gonna be weird
11/5/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: Or at least it‚Äôs a foreign concept to me
11/5/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: But probably not bad
11/5/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: If you get math modeling^^
11/5/19, 1:30 PM - Marianna: Have you had chartier before?
11/5/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Oh also I loved both songs from I said yes that you sent thank you!
11/5/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: I mean
11/5/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/5/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Let's be honest, generally seeing each other on campus is going to be weird in the same way
11/5/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: Considering we've had exactly 0 social interaction before zombies
11/5/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: And thanks for checking, I might swap places with Orgo and genomics, but other than that it's done
11/5/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: And nope, I haven't had Chartier
11/5/19, 2:05 PM - Caleb: Only math prof I've had is Smith
11/5/19, 2:05 PM - Caleb: Should I be aware of something?
11/5/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: I know!
11/5/19, 2:11 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm sooooo excited!
11/5/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs just a little well full of himself
11/5/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: Like he‚Äôll spend half of class talking about work he‚Äôs done in the past
11/5/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: And a little about the real material in the class
11/5/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: And then he‚Äôll also talk about random funny stories
11/5/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: He also starts every class with a funny story so we can get out of whatever we were last thinking about
11/5/19, 2:17 PM - Marianna: Which is really nice for me
11/5/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/5/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: Well that's not the worst thing ever
11/5/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: If I survived Caroll I can survive that
11/5/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Carol?
11/5/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Caroll**
11/5/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: And wow I just named
11/5/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Napped**
11/5/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: And now it‚Äôs dark?
11/5/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: I really dont like this
11/5/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: Oh but I did have a fun dream and wow remembering 2 dreams one day?  That‚Äôs WILD
11/5/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Oh oh oh what was your dream!
11/5/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: That's exciting
11/5/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: You should write them down
11/5/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: It helps you remember more often
11/5/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: And yeah Caroll was my Orgo professor
11/5/19, 4:50 PM - Caleb: Who has a 2.8 on RMP
11/5/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôd heard that
11/5/19, 4:54 PM - Marianna: But my jornal is already my travel journal
11/5/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: And idk sometimes they‚Äôre too weird like just strange they make no sense or I just remember bits of them
11/5/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: And ooooof
11/5/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: I had a prof like that
11/5/19, 4:55 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt remember who
11/5/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: What was the dream though!
11/5/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: And yeah I feel like he wasn't the worst, people didn't like him but I got by pretty well
11/5/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: I actually kinda liked him honestly
11/5/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôll tell you the dream next time I see you
11/5/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Twould be indecent to text üò≥
11/5/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah you did really well in orgo!
11/5/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm on my way to yoga now and it‚Äôs rainy and dark and does not feel like 5 pm This is going to be awful for my night productivity levels
11/5/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/5/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: üòñüòúüò≥üò≥üôà
11/5/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: That's the dream and I already know it
11/5/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: But yeah this isn't gonna be a good night for productivity over here either
11/5/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: What is that FROM

11/5/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: Although I did just buy two bottles of wine for literally less than 4 dollars...
11/5/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Well considering I just saw how many wine bottles you have in your kitchen, I think you're fiiiiiiiiinnnnnneee
11/5/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Did you see my windowsill?

11/6/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Usually post workout sore is the best
11/6/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Not a fan of the joint soreness

11/6/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Muscle soreness is great though

11/6/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Ok! Have fun
11/6/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Also I'm actually liking these two essays, I think they're on fun topics
11/6/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: They both have a lot of freedom
11/6/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: The first is the essay I'm writing about death as a sign of rebirth in the Viking era
11/6/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: So I get to write about viking funerals and Odin and Valhalla and rituals and stuff
11/6/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: And then other is i need to make a walking tour of Copenhagen
11/6/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: And I'm going to do it on the life of S√∏ren Kierkegaard
11/6/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Oh okay makes sense
11/6/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Weird smart people jargon
11/6/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: And yeah those sound like fun essays
11/6/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: And soren!

11/6/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: You got this
11/6/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: Also I gotta say, Sankt Peders Bageri has made the single best cinnamon roll I've ever had
11/6/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: I now see why a tiny family owned bakery has stayed in business for hundreds of years and also sells several thousand of them every Wednesday morning
11/6/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: Are these the wednesday snails?
11/6/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: And they‚Äôre only made on Wednesday?
11/6/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Did I tell you about the Cinnamon roll I had in Berlin?  It had cherry compote (yes I‚Äôm allergic to cherries) and white chocolate (my favorite kind of chocolate)
11/6/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your favorite kind of chocolate?
11/6/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: And man I missed princess bakery while we were away
11/6/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: No you didn't! Glad you survived it
11/6/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And my favorite kind of chocolate is the kind that's in my hand
11/6/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: But really, what forms qualify here
11/6/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: That's difficult
11/6/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: Like, pure chocolate? Or like form of enjoyment such as hot? What about mousse or things like that
11/6/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: Also yep, the Wednesday snails, and yep, only on Wednesday
11/6/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: There are other snails during the week
11/6/19, 1:11 PM - Caleb: But none are that good
11/6/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: No like dark or milk or white
11/6/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Oh I love that there are different snails for different days!!!!
11/6/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: Are those the only options
11/6/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Yes for like basic favorite type of chocolate
11/6/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll ask you favorite kind of ghirardelli chocolate later
11/6/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: There are so many good options there
11/6/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Oh you're gonna hate me
11/6/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: I can't remember the last time I had Ghirardelli chocolate
11/6/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: But okay, between those three types
11/6/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: Milk chocolate
11/6/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: But a little on the darker side
11/6/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: But not quite dark chocolate
11/6/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs gonna change
11/6/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/6/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: You will inevitably eat some ghirardelli chocolate if you keep me around
11/6/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: But okay I respect the chocolate choice
11/6/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Also just because I gotta say it and it's cheesy
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: 'my favorite Ghirardelli chocolate is u cuz ur a snacc'
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: There, I got that out of the way and only regret it a lot
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Ha
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Wow that‚Äôs NEVER been said before
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: But thank you
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt judge you for it
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: I like chocolate jokes
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: _surely_ its original
11/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: I just like chocolate in general
11/6/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: 100% first guy ever to say that to you
11/6/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: But at least I was self aware and mildly sarcastic
11/6/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Okay
11/6/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: What do you say to the claim that white chocolate isn't actual chocolate
11/6/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: I say fuck that and chomp into my white CHOCOLATE bar
11/6/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the best
11/6/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Well a guy hasn‚Äôt ever used it as a pickup line but people have still made jokes
11/6/19, 1:29 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
11/6/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: SOMETHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HAPPENED
11/6/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: WHAT
11/6/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: WHAT HAPPENED
11/6/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: EXCITING SOMETHING?
11/6/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: SO EXCITING
11/6/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 1:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Is that this year?!?!
11/6/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Oh he‚Äôs got his angry eyes but he looks so cute
11/6/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: I mean yeah but not for Halloween
11/6/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: It's okay though
11/6/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs like mother why have you let them do this to me
11/6/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: And I swear he's not trying the angry eyes!
11/6/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: He's a sweetheart
11/6/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: No no I believe you
11/6/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just a cute juxtaposition
11/6/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: ü•∫üëø
11/6/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs it
11/6/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: A picture is with a thousand words
11/6/19, 1:35 PM - Caleb: But I guess emojis are at least 500 then because that perfectly describes it
11/6/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre welcome
11/6/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Update
11/6/19, 1:36 PM - Caleb: Apparently Charlie has a lions mane
11/6/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Like he was groomed like that?
11/6/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Or a mane was put on him?
11/6/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: Put on him
11/6/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: Awww
11/6/19, 1:40 PM - Marianna: No photos of this one?
11/6/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: Am I allowed to have favorites between your dogs or is that still morally reprehensible
11/6/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: Oh wait I misread her text
11/6/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: She _tried_ to find a lions mane to put on Charlie
11/6/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: :(
11/6/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: I still have the mental image though so it's okay
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: uh no you're not allowed to have a favorite
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: They're a package deal
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: :(
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Bummer
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: Okay actually you're not allowed to have a favorite until you meet them
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Maybe next year
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: I get to meet your dogs eventually!!
11/6/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: Yay
11/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Okay I can wait
11/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: I will refrain from getting a favorite until then
11/6/19, 1:55 PM - Caleb: Oh definitely
11/6/19, 1:55 PM - Caleb: Also I'm now realizing I have a favorite
11/6/19, 1:55 PM - Caleb: Is that bad
11/6/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Yes you are definitely not supposed to
11/6/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: I want to know but don‚Äôt tell me I don‚Äôt want to be BIASED
11/6/19, 2:50 PM - Caleb: Pssh
11/6/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: As if you weren't already, you know it's true

11/6/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: I can just send it to my parents for comments
11/6/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: You can send it! I'll take a look when I get the chance
11/6/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Okay!

11/6/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Wait
11/6/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: It took that long?
11/6/19, 3:17 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: They had to fix something for it to come back
11/6/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: But at least they were able to do it today
11/6/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: The two other things that don‚Äôt work in the apartment will be fixed by Monday though

11/6/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: Whoops
11/6/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: And hooray for wine Wednesday, it's saved!
11/6/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Also if Josh is taking a long hot shower with a bottle of wine, you should probabaly check on the poor guy
11/6/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Especially if you hear "sound of silence" or "mad world" coming from the bathroom
11/6/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: Oh would you like to mention you didn‚Äôt have any classes today one more time?
11/6/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: Nah he was mostly kidding
11/6/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: And we would never let him take a whole bottle with him
11/6/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôre the papers going?
11/6/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: I mean, sure
11/6/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Hey did you know I have fun, adventureous, class-free-yet-educational Wednesdays every week?
11/6/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Also I mean okay Josh you do you bud
11/6/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: And papers haven't been worked on a whole lot
11/6/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: I've been working on a presentation for tomorrow, but I'm about to get the bulk of the walking tour done because I'm gonna try to do it with my dad
11/6/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: My dad is as close to a Kierkegaard fanboy as you can get by the way
11/6/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Who is kierkegaard
11/6/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: And don‚Äôt hate me for not knowing...
11/6/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Maybe I should know
11/6/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna ver there‚Äôs no reason I would know
11/6/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: But you can tell me and then I‚Äôll know
11/6/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: And and does he get there today!
11/6/19, 4:27 PM - Caleb: He's a huge guy in 19th century Christian theology
11/6/19, 4:27 PM - Caleb: Probably the biggest of his time
11/6/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: He's also the first existentialist, which is a REALLY interesting transition from his theological background
11/6/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: And nope, I think he leaves tonight and here lateish tomorrow
11/6/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Also I got your essay. How much feedback do you want?

11/6/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: still probably exciting to see him!
11/6/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: And anything!  It needs to be shorter so if you have any suggestions for where to trim or concise-ize I‚Äôd love them
11/6/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: Just don‚Äôt judge me too badly
11/6/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Haha no worries I love editing
11/6/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: And yep! He's from Copenhagen
11/6/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: So I'm gonna kill two birds with one stone, and write the walking tour for my dad
11/6/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs clever
11/6/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Clever boy
11/6/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: Eh

11/7/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Okay have a good class
11/7/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna keep watching Jane the virgin and not doing work
11/7/19, 5:21 PM - Marianna: Ya say
11/7/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: Boy
11/7/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: I gotta say
11/7/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: I'm peeved
11/7/19, 5:41 PM - Caleb: "Some Housing Rules"?
11/7/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Eh
11/7/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Maybe he just didn‚Äôt want to get in a discussion over text so he‚Äôs keeping it vague
11/7/19, 5:46 PM - Marianna: John gold at some point made me very nervous by sending me a ‚Äúhey can we talk sometime tomorrow‚Äù text but then he asked me to spe formal so it was all good
11/7/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: THATS STILL TERRIFYING
11/7/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: Yeah it was also after I asked him to warner formal very drunk
11/7/19, 5:47 PM - Marianna: I miss davidson shenanigans
11/7/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I miss Davidson shenanigans too
11/7/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Oh my goodness what if he just tells me to cough less loudly in the shower
11/7/19, 6:01 PM - Marianna: What
11/7/19, 6:01 PM - Marianna: That would be so random
11/7/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/7/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: I'm just thinking of the weird things it could be
11/7/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm intrigued
11/7/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: Do keep me updated
11/7/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: But it is your business so technically you don‚Äôt have to
11/7/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm intrigued
11/7/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: Hey how‚Äôs your day been
11/7/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Weeeeeeeellllllll
11/7/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: That was awful
11/7/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: Uuuuuh you okay?
11/7/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: I'm fine
11/7/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: Just annoyed they made it happen
11/7/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: So 10 or so days ago I cleaned the bathroom (mostly)
11/7/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: Then a few days ago I noticed I didn't check it off the schedule, so I did
11/7/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: But I forgot to do the last two things
11/7/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: And so they brought it up and said they felt like it's been an unfair distribution of work
11/7/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: And then they brought up me cleaning two days late
11/7/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: Because the kitchen was dirty and I was waiting for people to put away their personal stuff to clean it
11/7/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: And Emma just goes and cleans it without mentioning ANYTHING until it was already done
11/7/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: So then I went and finished cleaning the rest of it and checked it off
11/7/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: And they talked to me about that and told me it was unfair, which it sort of was
11/7/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: So naturally I apologize and agree
11/7/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: And I offer to clean the bathroom again
11/7/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: And then offer to take Emma's weekend for the cleaning in apology and to make it better
11/7/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: And then I say "okay, in the future, can you bring things up as they happen instead of having them build up"
11/7/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: And OH BOY THAT DID IT
11/7/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: I said that instead of Emma doing everything, mention that someone needs to clean
11/7/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: And that instead of Emil coming home and being annoyed that the bathroom is slightly dirty, and Hanne not feeling like she can have guests, shoot me a text and say I might need to finish something up
11/7/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: But then the discussion evolved into "okay but I feel like last time I messaged you about your friend staying over, you didn't take it well and were angry with me"
11/7/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: And then I was like "I thought we were on the same page", and Hanne says "I feel like you're smart, don't believe you didn't know you were breaking the rules"
11/7/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: And so we got into that
11/7/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: So that's how my night went
11/7/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: So anyway that's how my night went
11/7/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: It was about 30 minutes id say
11/7/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: And in the end, they never agrees to being up things as they come up
11/7/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Ah I‚Äôm sorry
11/7/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Like
11/7/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: They had valid requests
11/7/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: The whole thing was just a way bigger deal than it needed to be
11/7/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs what it sounds like
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôve kind of got off on a wrong foot with them and nothings gonna make it better
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: But you leave in less than a month
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Or about a month I guess
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: Meanwhile sarah is trapped on the other side of Budapest
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a little stressed about that
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôve cut pest into two and blocked roads and stopped metros
11/7/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs on the other side
11/7/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm trying to figure out how she can get to this side
11/7/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Whyyyyyyyy did they do that?
11/7/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Is everything okay?
11/7/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Turkey president is here to meet with Hungary president
11/7/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: So lots of security for his caravan from airport and around Budapest
11/7/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: And protests everywhere

11/7/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Well they have a reason to protest these two presidents meetin ya know
11/7/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs literally cut pest in two
11/7/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah that really throws a wrench into getting home
11/7/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: But yeah your roommates sound a little unreasonable
11/7/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Hey can you tell me something good about your day

11/7/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/7/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: If our government could be right on 60% of the things it does, we would be ecstatic

11/7/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Also I know I said this before jokingly, but I actually am sensitive
11/7/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Who am I kidding there‚Äôs no mental math in that class

11/7/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm sensitive or not
11/7/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Is that weird
11/7/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Like I have my moments but I would also consider myself really good at not being affected by things

11/7/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: I'm drinking whiskey with Woo and Derek and were all ranting
11/7/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: And apparently they mentioned my final project idea to Emma, and she, I'm not kidding, said "oh I already live with him, I definitely don't want to work with him"
11/7/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: ALSO WHY THE FUCK DO THE DANES LITERALLY HAVE A SEPERATE SET OF RULES
11/7/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: Oh sorry you were flirting
11/7/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: Is emma another of the Americans?
11/7/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs just rotten
11/7/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: Although I said about the same thing to Devansh about not wanting to work with Hans
11/7/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: But I think I‚Äôm gonna just stick with Hans and jamba in the group and deal with it
11/7/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: You doing okay over there?

11/7/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: Face
11/7/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: But at this point it's resting bitch personality
11/7/19, 9:50 PM - Caleb: She's another American roommate
11/7/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/7/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: It sounds sucky
11/7/19, 9:54 PM - Marianna: Sometimes non davidson people just are sooooo not davidson people
11/7/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: I don't have to see them after a month
11/7/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Besides Hannah and Reid
11/7/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: And I actually like them
11/7/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Well Hannah‚Äôs from pa and Reid‚Äôs from Charlotte so you should be able to see them again!

11/7/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Hopefully it will actually happens
11/7/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôd probably be very disappointed in the davidson party scene
11/7/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Hey how are ya
11/7/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Are ya in bed yet
11/7/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Nope
11/7/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: We've moved to the bodega
11/7/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: We're now talking about kinks
11/7/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: I cherish these nights
11/7/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: They're doing the bdsm test
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Aww it‚Äôs a really good point in friendship when you all can do that together
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Not even I‚Äôve done that with my abroad friends
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I love Derek and woo
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna miss them sincerely
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: There's not a lot of people I would say that about
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Awwww
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Well
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt make me send you a wicked song
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: It might make you cry
11/7/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs so weird that we‚Äôre at a point in our life where the people we can become friends with are temporary
11/7/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Not to sound doom and gloom
11/7/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs 9 months of school friends with some sprinkling of home friends when we visit home
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: And then 3 months of new people in a new city wherever we are for the summer
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: And then now it‚Äôs 5 months abroad with people from all over
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: I am in bed and tired
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: So goodnight
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: STOP
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: SORRY
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: There are people at Davison I'm gonna be friends with for life
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: it‚Äôs just an observation
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: And I know it
11/7/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: I believe that
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: I also just can‚Äôt think about not seeing some of them everyday or even regularly
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: But I do need to sleep
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Drink more beer it‚Äôll make you feel better
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Enjoy your time with your friends that will make you feel even better than the beer
11/7/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Goodnight Caleb!  Talk to ya tomorrow!
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Talk to you tomorrow
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: And once more
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Happy miniversary
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Idk
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: I'm sappy
11/7/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: I like things like that I guess
11/8/19, 12:37 AM - Caleb: Aright
11/8/19, 12:37 AM - Caleb: I'm in bed
11/8/19, 12:38 AM - Caleb: I just wanna say I'm sorry you had to deal with me angry about Emma and Emil and Hanne
11/8/19, 12:38 AM - Caleb: It's not fun and I know that
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: I need to let go and move on
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: Because right now all im seeing is the bad in them and the things they've done to wrong me
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: Oh gosh I sound like my mom
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: Anyway
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: Thanks for dealing with my ass tonight
11/8/19, 12:41 AM - Caleb: You always make me feel better
11/8/19, 12:42 AM - Caleb: Goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow/today!
11/8/19, 1:25 AM - Marianna: Miniversary?
11/8/19, 1:25 AM - Marianna: But hey I can be sappy too
11/8/19, 1:28 AM - Marianna: And I really don‚Äôt mind. I feel bad that I can neither be there to help you and help the situation but hey I believe you can live one more month with them and still enjoy you‚Äôre time in Denmark. However I am so sorry that you apartment is not exactly the safe comforting spot it should be for you. But hey it sounds like you‚Äôve got great friends with you there so don‚Äôt forget about that.
11/8/19, 1:28 AM - Marianna: You always make me feel better too
11/8/19, 1:29 AM - Marianna: My update is I keep waking up from nightmares like I did all during my nap and like 2 times tonight and I‚Äôm really not happy about it but don‚Äôt know what to do because I don‚Äôt think I can do anything yay
11/8/19, 1:29 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna try to sleep again
11/8/19, 1:29 AM - Marianna: Goodnight part 2
11/8/19, 1:34 AM - Marianna: But wait random fun fact about marianna time: I used to love the food network show ‚Äúhow things were made‚Äù that went to factories of different candies and such and showed the process so I‚Äôm watching clips of those to calm down and it‚Äôs bringing me back man
11/8/19, 7:44 AM - Caleb: Aw I'm sorry you're having nightmares still
11/8/19, 7:44 AM - Caleb: And I remember that show! I used to watch it when I was sick
11/8/19, 7:50 AM - Caleb: There was also one on the Discovery Channel that I used to love, it was called "How Its Made" and its just so rhythmic and mesmerizing and I learned so much
11/8/19, 8:00 AM - Marianna: Oh then I googled!  Unwrapped is the name of the food/candy one
11/8/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: Yes both were amazing
11/8/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: Automation is just magical you know
11/8/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: Also dangerous because it‚Äôs stealing jobs but whatever
11/8/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: Just don‚Äôt let the robots win caleb
11/8/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: Good morning!
11/8/19, 8:01 AM - Marianna: Awfully is early to start discussing the perils of an imminent robot takeover but hey it‚Äôs Friday so why not
11/8/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: UNWRAPPED
11/8/19, 8:10 AM - Caleb: I vaguely remember that!
11/8/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Yeah ugh good show
11/8/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: I can picture the diner where they started every episode
11/8/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Anyway what‚Äôs your day looking like today?
11/8/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: Woah, two shows on common? Maybe movies is just the wrong field
11/8/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: You watch a lot of PBS as a kid?
11/8/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: And I've got class and then to Gothenburg!
11/8/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: We have definitely talked about the pbs thing
11/8/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: Cyber chase
11/8/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: And yay!  Sounds like a good weekend plan
11/8/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: How long is the train ride out there?
11/8/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: I feel like this was a soda shop topic
11/8/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: But YESSS
11/8/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: VYBER CHASE
11/8/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: Oh yes
11/8/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Miss soda shop
11/8/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I miss Union sandwiches
11/8/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: Ok, question.
11/8/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: I woke up this morning and was still really angry at Hanne, Emil, and Emma
11/8/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: But mostly Hanne
11/8/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Is it worth typing up something saying I feel like my voice wasn't heard and it felt unfair, and that I doesn't feel like a real resident of my own flat because I literally have a different set of rules, and then bring up the shower thing
11/8/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: Or should I just let sleeping dogs lie and ride out the semester
11/8/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: And also that I do work, and clean up the kitchen even if it's not my mess sometimes, and I just don't advertise it
11/8/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: I always figure that if I go to bed and wake up, and I'm fine, it wasn't a real issue and I was just emotional about it
11/8/19, 11:40 AM - Caleb: But since I woke up and it's still really upsetting me, I'm wondering if it's worth addressing
11/8/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm just kind of a person that would rather not bring it up again because in my opinion I would just feel like whiny and I would want to appear strong and not like defensive. But that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm not really a person that needs closure like when something happens I‚Äôm not gonna bring it up if someone else doesn‚Äôt. I can handle that stuff internally more. But I think you‚Äôre more of a person who wants to talk it out with people. If you feel like that‚Äôs how the situation needs to go, I support that for you. It‚Äôs not what I would do but if you woke up this morning like this, then I think it might be healthier if you did say what has been bugging you.
11/8/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: That could be absolutely crap advice
11/8/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs all good points that they haven‚Äôt entirely been fair and they genuinely may not know you clean when you‚Äôre not asked. That‚Äôs the kind of things people don‚Äôt see. They only se when you DONT do something.
11/8/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: And the shower this is a good point. It seems to me like they‚Äôre ganging up on you and that‚Äôs not good at all. Having a safe and comfy home to come back to where you don‚Äôt have an awful relationship with your roommates is really important especially when you can‚Äôt just run to a friends room like at davidson
11/8/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Hey this should cheer you up
11/8/19, 12:56 PM - Marianna: Our comp bio prof you met has pet shrimp but he wants to sequence their dna because they‚Äôre super inbred he thinks and he‚Äôs very curious what the dna will look like but he‚Äôs too _emotionally attached to them he doesn‚Äôt know which ones to kill and use their dna_
11/8/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah, I don't want to seem whiny, but at the same time I got absolutely walked all over because it was 2 on 1
11/8/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: And it's just like ugh
11/8/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Whatever
11/8/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: I'll just drunkenly rant to vent at some time randomly in the future
11/8/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Re your comp bio prof
11/8/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: Thats adorable
11/8/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: And also kinda sad
11/8/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: They say curiousity killed the cat
11/8/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: But apparently not the shrimp?
11/8/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs not fair of them
11/8/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm mad at them for it
11/8/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: But I may be a little biased
11/8/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: Feel free to always drunkenly or soberly rant to me
11/8/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: Or just talk to me
11/8/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mind it all that much I guess
11/8/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah he‚Äôs an odd one but it‚Äôs kinda cute
11/8/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Some are getting old anyway
11/8/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Sooo
11/8/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: I'm freeeeee
11/8/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Yaaaaay
11/8/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: That class was SO long
11/8/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: There's a guy in it that asks so so many pointless questions
11/8/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: And I'm fine with asking a question out of personal curiousity here and there
11/8/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: But it's literally about 1/6 of the class time spent answering them
11/8/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Maybe more
11/8/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: So it just feels like it's dragging on and we don't cover anything
11/8/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/3j27ICB7eO4sOPSm4BLPj1?si=P5CmBwDNRF-WpuxqxSCnyQ
11/8/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: COBGRATS
11/8/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: I have another hour of class
11/8/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Magyar√≥ra
11/8/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: (Hungarian class)
11/8/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs how Keara is in theory. You actually met her at lunch when you were here. She‚Äôs the one I can‚Äôt stand working with or being in class with because of all her questions for the prof just to literally repeat things one more time
11/8/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a big fan of don‚Äôt hold the whole class up. There are opportunities after class to ask about things
11/8/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Or office hours sometimes
11/8/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: Oh no
11/8/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: I'm not saying he asks for clarification
11/8/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: He'll just pick the weirdest, most out there tangential take on the topic
11/8/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: So like out of the blue, he'll ask "is there any cultural significance behind birch trees in Nordic mythology?"
11/8/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Which is a fine question if it wasn't one of the 14 he asks every day in class
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Ooooh
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Well that‚Äôs kind of interesting
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: I don't dislike him, it's just inconvenient
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Peoples brains man
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: They work so weird
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Peoples brains
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Brian‚Äôs
11/8/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/8/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: I know he can't help it either, I'm pretty sure he has aspergers
11/8/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: But I wish the professor would have more control over it
11/8/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah but that‚Äôs kind of out of everyone‚Äôs control
11/8/19, 3:00 PM - Marianna: But it can still be frustrating
11/8/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: I mean, no, you just have to be explicit in accepting questions
11/8/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: It also doesn't help with the professor alone can barely keep on subject
11/8/19, 3:00 PM - Caleb: I love ya Morten but come on man
11/8/19, 3:05 PM - Marianna: Oh Morten
11/8/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve gotten marti off topic and made her teach us some random words
11/8/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good
11/8/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: Okay gotta go
11/8/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: Have fun doing whatever you‚Äôre doing in the next hour
11/8/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: :)
11/8/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: Oh no I forgot my dad is embarrassing to travel with
11/8/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: Ahhaaaaahhh it's fiiiiiine
11/8/19, 3:30 PM - Caleb: It's funny though
11/8/19, 3:31 PM - Caleb: You can tell he hasn't taken a metro in a long time, or just doesn't know how to
11/8/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Because I had to walk him though how to use the card, standing on the right in the escalator, and getting out of the way to let people leave
11/8/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: And then I remembered that was me in DC
11/8/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Sorry I put you though that haha
11/8/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: Oh but I want to clarify that's not why he's embarrassing
11/8/19, 3:51 PM - Caleb: He just talks very slowly and clearly and makes a lot of handmotions like they can't understand English
11/8/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: My mom is like that
11/8/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: Hey you weren‚Äôt too bad in dc
11/8/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: I do recall you admitting you were flustered about the metro
11/8/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs okay
11/8/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: I honeslty don‚Äôt miss the metro
11/8/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: Usually I do
11/8/19, 3:51 PM - Marianna: But Budapest metro is so much cheaper
11/8/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: And also he pulls the typical "American in foreign country" move and talks about life in America to strangers without them asking
11/8/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: Gotta say though, traveling with my mom is great though
11/8/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: It's good traveling with both of them I guess
11/8/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: My mom doesn't try to embarass me though
11/8/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: (yes he tries and I say this with utmost certainty)
11/8/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: Yup sounds like my mom
11/8/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: And she gets VERY flustered when people don‚Äôt speak English not like offensively just she doesn‚Äôt know what to do
11/8/19, 4:26 PM - Marianna: Or she‚Äôll try the language and they‚Äôll be even more confused
11/8/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: But you think your dad tries to embarrass you?!
11/8/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: Also hi!
11/8/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm free now!
11/8/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: Yaaaaay
11/8/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: Gonna nap and make soup and rally and Devansh is throwing a big party
11/8/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/8/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: For example:
11/8/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: He's taking to the woman that we're sitting with, and he asks her about her kids
11/8/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: She mentions she has three daughters: 7,16, and 20 year olds
11/8/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: So naturally, my dad asks "is the oldest one single?" and looks at me with his eyebrows raised
11/8/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: My dad laughed as I gave him a "really? Come on" glare
11/8/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Also yay!
11/8/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Any occasion for the party?
11/8/19, 4:35 PM - Marianna: Oof
11/8/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah my dad and my mom don‚Äôt do that
11/8/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs just a strange question to ask anyone you just meet in any country
11/8/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: And not really he just wanted to do an all AIT party and he‚Äôs hoping less people are traveling this week because people traveled all last week
11/8/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah he just sorta does that
11/8/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: It's pretty awful to witness, but he's just overly friendly and lacking social awareness sometimes
11/8/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: I get to know strangers, but I feel it's got interest and fluidness and it feels really natural
11/8/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: He just kinda bulldozes his way into a conversation
11/8/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: Which is fine because it's harmless and there's no bad intentions, but still it's a dad embarrassing
11/8/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: Tad* embarrassing
11/8/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: And hey that's awesome, hope you have fun!
11/8/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: I've already napped like twice on the train
11/8/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Oh and hello from Sweden!
11/8/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: No not a Grenko being overly friendly
11/8/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: It is dad embarrassing
11/8/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: See what you did there
11/8/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: Hello Sweden from Hungary!
11/8/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: Boooooo
11/8/19, 5:36 PM - Caleb: Good pun
11/8/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: No you‚Äôre a good pun
11/8/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: Thenk ya
11/8/19, 6:06 PM - Caleb: How's it going
11/8/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Good
11/8/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt napped
11/8/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: I need to shower and make dinner
11/8/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Soup!
11/8/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Soup!
11/8/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: Soup!!
11/8/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: What soup
11/8/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/8/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: My plan is to throw things into a pot and see what happens
11/8/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Genuinely
11/8/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see how it goes
11/8/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Just got to m√∂lndal!
11/8/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Also sounds like an exciting episode of Cooking with Marianna
11/8/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Let me know how it turns out
11/8/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Very colorful
11/8/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Very fragrant
11/8/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: So yes it does work to just throw things in a pot and let it simmer
11/8/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: I should have cut the zucchini a little smaller though
11/8/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Woah
11/8/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: Looks like it turned out well
11/8/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: How's your night going?
11/8/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: It was pretty good yeah
11/8/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Good!  Figured out my dining plan and have made it to devanshs
11/8/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: They made berry sangria which is not half bad
11/8/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: And the gin is gone whoops
11/8/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Pong with sangria is next on the menu
11/8/19, 10:47 PM - Marianna: Bud I‚Äôm warning you I‚Äôm gonna end up so drunk tonight
11/8/19, 10:47 PM - Caleb: Okay! Be safe and drink water please!
11/8/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Can I request two glasses of water tonight actually
11/8/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Maybe 3 if you're feeling risqu√©
11/8/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Also as always I welcome any and all drunk texts
11/8/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: I think it's your turn to be drunk tonight anyway üòÅ
11/8/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: I JUST MET ONE OF THE 500

11/8/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: I'm going to go to bed, but send me a bunch of updates from your night and I'll catch up in the morning! (but only if you want to)
11/8/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow!

11/9/19, 5:09 AM - Caleb: I know I say this a lot but _please drunk water when you see this_
11/9/19, 5:10 AM - Caleb: I can't follow a couple of these texts but I still think I got the sentiment behind them, and you're very sweet
11/9/19, 5:13 AM - Caleb: Please don't read them and cringe, they're delightful haha
11/9/19, 5:16 AM - Caleb: I'm really glad you gave good friends who took care of you
11/9/19, 5:16 AM - Caleb: Very very glad

11/9/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so sweet
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd rather drink it than water
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: There are so many snaps of myself I don‚Äôt want to open
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Like in my friend snap groups
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: But I did drink water last night!
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: 2!
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Like you requested!
11/9/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôre you doing?
11/9/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Good! We went on a long walk though a Swedish forest and ranch
11/9/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: I'm pulling the pics off my camera
11/9/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: I'll send them in a bit
11/9/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Also I'm gonna need translation for some of the texts last night hahaha
11/9/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: No no
11/9/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: No translation
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: The work stands for itself
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: And I don‚Äôt want to scroll up and read them
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Sorrrrry
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Oh they're absolute gems
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: No no
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: Can I just quote them here
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt believe that
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: No
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: No no
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Whyyyyy
11/9/19, 12:59 PM - Caleb: This was my favorite
11/9/19, 1:00 PM - Caleb: (and that's where I'll stop teasing you)
11/9/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Hey hey know what will make you feel better
11/9/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Maybe
11/9/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 1:01 PM - Marianna: I honestly really don‚Äôt know what I was saying
11/9/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: The Turkish president is here?
11/9/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: But idk why I‚Äôd actually be texting about turkey
11/9/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: Wow
11/9/19, 1:02 PM - Marianna: CHONKie boy
11/9/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Yeah I've been trying to figure it out from the context, but eh
11/9/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: I wont read too much into it
11/9/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: How did everyone else fair last night? I heard you might have thrown up?
11/9/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah sorry I can‚Äôt solve the mystery of your favorite drunk text
11/9/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: And everyone was v drunk
11/9/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: More like v v v v drunk
11/9/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Devansh threw a good party
11/9/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: A lot of people there I didn‚Äôt know
11/9/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: Because choezin had a lot of friends in town
11/9/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: And then some bsm kids came too!
11/9/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: And some others had friends in town
11/9/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: I did throw up...
11/9/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt black out sooooo there‚Äôs that
11/9/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Honestly when I throw up I wish I was blacked out
11/9/19, 1:12 PM - Caleb: Man I don't want to remember that
11/9/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: Also funish fact, I have a super tale-tell sign of when I threw up the night before
11/9/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: It honeslty wasn‚Äôt that bad like it was over and then I just felt very drunk but no longer nauseous
11/9/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Uh okay what is it?
11/9/19, 1:14 PM - Caleb: I rupture tiny blood vessels under my eyes and get little red dots
11/9/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: Oh and also I'll just look like garbage the whole next day
11/9/19, 1:16 PM - Caleb: Oh man it's the worst though when you just want to sleep but the room keeps spinning
11/9/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: Oh wow
11/9/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Is that like a not healthy thing?
11/9/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Like I feel like rupturing blood vessels can‚Äôt be good
11/9/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: It's just because I shut my eyes so hard that it breaks them
11/9/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: And yeah I can fall asleep remarkably well when drunk
11/9/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: It goes away after like 24 hours
11/9/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: Okay but there's a curve to that
11/9/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Like I did put the album on last night but I don‚Äôt think I lasted more than the first song
11/9/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: There's no linear association with getting drunk and sleeping well
11/9/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: For me I think there is
11/9/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Which is definitely not healthy but whatever
11/9/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sleepy always though so it doesn‚Äôt take much
11/9/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh I just saw common food photos on Instagram and now I really want to go to commons
11/9/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: I miss my routine from davidson
11/9/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Which includes hungover commons omelettes on the weekends
11/9/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: y= -(x-4)^2/4 +8
11/9/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I think that's the model for me
11/9/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Y is hours of good sleep
11/9/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: X is number of shots
11/9/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: It's probably actually a fourth degree polynomial but I'm not doing that by hand
11/9/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Oooh oh send me the food photo! I'm excited for new commons stuff when I get back
11/9/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: Interesting
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: Well it‚Äôs the davidson eats account which posts commons hacks
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: But I WANT MY OMLETE
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: I really don‚Äôt know how to make omlettes
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: I should get up and make scrambled eggs
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: And toast
11/9/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: But no toaster
11/9/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: But what I really wnat is a tub of peanut butter and a commons omlete
11/9/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Just throw the bread on the pan before you cook the eggs
11/9/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: No butter, no oil
11/9/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Uh are you sure you're not still drunk
11/9/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: That sounds like drunk food
11/9/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Some good ol late night
11/9/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: I definitely was when I woke up at 7 this morning
11/9/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: But no I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not now
11/9/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: I miss late night too!
11/9/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: I really think having to make all the decisions about classes and rooming and meal plans for next semester has just set me into wanting it to be next semester already
11/9/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: Yeah when you start having to deal with logistics, you start wanting it to pay off
11/9/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: It's good you're looking forward to it
11/9/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: It's the Grenkoian good times curve
11/9/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: For all y < 0, y =0
11/9/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: After about 12 drinks my night quickly declines
11/9/19, 1:41 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Gotta love a good horse in a sweater vibe
11/9/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: And wow I wonder if we‚Äôll learn about Grenkoian good times formulas next semester in math modeling
11/9/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: My update is I‚Äôm back in bed
11/9/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Have you done anything besides the walkabout on the farm today?
11/9/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Hey it might not be on the study guide, but it depends how our study sessions go :)
11/9/19, 3:33 PM - Caleb: Of course there's no solution to the system of equations if paired with the Ghirardelli drunkness curve
11/9/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: They're orthogonal apparently
11/9/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: I love that
11/9/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: When he speaks math to you üò´
11/9/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: What can I say
11/9/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: I just want you to think I'm cute and can speak math
11/9/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/9/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs thought
11/9/19, 3:36 PM - Marianna: You win
11/9/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: :)))
11/9/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: And it's been a fun day! We walked about 10k, came back, I napped, read, and we had dinner now
11/9/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: Now we're heading to a jazz concert
11/9/19, 3:39 PM - Caleb: And ice cream and wine after
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: Oh what are you reading again?  I think you told me but I don‚Äôt remember...
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: Oooh
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: Ya like jazz?
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: üôÉ
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt actually know what that‚Äôs from
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: Is that just something you say?  I feel like I‚Äôve heard it from other people
11/9/19, 3:41 PM - Marianna: And ice cream AND wine
11/9/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Decadent
11/9/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Treat yo self
11/9/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: I am not drinking tonight
11/9/19, 3:42 PM - Marianna: Maybe
11/9/19, 3:57 PM - Caleb: Ya I like jazz
11/9/19, 3:57 PM - Caleb: How did ya know
11/9/19, 3:57 PM - Caleb: And I'm reading American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis
11/9/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: It's intense
11/9/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: And TREAT YO SELF
11/9/19, 3:58 PM - Caleb: I mean will do it thanks
11/9/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Idk soemthing about the fact that I can see your spotify music and there‚Äôs a lot of jazz going on there
11/9/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Sorry boot it
11/9/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: The noise outside our apartment is insane and has been all day
11/9/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm honestly shocked how often they do construction or something
11/9/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/9/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Construction
11/9/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: A classic
11/9/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: Also this was in the COOLEST venue
11/9/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: Also this reminded me
11/9/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: There's a jazz club in Charlotte that I went to once, and it was absolutely fantastic
11/9/19, 5:05 PM - Caleb: Would you want to go with me at some point next semester?
11/9/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: Yes yes yes!
11/9/19, 5:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never been to a jazz club
11/9/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôve reached PEAK marianna form I‚Äôm still in my pjs eating cheese and watching Netflix at 5pm on a Saturday
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: _I don't think I've ever been more attracted to you than this sentence right here_
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: Peak Marianna sounds peak comfy, you should invite me next time :)
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: The jazz club was in this old textile mill spanning the little river I sent you
11/9/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: We sat on a red metal catwalk, listened to jazz, drank wine, and saw the art exhibit inside it too
11/9/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: Well maybe not next time
11/9/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs only because it will definitely happen again this week
11/9/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: And sadly you‚Äôre in Sweden
11/9/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: But that looks sooooo cool!
11/9/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: How was the music!
11/9/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: But definitely some time
11/9/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: Music was good!
11/9/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: It was a trio with a bass, piano, and a violin/vocalist
11/9/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: And I liked her singing a lot
11/9/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: It was kind of dedicated to Duke Ellington, so I knew a few songs
11/9/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: But it was honestly just a lot of fun
11/9/19, 5:40 PM - Caleb: We just got back
11/9/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Oooooh sounds nice
11/9/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Do you like music better when there are violins?  Strings in general?  Any jazz?  Vocal jazz?
11/9/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs pouring outside
11/9/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: And my windows are open
11/9/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: So hygge Caleb you‚Äôd be so proud
11/9/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: Well
11/9/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: Thats a complicated question
11/9/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: I like music when I like it
11/9/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: I wasn't a fan of the violin because I thought it wasn't great violin, that's it
11/9/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: But I LOVE gypsie jazz
11/9/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: The violin is so wild and fun
11/9/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: I think you'd like it too actually
11/9/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/7t3xBqAWLaU
11/9/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Like this
11/9/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: That's my favorite jazz recording EVER
11/9/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: The violin is so crisp and playful
11/9/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: The bass also only has 3 strings which is super odd
11/9/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: And the bassist is a Korean tourist who joined, so the whole thing is improv
11/9/19, 6:43 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs fair
11/9/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: I just know when I like soemthing I don‚Äôt think I can generalize with what music I like either so that‚Äôs fair
11/9/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll try to listen to it tonight!
11/9/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm heating up SOUP
11/9/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: although all the liquid got absorbed overnight so it‚Äôs more like a veggie pasta dish now
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: But I tried to revive it and put a ton of water in it to make it more soupy
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Honestly a veggie pasta dish doesn't sound too bad
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: And idk
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: I feel like it's hard to generalize anything I like
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: It's just stuff that has depth to it
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/9/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: But I wanted SOUP
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: it looks pretty okay
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: And if I know someone passionate about something I can get REALLY into it
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: The broth is a little more watery than last night but whatever
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Eugh
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: I don't like watery broth
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: Well
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt make you eat it then
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: It's gotta be flavorful
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: ü•∫
11/9/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: noooooo save some for me pleaaaaaaasseeee
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: Take it as your carry on
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: No
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: But only 4 oz or something
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: No
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: A hip flask of soup
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: You insulted my watery broth
11/9/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Well I can take the stuff without the broth and then add water
11/9/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: Which is what I just did
11/9/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs more than 4 oz
11/9/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs really not terrible
11/9/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Hmmm sounds fake but ok
11/9/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: Not Jane
11/9/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: She looks a little ridiculous
11/9/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Actually looks quite good
11/9/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: I'll admit it
11/9/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: And so does Jane
11/9/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: HA
11/9/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: gotcha
11/9/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: How's the show going
11/9/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: How's your lazy Sunday going
11/9/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: How are you
11/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Shows going well
11/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs Saturday
11/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: So
11/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your lazy Sunday going
11/9/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good though
11/9/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: This soup really ain‚Äôt bad
11/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Oh thank goodness thats right it's Saturday
11/9/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: It's good!
11/9/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: My dad harassed me into showing pictures of my trips
11/9/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Which is fine
11/9/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt like showing him pictures of your trips?
11/9/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: If Budapest wasn't explicitly requested because of you
11/9/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Which just makes me feel awkward
11/9/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: And not because of you
11/9/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: I promise
11/9/19, 6:59 PM - Caleb: It's just weird having my dad pressure me about my love life
11/9/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Ha he seems like he wants to get involved
11/9/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Between all the trying to set you up
11/9/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: And asking questions
11/9/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: But idk
11/9/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Invasive questions aren‚Äôt fun I guess
11/9/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think I'd feel better about it if he didn't joke about setting me up or didn't try to embarass me with it
11/9/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: My parents have been weirdly not invasive
11/9/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm sorry
11/9/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Honestly this is a big reason why I didn't really date in high school
11/9/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: I never wanted to take someone home
11/9/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: And so I'd just hang in a flirting/semi dating limbo until they got too frustrated and we parted ways one way or another
11/9/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Sorry I'm wine-tipsy and complaining
11/9/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: I'll stop
11/9/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Oh I‚Äôm sorry
11/9/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: No I like you talking
11/9/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: You can complain
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Did you get your hat back!
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Nope no one likes a complainer
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Caleb
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: And yes! I did! Reunited at last!
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: I live in Hungary
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: We complain here
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre brutally honest
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's lame sorry about that
11/9/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: It's fine being honest
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a transactional honestly thing
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: I complain to you
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: But have a honest-but-healthy perspective
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: You complain to me
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Well
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Thanks for letting me complain
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: I'm finished for the night though
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: If you want you can ask me more about it in person
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: But you don‚Äôt have to be
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: For now I'm going through all my Budapest photos and sanitizing
11/9/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Complaining
11/9/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: Sanitizing?
11/9/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: Oh I need to write my letter about my vacation to my family
11/9/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: It's a cute picture but not one I want my parents to see
11/9/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/9/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah that makes sense
11/9/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my girlfriend with two bottles of wine we drank all of on a Wednesday‚Äù
11/9/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I do really like that photo though
11/9/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Oh I do too
11/9/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I feel like my eyes look weird though
11/9/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Do you prefer the word photo or picture?
11/9/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: I really like the black and white one too
11/9/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: I use photo for a physical item
11/9/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Picture for digital or otherwise
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Interesting
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Oh and then we got yelled at for photos
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Or pictures
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: THAT'S RIGHT
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Or whatever you want to call them
11/9/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: That was odd
11/9/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/9/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Miss budapest shenanigans
11/9/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Man
11/9/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: What am amazing week
11/9/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Hey

11/9/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh
11/9/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Yeah I didn‚Äôt know I could have so much fun all while in Budapest
11/9/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: In ONE WEEK
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: I love that gif
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Marianna: Good gif
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: I've had that one in pocket for a while
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: I feel like it was the right time
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: But yeah, that was absolutely an adventure
11/9/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: I don't think I'll ever forget that week
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Good good
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: The company really made it too üòò
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Oh sarah?
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Yeah she‚Äôs the vest
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Best
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: And her roommate is also kind cool too I‚Äôve EHAT
11/9/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: Heard**
11/9/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not drunk but my phone is still calibrated to drunk Marianna‚Äôs texts so it still cant spell
11/9/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/9/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Also dude I have so much soup
11/9/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna last forever
11/9/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Update
11/9/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Olof and my dad were talking while I was waiting to show pictures
11/9/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: But Anna came down
11/9/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: So I showed anna all of the Budapest pictures
11/9/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: It was very fun
11/9/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Oh yay!
11/9/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: I love showing people pictures
11/9/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: Yep
11/9/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôll give a slideshow anywhere and everywhere and tell the stories of all the stuff in the photos and all
11/9/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: And now I get to give it again
11/9/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: But with less detail on everything because I already gave it once
11/9/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: And ya snooze ya lose
11/9/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Ooof harsh artist Over here
11/9/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Kidding
11/9/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: But China took like 45 minutes
11/9/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: So let's see how awake they are
11/9/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: We needed to take a snack break
11/9/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: Partly their fault, they complained I was moving too quickly
11/9/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: Woah Olof randomly brought up the 50th anniversary of the moon landing
11/9/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: You mean that time they filmed the moon landing and lied to the american public to show Russian who was bigger?
11/9/19, 9:08 PM - Marianna: And today was the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall falling too
11/9/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: Omg Sarahs conference paper notification should have been today
11/9/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs been out of the house for like 5 hours
11/9/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to text her in case it was bad
11/9/19, 9:10 PM - Marianna: I really hope she got it
11/9/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: You should probably shoot her a text, I really hope she got it too!
11/9/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: Okay I texted her
11/9/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Let me know!
11/9/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Also
11/9/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: _if you are receiving this message,...._
11/9/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: ;)
11/9/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very much kidding
11/9/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: I wanted to see what you‚Äôd do
11/9/19, 9:14 PM - Caleb: I feel like of all the conspiracies, that's the dumbest
11/9/19, 9:14 PM - Caleb: That's absolutely the most far fetched
11/9/19, 9:15 PM - Caleb: We all know the moon is fake anyway
11/9/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: Caleb
11/9/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: The tides
11/9/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: It can‚Äôt be fake
11/9/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: The tides
11/9/19, 9:19 PM - Marianna: No I think bush did 9/11 is the most far fetched
11/9/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Wait
11/9/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Have you never heard of operation Northwoods
11/9/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods
11/9/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: I don't think Bush did 9/11
11/9/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: For the record
11/9/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: No I have not heard of it
11/9/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: Oh wow that‚Äôs fucked up
11/9/19, 9:31 PM - Marianna: People suck man
11/9/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: Hi!  Finally wrote up a little summary of my trip!  It‚Äôs a GIANT pdf because it has photos in it. I‚Äôm gonna send you the Dropbox link
11/9/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: If you want to look at it
11/9/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: But you don‚Äôt have to
11/9/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: I've done it
11/9/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: A full month of travel pictures covered
11/9/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: And it only took about 4 hours
11/9/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: But yeah, Northwoods was really messed up
11/9/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: I don't think anything ever came of it, or anything like it
11/9/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: But it's still terrifying that someone high in the DoD thought it was a good idea, and it literally got to the desk of Kennedy before it was rejected
11/9/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: And it's one of the things we now know about
11/9/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: And awesome! I'll absolutely take a look
11/9/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: It's been long awaited
11/9/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Oh wait it's 50mb
11/9/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Whoops
11/9/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: Maybe I shouldn't have downloaded that over 4g
11/9/19, 10:47 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Oh wow that‚Äôs a really long time
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: And oh sorry I should have told you
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs really large
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: All good
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Which is why I had to Dropbox link it
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Yeaaaaaah
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: And that was the illusion museum!!!
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: What's done is done
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: It was soooooo cool
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Also
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: SARAHS GOT ACCEPTED FOE JOUNRAL TRACK
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: WHAT
11/9/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: HOLY SHIT
11/9/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Man
11/9/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: That's absolutely incredible
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I'm so happy for her
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: I know I‚Äôm soooooooo proud
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: I got out of bed to come congratulate her
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a big deal today
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I mean
11/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: I don't have much more to say than that
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: It's just an amazing accomplishment and she should be proud
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Wow my friends are so smart
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Maybe she'll remember us one day üò≠
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Doubtful
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Okay you probably
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Me, eh
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll probably have to stalk her and beg her to remember me at some point
11/9/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: You definitely though
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: Chase after her like paparazzi
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Get her autograph while you can
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Before she hires security
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: Oooh good point
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: I can put that I was her personal chef on my resume
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Uh
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: She didn't pay you
11/9/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: But hey exposure or something
11/9/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: But that was essentially my position
11/9/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Update I think I‚Äôm gonna watch one more episode and then head to bed
11/9/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve only been up 10 hours it‚Äôs exhausting
11/9/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm currently in bed
11/9/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: I'm reading for a bit and then going to sleep
11/9/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Yay
11/9/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Two thumbs up for bed
11/9/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: üëçüò¨üëç
11/9/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: Where did the two thumbs up even come from?
11/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Oh geez
11/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: DC I think?
11/9/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: It was something we were joking about happening, but the subject suddenly seemed very to me and I cheesily put two thumbs up and grimaced
11/9/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Maybe it was Ishti
11/9/19, 11:32 PM - Marianna: Yeah we were pretty goofy in dc
11/9/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: Part to deal with the nerves I think
11/9/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: But yeah maybe ishti is involved
11/9/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/9/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: That was a wonderful wonderful weekend
11/9/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: Goofyness and all
11/9/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think we could comfortably chalk it up to nerves on both our parts though
11/9/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Which definitely isn't the worst nervous response
11/9/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/9/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: No one threw up
11/9/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a pretty bad nervous response
11/9/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Hahaha
11/9/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: I felt that
11/9/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Not sure what it was
11/9/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: But I felt something
11/10/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: Okay, I'm going to head to bed now
11/10/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: Goodnight!
11/10/19, 12:21 AM - Marianna: MICHAEL IS ALIVE
11/10/19, 12:22 AM - Marianna: IN JANE THE VIRGIN
11/10/19, 12:22 AM - Marianna: OH MY GOSH
11/10/19, 12:22 AM - Marianna: HE DIED 2 SEASONS AGO
11/10/19, 12:36 AM - Marianna: Okay now I‚Äôm going to bed
11/10/19, 12:36 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôll find another album sometime tomorrow and send it to you
11/10/19, 12:36 AM - Marianna: But for now I‚Äôm gonna listen to z sides
11/10/19, 12:47 AM - Marianna: Goodnight goodnight
11/10/19, 2:35 AM - Marianna: Oh my gosh there is a lady outside and like honeslty a whole group that I would LOVE to not be there they are so loud
11/10/19, 8:33 AM - Caleb: Hey who doesn't love a big group of loud people outside their window at 2:30 am
11/10/19, 9:22 AM - Caleb: Woah fun fact apparently Sam and Grace are dating now
11/10/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: Awful idea: double date with Sam and Grace
11/10/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: That would be hilariously awkward
11/10/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: Update: why do people, when they use my camera, not zoom in at all
11/10/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: Why do they do that
11/10/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Just twist the ring like I said please
11/10/19, 10:30 AM - Marianna: Yeah this apartment is so loud it boggles my mind
11/10/19, 10:31 AM - Marianna: But while I‚Äôll say congrats to sam and grace I‚Äôm gonna veto the double date idea...
11/10/19, 10:31 AM - Marianna: And that is absolutely the worst!!!
11/10/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve tried to at least make sure some of my friends know how to do zoom on my camera
11/10/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: Because we use my camera for dance photos
11/10/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: But obviously I can‚Äôt take my own photos
11/10/19, 10:32 AM - Marianna: And good morning!
11/10/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: I'm heartbroken about the double date not working out but I'll live somehow
11/10/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: And I think they just don't get that it's not like a phone
11/10/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Optical zoom changes the picture, you can't just crop it and have it be the same resolution
11/10/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: But hey good morning!
11/10/19, 10:45 AM - Marianna: Did you feel the eye roll

11/10/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: That doesn't sound like a fair trade to me
11/10/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: And there's 0 chance that it survives Copenhagen even if I bring it back
11/10/19, 3:06 PM - Caleb: But hey I'll tell you what, if you want to bake with me next semester I'm down

11/10/19, 3:46 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll forget it
11/10/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: Update my mom was supposed to call at 3pm
11/10/19, 3:47 PM - Marianna: I have to go to church in 13 min
11/10/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not even worth calling at this point
11/10/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: I do not miss her time not management
11/10/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhh that's the worst
11/10/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: I hope she doesn't call you during mass
11/10/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: I feel like both my parents are quite good at time management
11/10/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: But my mom definitely more than my dad
11/10/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: Maybe I take that for granted
11/10/19, 3:55 PM - Caleb: Update I have secondary confirmation of back left for Vespers
11/10/19, 3:56 PM - Caleb: Wild how we never talked
11/10/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: No we talked for literally 8 minutes
11/10/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: My dad is good at it
11/10/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: My mom is awful at it
11/10/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: And then when I got to college, I realized how awful I feel when it‚Äôs my fault that I‚Äôm late but I‚Äôm in charge of myself so I‚Äôm rarely late
11/10/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôll occasionally be late to things
11/10/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs consistently late to things
11/10/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: We literally tell her we have to leave like 30 min at least before we really have to leave
11/10/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: But whatever
11/10/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm beginning to miss them man
11/10/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Also yeah it‚Äôs really strange
11/10/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Like so close so many times but never actually talked
11/10/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Besides zombies
11/10/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: You know
11/10/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: When we ‚Äúmet‚Äù _nudge nudge kink kink_
11/10/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: But good stuff
11/10/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the cake?
11/10/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Ah yes

11/10/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: That we started talking during
11/10/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: What a time
11/10/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Wouldn't say _kink kink_ but whatever floats your boat
11/10/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Didn't think it was that kinky but no shaming here
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Wink wink!
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Oh god
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Words

11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: WINK
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: How often do you type kink
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: uh it‚Äôs one letter off

11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: But you know my autocorrect
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: _suuuuuuuuuure_
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: I also definitely read it as wink wink
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Freudian slip?
11/10/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/10/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/10/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Ah Freudian slips
11/10/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: But I meant WINK WINK

11/10/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: You see you did a typo!
11/10/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre just very typo petiole

11/10/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Cake was great
11/10/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: I might go comatose on this train though
11/10/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: It also doesn't help that I put on music, and the first thing is "Asleep on a Train"
11/10/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for
11/10/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: To get you intellectually
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Even though I don‚Äôt know biology
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Hey you sleep on that train
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna be in church
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so dark outside and also in the church
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: I mean I'll take the CS and math stuff
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Hopefully _I_ won‚Äôt sleep
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: There's enough overlap there I'd say
11/10/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Okay that I can do
11/10/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: I _did_ pull out a creative orthogonal equations line on you yesterday
11/10/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: üòéüòé

11/10/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: Mass was good
11/10/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt been in sooooo long
11/10/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Eh, the train ride is a train ride
11/10/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Not particularly relaxing because I still have a bit of work
11/10/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: And my dad came with me
11/10/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: I think tomorrow and Wednesday he's going on trips out whole I try to do work though

11/10/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: And walking tour is probably happening Tuesday just because Wednesdays rarely have homework

11/10/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Okay I think i need to turn on do not disturb and turn off my brain
11/10/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
11/10/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah it helps when it's all within the same context
11/10/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: And I couldn't get it all instantly, but by the end I could work out almost everything
11/10/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: But also, let's be real services are so repetitive and the vocab is kinda limited
11/10/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Still fun though
11/10/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Anyway, goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow
11/10/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Update don‚Äôt like the album I sent. I‚Äôll try to find something else
11/11/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: Good morning
11/11/19, 7:10 AM - Marianna: I just realized iron and wine concert is tomorrow
11/11/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs the only Tuesday I‚Äôve planned a group project meeting all year
11/11/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: But I have to like be in like for the tickets no later than 6 if I really want to make sure I get one
11/11/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: Ah I hate group projects
11/11/19, 7:11 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôve realized how much work I have to do this week
11/11/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs a remarkably stressful way to wake up
11/11/19, 7:12 AM - Marianna: But good morning to you
11/11/19, 8:48 AM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm gonna for sure send an iron and wine album I‚Äôve been listening to their more mellow stuff and I love it
11/11/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: Is it another online queue or do you actually have to go somewhere?
11/11/19, 8:52 AM - Caleb: That sucks that it's so limited though, when's the concert?
11/11/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: We have to actually go somewhere
11/11/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: We could have bought tickets in advance
11/11/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: And okay! Sounds good, I like a lot of their stuff so I'm sure I'll be fine with it
11/11/19, 8:53 AM - Caleb: Wait is the concert tonight?
11/11/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: But the student tickets in the queue are _500 forints_
11/11/19, 8:53 AM - Marianna: Nope tomorrow night at 8
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: But we have to make sure we get them
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: So it limits project work time
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: Oh my lord why is everything so CHEAP
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: NOT FAIR
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: But ah yeah I missed that
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: Makes sense it's door admissions though
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Caleb: What's the project?
11/11/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: Well the normal tickets were like 3300-4500 but still why pay $10-15 when you can pay less than 2
11/11/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: Well
11/11/19, 8:55 AM - Caleb: That depends on how big the venue is
11/11/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: Yeah good point
11/11/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: But in my head I was thinking like what else do I do Tuesday nights
11/11/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Because usually nothing so waiting in line ISNT an issue
11/11/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: Idk how big the venue is
11/11/19, 8:56 AM - Marianna: But hey this is what I‚Äôm kind of stuck doing now because I bet tickets are gone for the normal tickets
11/11/19, 8:56 AM - Caleb: Yeah they're probably selling the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back seats
11/11/19, 8:57 AM - Caleb: But hey maybe you can sneak into standing room if there is any
11/11/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Luckily I don‚Äôt super care about SEEING the concert
11/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: CALEB I GOT PART 3 ASSESSMENT FOR AMAZON
11/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: I DIDNT MAKE IT THIS FAR LASTVEYAR
11/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: BUT NOW I HAVE TO DO A 2.5 HOUR LOGIC TEST BY FRIDAY
11/11/19, 10:00 AM - Marianna: I DONT HAVE TIME
11/11/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: TALK
11/11/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: TO
11/11/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: YOUR
11/11/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: PROFESSORS
11/11/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: They all work in the industry, they'll know that this is a big deal
11/11/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: Also CONGRATS!
11/11/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I hate doing that
11/11/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs more a me thing like if I allow myself to do that, Id be tempted to do it all the time
11/11/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: But it depends on how much I can get done in the next 2 days. I‚Äôm most worried about the theory deadline of Thursday morning
11/11/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: I may email him to see if I can email it to him sometime Thursday
11/11/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also like I could not go to yoga or this concert
11/11/19, 10:59 AM - Marianna: I still may skip yoga but I hate skipping yoga
11/11/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: CALEB MY BRAIN IS GOING A MILLIOJ MILES A SECOND ON LIKE SURPRISE STESS AND ADRENALINE
11/11/19, 11:06 AM - Marianna: WHOOOOO
11/11/19, 11:07 AM - Marianna: I am also incapable of focusing on class rn
11/11/19, 11:17 AM - Caleb: Eh I'd email him giving him a heads up honestly
11/11/19, 11:17 AM - Caleb: Then basically saying "hey I don't want you to think I'm slacking if I ask for an extension, and I'm not totally sure I'll need it, but _______"
11/11/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: Also oh geez are you doing alright?
11/11/19, 11:18 AM - Caleb: It almost sounds like it's fun for you üòÇ
11/11/19, 11:42 AM - Caleb: Okay I know your opinion on Lord of the Rings
11/11/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: But have you ever read The Chronicles of Narnia
11/11/19, 11:43 AM - Caleb: Or seen the movies
11/11/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just like DUDE I FeeL liKe I‚Äôm fULl oF kiNeTiC EnERgY
11/11/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: So no probably not doing great
11/11/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Add drop is in an hour
11/11/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Also
11/11/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Do you have to try to add drop things if you just got on the waitlist?
11/11/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Yeah I may see how much I get done today
11/11/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll probably end up emailing him
11/11/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: And yes!  Loved the world!  I read it as a kid and it‚Äôs totally not something I‚Äôd like now but it was so fun and magical back then
11/11/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Light posts/lampposts in snow always remind me of Narnia
11/11/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Did you read/watch?
11/11/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Also want to know something wonderful and nerdy
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Everyone in mobile always sends memes of our prof like seconds after he says something weird or funny in the main air group chat because like 3/4 of people are in this class but for the 15 or whatever who aren‚Äôt they must be soooo confused about what goes on during mobike
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Mobile
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Or mobile
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Mobile
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Now it autocorrects mobike to Mobile
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: What
11/11/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: It literally just did the opposite
11/11/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: What is the algorithm here
11/11/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah there's one open spot in Discreet
11/11/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: So I'm gonna (try to) add it and keep five classes until I figure out more what I'm doing
11/11/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah I have seen and read them!
11/11/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Okay it was actually books on tape
11/11/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I used to listen to them while just playing with my Lego
11/11/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Good times
11/11/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: But anyway, that's also hilarious about the mobike development class, I can't imagine having 3/4 of my program in a class
11/11/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: Like even in high school
11/11/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: That would be such a trainwreck
11/11/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: You deleted this message
11/11/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: Hey do you know why you never see elephants hiding in trees?
11/11/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: Well hey how are you
11/11/19, 1:09 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: hey what the FUCK DAVIDSON
11/11/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: I have a massive stress headache right now
11/11/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: I'm sitting in class with Kathryn and trying to focus at all
11/11/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: This isnt fun
11/11/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: I got the same thing
11/11/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Got through!
11/11/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Go to select term
11/11/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: And then add drop
11/11/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how I did it
11/11/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: I got through and GUESS WHAT FUCKING CLOSED SECTION
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: SOMEONE, IN THE 22 MINUTES IT TOOK FOR T&I TO GET THEIR SHIT TOGETHER, BEAT ME TO IT
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: WOW
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: THANKS GUY
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Discrete?
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: yep
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: You can definitely petition
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I feel sick
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Or just keep watching it
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Hey
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: I hate this so much
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not the end of the world
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs such an aweful Austen
11/11/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: System
11/11/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/11/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: Yeah it is
11/11/19, 1:26 PM - Caleb: And I didnt even get to finish my joke
11/11/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: What was your joke?
11/11/19, 1:27 PM - Caleb: Because they're really good at it
11/11/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/11/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: I missed that sorry I‚Äôm gonna have to go reread some texts
11/11/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: I got lost in the flurry
11/11/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Update sarah has 3 clases!
11/11/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Hey Caleb
11/11/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt let stupid banner web ruin your Monday
11/11/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: How would Thomas Cameron feel if I just showed up to his class anyway and said "I'll attend class and do the homeworks so you might as well add me"
11/11/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Eh you might be better going to him office and being like hello I need this class and am very interested please let me join
11/11/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: The class says it‚Äôs only 20 people
11/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: And the math cs dept has a pretty good ceiling exemption form that lets most people in
11/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: But wow!  We have more movie overlap!
11/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: And I like the elephant joke
11/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôll have to look extra hard next time
11/11/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Just to thwart their genius
11/11/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: You're cruel
11/11/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: My jokes are awful and you know you love them
11/11/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Also is it against the honor code to plan a revolution against T&I
11/11/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: As long as I don't lie or cheat about it
11/11/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: It'll be an honest coup
11/11/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: I read coup like it rhymes with soup
11/11/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 2:56 PM - Caleb: It's back when we first adopted Charlie
11/11/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Oh and I went to a roast beef place and the guy gave me fries on the house
11/11/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Life isn't so bad is it
11/11/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: OH WHAT A SMALL PUPPY
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Oh and Charlie‚Äôs so little too!
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: And hey
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: You eat those fries
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Remember
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Treat yo self
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Done class!
11/11/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Ready to homework homework homework
11/11/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: I'm about to start my next class
11/11/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: It'll be long because I still have a splitting headache
11/11/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: Not a great day
11/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: Oh good
11/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: I like my sense of humor
11/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: People with my sense of humor are good people
11/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: In my honest and completely unbiased opinion
11/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: Hey hey you got this
11/11/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: So close to being done
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Take Advil afterwards
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: And he y
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: DRINK WATER
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: üòù
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: Did
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: You
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: Just
11/11/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: No
11/11/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: I did not
11/11/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre hallucinating
11/11/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: You _really_ need to drink some water
11/11/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Darn I was just going to say I'm so proud
11/11/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Oh man I feel like garbage
11/11/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: This is going to be a long long class
11/11/19, 4:33 PM - Marianna: Hey you GOT this
11/11/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Hey random ass question and I swear I'm not trying to get to Budapest
11/11/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: I found a dirt cheap flight to Milan
11/11/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Overnight layover in Budapest
11/11/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: Could I crash at your place if I end up going with this flight
11/11/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Why are you going to Milan in the middle of the week?
11/11/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: I have a break coming up
11/11/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: It's the 20th-24th
11/11/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: And I have made exactly 0 plans
11/11/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: So I'm scrambling for cheap flights
11/11/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: I mean I‚Äôm not by any means gonna say no
11/11/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: Wait let me actually see if I have anything that week
11/11/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: This is in early pre-planning by the way
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah I get that
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: That sounds like a hellish way to get to Milan from Copenhagen
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôd work for me
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: But it's c h e a p
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: It's the cheapest international flight
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: And takes like 20 hours
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: Besides Poland
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: And Bulgaria
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Bulgaria?
11/11/19, 4:39 PM - Caleb: And France
11/11/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even know where that is
11/11/19, 4:40 PM - Caleb: They all have stupidly long layovers too
11/11/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: What about Paris?  Have you figured out seeing lee?
11/11/19, 4:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah it fell through
11/11/19, 4:43 PM - Caleb: Was supposed to be next weekend
11/11/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Oh no
11/11/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/11/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Could you do that for break?
11/11/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing with Woo and Derek
11/11/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs fair
11/11/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: Have you all traveled together?
11/11/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not entirely sure we could host them in our apt if they wanted to go to Milan. We do have the floor mattress pads robin and Devansh and Mia all slept on we could set up in the kitchen but I‚Äôd actually have to check with sarah on that one
11/11/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: We haven't actually
11/11/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: And don't worry, I wasn't suggesting that they also sleep at your place
11/11/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: They can get a hostel
11/11/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Also this is still super super not confirmed it'll happen
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: I just noticed one of the cheapest international flights went though Budapest and it might be worth mentioning
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Hey he
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: I get that
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: I probably shouldn't have said anything honestly
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: I promise not to get my hopes up
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll see ya in <3 weeks anyway
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Haha
11/11/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: An honest use of <3
11/11/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: I crack myself up
11/11/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Also I hate theory
11/11/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Aw
11/11/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
11/11/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: But also if it did happen, it would literally be to sleep
11/11/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Youve got class and I fly out early afternoon
11/11/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Yeah my wednesdays are not as fun as your wednesdays
11/11/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: If it works out it works but if not I won‚Äôt be upset
11/11/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm still at school
11/11/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna go to yoga at 8 though
11/11/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Because I think it will make me feel better and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna be productive during that time anyway
11/11/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Well I guess I could be
11/11/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Ah
11/11/19, 5:30 PM - Marianna: Should I go?
11/11/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Well if you could be productive I'd say yes
11/11/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: But if that's not happening, yoga it up
11/11/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Also the other place were looking at is Amsterdam and some places around it
11/11/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Which also sounds fun as hell
11/11/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never actually stayed in Milan (although I am going this weekend) but you know I LOVED amsterdam (and you‚Äôve also been there and probably for longer so idk if it‚Äôs relevant) so I‚Äôd say amsterdam is a safe bet at it being a really great break too
11/11/19, 5:41 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôll be so good for you to travel with them
11/11/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: Like make some good MEMS from abroad but this time, in a different country with your cope buds!
11/11/19, 5:42 PM - Marianna: I think I need yoga I just hate how long it takes to get there and do yoga and come back home like it‚Äôs 2+ hours of my day
11/11/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: But maybe I could be productive when I get home for a bit
11/11/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: But also maybe not
11/11/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see
11/11/19, 6:11 PM - Marianna: Okay finally on le bus going home
11/11/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: ALSO CALEB IVE BEEN TOLD THERE IS A CHOCOLATE MUSEUM IN BRUSSELS AND I AM GOING TO REQUEST WE MAKE A STOP THERE
11/11/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think we can swing the chocolate museum üòÅ
11/11/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: Im debating if bruges would actually work
11/11/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: Because that's a full day ordeal
11/11/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: And while it's fantastic, there's more to do in Brussels
11/11/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: So we might just want to stick around Brussels for the weekend
11/11/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: Yeah I was thinking about that too and I kind of think staying in Brussels might be a good game plan
11/11/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: Idk I haven‚Äôt really looked into anything there yet
11/11/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
11/11/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Good!
11/11/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôve calmed down a bunch from this morning
11/11/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: But I got all my classes
11/11/19, 6:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm still super stressed but the day itself hasn‚Äôt been bad
11/11/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/11/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: I think webtree is what kicked off my day going wrong
11/11/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: I blame T&I and also my own dumb ass for missing a possibility with webtree
11/11/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: ... The lights just shut off in the lounge I'm hanging out in
11/11/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: I should probabaly go shouldn't I
11/11/19, 6:47 PM - Caleb: But I'm glad you had a good day!
11/11/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Uh what lounge were you in?
11/11/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Is there a reason the lights went out?
11/11/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm watching ted talks to get info for my comp bio paper
11/11/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: It was just the lounge for DIS
11/11/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: What's the paper?
11/11/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Criticisms of synthetic biology
11/11/19, 7:21 PM - Marianna: Low key may talk about dystopian novels at some point
11/11/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm very excited for it but it‚Äôs like 10 pages and not even double spaced
11/11/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see how it goes
11/11/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also due the Saturday we‚Äôre in Brussels so it has to be done by that Friday which honestly isn‚Äôt too much shorter. It‚Äôs when things are due Monday which really means Friday that gets stressful
11/11/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Talk about Gattaca
11/11/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Quality movie
11/11/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: And ahhhh that's the worst
11/11/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: The extra time is nice, but not if you have things to do
11/11/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: I do love gattaca
11/11/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: We really have the weirdest movie in common
11/11/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Also
11/11/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Had like the best yoga practice in a long time
11/11/19, 10:00 PM - Marianna: Got remarkably far in my split
11/11/19, 10:01 PM - Marianna: Not by any means close to a real thing but closer you know
11/11/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs an album for you‚Ä¶ The Creek Drank The Cradle by Iron & Wine
https://open.spotify.com/album/1nDf4JHP7Z4HfecGdrtv1O?si=cneVu12nSvyP1jnm0uRSHg
11/11/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs try this
11/11/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: I also have one picked out for the next time I get to choose
11/11/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Hey perfect, I can't wait
11/11/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Also, I realized that I'm not totally sure what you had in mind when you came up with the album-of-the-week thing
11/11/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Did you want us to start it at the same time and listen when we're chatting, or were you hoping more for what we've been doing
11/11/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: And ahaa I have one too
11/11/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: It's Icelandic actually
11/11/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: I think you'll like it
11/11/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: It's a classic
11/11/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: And OH geez, fun fact, I used to be able to do a full split
11/11/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: I'm actually still pretty flexible
11/11/19, 10:20 PM - Marianna: I mean either or
11/11/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: I realized we both end up texting in bed a lot so why not
11/11/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: But not exactly like WE MUST START AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AND LISTEN TO IT TOGETHER vives
11/11/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Vibes
11/11/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: AND NO WAY
11/11/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: there has to be photographic evidence for this
11/11/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: I have never been as close as I am now. That‚Äôs my next project after I can do a full forward fold
11/11/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Yep üòÅ
11/11/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: I used to be able to do a full straddle, and almost a full split
11/11/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Haven't tried in a couple years though
11/11/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Brb
11/11/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Update: OUCH
11/11/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Split isn't happening, but I can still kick well above my head
11/11/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Also I've consulted the oracle for any pictures
11/11/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: You say oracle and I think crypto
11/11/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: And oooh I‚Äôm sorry
11/11/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: I say oracle and I think updates
11/11/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: And then the Greek stuff
11/11/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I sorry about the split though
11/11/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Ooooh greek stuff
11/11/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Were you a Percy Jackson fan?
11/11/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 10:39 PM - Caleb: I know it exists though
11/11/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: And nope, can't say I was
11/11/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: I don't think I knew about it until the fad was over
11/11/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Also this essay is going surprisingly well
11/11/19, 10:45 PM - Caleb: I'm using block quotes, and I always feel cool when using block quotes
11/11/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Bummer
11/11/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Then I don‚Äôt believe it
11/11/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/11/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Boot
11/11/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: IT
11/11/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: I wasn‚Äôt in the Percy Jackson phase either
11/11/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: I read and watch it after the craze about it
11/11/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt love them
11/11/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Well I did LOVE the chapter titles in the book
11/11/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Very witty
11/11/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: And yay congrats!!!
11/11/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: I hate block quotes because I never remember the rules for the format of them and how to cite them looks ugly to me I think idk I just don‚Äôt love them
11/11/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Eh I've honestly stopped worrying about formatting style
11/11/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: I think latex did it to me
11/11/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: In no situation ever will your work have to fit a certain exact constraint for how things should look
11/11/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Either it's scientific writing, and your editor takes care of it
11/11/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Or it's other types of writing and you have some creative license as long as it looks nice
11/11/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: Conventions are for schmucks
11/11/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Welp, laptop battery died and I don't feel like charging it
11/11/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Guess that means I'm done for the night
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna latex my compbio paper
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Partially because I can
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: And then I can add diagrams or formulas if I come across any
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Big flex over here
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Did not mean it that‚Äôs ya
11/11/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Way
11/11/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/11/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: It's just the way it be
11/11/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: I think it's possible to make a nice looking paper in word or docs
11/11/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: It's just a little masochistic
11/11/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: I do too
11/11/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Sarahs like latexing all her cover letters and resumes
11/11/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm like nah bruh
11/11/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Would you be down for phone call in 10?
11/11/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/11/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Was just about to ask
11/11/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah that works with me
11/11/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: I think I'm in a comfy place for my paper tonight, and my class tomorrow morning is sort of a work period
11/11/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Okay as long as you‚Äôre sure your good
11/11/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Let me go apply to something real quick and then I‚Äôll be ready
11/11/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Update my friends are now talking about Patrick and chocolates
11/11/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Oh no
11/11/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Have they heard the full story
11/11/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Like the one I told you
11/11/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Well
11/11/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: They knew that he said "I gave you chocolates, now you give me a blowjob"
11/11/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: And some were on the fence about it actually happening
11/11/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: But that's about it
11/11/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Basically pat sent me and Louis a video of a box of chocolates, and inside was a bag of weed
11/11/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Also pat has evolved into peak stonerbro, so that's wonderful to know
11/11/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: But anyway
11/11/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Lee sent
11/11/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: "ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äi did not get the video which means that i am not a close friend of patrickü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä"
11/11/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm ready to call when you are
11/11/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Carl sends, "hey I didn't get it either, but ya know chocolates have a certain connotation for pat"
11/12/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: This message was deleted
11/12/19, 12:36 AM - Caleb: NOOOOO
11/12/19, 12:36 AM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt want to see that cursed image anymore

11/12/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: I hate weird photos of me
11/12/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: Like cute weird ones like me with salsa on my head are fine
11/12/19, 12:38 AM - Marianna: But that one is not

11/12/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: I hit my head and the only thing in marions fridge was salsa so I used that as an ice pack
11/12/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: Aw shucks
11/12/19, 12:42 AM - Marianna: Wanna see me with a photo shoot of mini pumpkins at Nummit

11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: I want cozy puppy photos
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: But like with me and puppies
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: How do I find puppies
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: Is there an app for single puppies who need cozy in my area?
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: Okay
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: I need to sleep
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: You need to sleep
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Marianna: Good sleep
11/12/19, 12:45 AM - Caleb: Denise's
11/12/19, 12:46 AM - Caleb: Offer still out there if you're ever in the area
11/12/19, 12:46 AM - Caleb: And from my impression that's just tinder
11/12/19, 12:46 AM - Caleb: So many dog pics
11/12/19, 12:46 AM - Caleb: So so many
11/12/19, 12:46 AM - Caleb: But honestly I'm debating volunteering at a shelter next semester if my schedule doesn't kill me
11/12/19, 12:47 AM - Caleb: Anyway
11/12/19, 12:47 AM - Caleb: Goodnight! Thanks for talking
11/12/19, 7:41 AM - Caleb: You ever wake up, and your bed is so so cozy, but you need to get up and reality sets in that it's going to be a loooooooooooong day?
11/12/19, 7:41 AM - Caleb: That was this morning
11/12/19, 7:41 AM - Caleb: Good morning
11/12/19, 9:04 AM - Marianna: I will make it to Denise‚Äôs at some point
11/12/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a life goal now
11/12/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: Yeah I thought about that for warner service hours but I‚Äôm pretty sure they wouldn‚Äôt let me because it‚Äôs not quite the service they want us doing for like credit
11/12/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôll probably do an hour at the preschool every week if I can make that work
11/12/19, 9:06 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs more hours than I would need but hey why not
11/12/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôve woken up like 5 times since 5:30am because of noise or just my body thinking we wake up early
11/12/19, 9:07 AM - Marianna: But good morning to you too!
11/12/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: Good morning! Yeah Denise's is basically a mecca for dog lovers
11/12/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: And is this the preschool at DCPC? Jenn was doing that last year and I wanted to do that, but my schedule was too packed
11/12/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: There's also a program where you get a reading buddy at the local elementary school and I REALLY want to do that
11/12/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: I probably will actually, ny schedule is stacked MWF, so Tuesdays and Thursdays are almost totally free
11/12/19, 9:10 AM - Marianna: Yeah!  I worked with the squirrel class last year Twas a good time
11/12/19, 9:10 AM - Marianna: Nothing like playing go fish super sleep deprived on a Thursday morning man
11/12/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: With like 4 year olds
11/12/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: It was a great time
11/12/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: I also got them to count to 100 for the first time as a class
11/12/19, 9:11 AM - Marianna: So I was teaching numbers which is probably the thing I‚Äôm most qualified to do
11/12/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Haaaaaaaaa
11/12/19, 9:12 AM - Marianna: What does your schedule look like so far?
11/12/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: My schedule looks unkind so far
11/12/19, 9:12 AM - Caleb: Hang on
11/12/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/12/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: Change mat140 to 1:30-2:20 Discreet if things work out
11/12/19, 9:13 AM - Marianna: üò≥
11/12/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs four hours of class in a row
11/12/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: Although admittedly that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing this semester
11/12/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: Although you need to eat my man
11/12/19, 9:14 AM - Marianna: I did class 11:30-2:30 last semester and had lunch everyday at 10:45
11/12/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: But honestly lunch at 2:30 doesnt  sound awful as long as you get breakfast
11/12/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: I just couldn‚Äôt do that because warner food would potentially be gone
11/12/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: But lots of Union for you
11/12/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: And you‚Äôll love
11/12/19, 9:15 AM - Marianna: Live

11/12/19, 9:23 AM - Marianna: But I like having 3-1
11/12/19, 9:24 AM - Marianna: And really I think if you do the ceiling exemption thing for Cameron, he‚Äôll let you join discrete
11/12/19, 9:25 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs not big into saying no I‚Äôve found
11/12/19, 9:25 AM - Marianna: Caleb my bed is so warm do I really have to get up
11/12/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: Woah you're taking psych 101?
11/12/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: I need to do that eventually
11/12/19, 9:30 AM - Caleb: Probably senior year
11/12/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: And I like having 3-1 too
11/12/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: Last semester was absolutely brutal though
11/12/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: It was 3-2 with two labs
11/12/19, 9:31 AM - Caleb: I'm super glad I'm not doing that again
11/12/19, 9:32 AM - Caleb: Given one of them was as an AT, but I needed to attend all the classes and make my own study guides and assignments for them
11/12/19, 9:33 AM - Marianna: Oh my gosh that literally sounds killer
11/12/19, 9:33 AM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt realize your last semester was that bad
11/12/19, 9:34 AM - Marianna: And yeah!  I really want to be able to take the attention and perception psy class because that‚Äôs my dads field and so we‚Äôve done a lot of things with it and like how senses work and stuff is absolutely so cool
11/12/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs the most bio part of psy honestly because there are neurons involved and not just chemicals and hormones
11/12/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: In my opinion
11/12/19, 9:35 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôd do that class senior spring if I can get it
11/12/19, 9:35 AM - Caleb: Ah man
11/12/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: That sounds super interesting
11/12/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: Oh the classes I'd take if, you know, I didn't need to graduate on time
11/12/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: And honestly it wasn't that bad
11/12/19, 9:36 AM - Caleb: I didn't have a whole lot of free time and my friends worried about me a good bit, but it was one of my best semesters
11/12/19, 9:37 AM - Caleb: I was also doing orchestra and a chamber group and leading club projects on top of it
11/12/19, 9:38 AM - Caleb: Got some reason the tighter my schedule is, the better I am with getting things done and staying on track
11/12/19, 9:38 AM - Caleb: Idk, it's kind of weird and hard to explain
11/12/19, 9:38 AM - Caleb: Oh and pep band! The all important pep band, how could I forget
11/12/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: And rlo duties too
11/12/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm amazed you found time for our like 3 dates
11/12/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: And yeah there are a ton of things I‚Äôd date if I didn‚Äôt have to graduate on time or care about my gpa
11/12/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôd probably try a cool English class but I‚Äôm don‚Äôt enjoy the work which means I don‚Äôt put effort into the work so it‚Äôs like a negative loop
11/12/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: I work very well with deadlines
11/12/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs when deadlines aren‚Äôt around that it gets rough for me
11/12/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: And even me imposing deadlines isn‚Äôt great
11/12/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: Oh yeah I also had 2 mandatory Chinese AT classes every week on top of that
11/12/19, 9:56 AM - Caleb: I'm honestly amazed I found time for it too
11/12/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: I'm more just amazed I survived
11/12/19, 10:01 AM - Marianna: Yeah wow
11/12/19, 10:02 AM - Marianna: Okay this is stressing me out idk how anyone can fit all that into a semester
11/12/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: But hey if you did that I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs safe to say you‚Äôll never have that much stuff in a single semester again
11/12/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: Knock on wood
11/12/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: I GOT A VANGUARD PHONE INTERVIEW
11/12/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: yes another thing for me to do this week
11/12/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: But AHHHH
11/12/19, 10:31 AM - Marianna: Oh and also idk how this is gonna work like is me having an international number gonna be an issue?  I don‚Äôt even know how actual calling on my phone works
11/12/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Pop in your US sim, download Google voice and register a number, use wifi calling
11/12/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: But HEY YOU CONGRATS
11/12/19, 11:07 AM - Caleb: Vanguard looks great but hey thats my PA bias
11/12/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Will that actually work
11/12/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Yeah it's what I do when I call my bank at home
11/12/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Also Hans got the next step of amazon too and he got all the test cases and it makes me feel like crap
11/12/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: But hey who knows where I‚Äôll end up now
11/12/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Agghh I'm sorry
11/12/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: And oooh but can people call you like they would a normal number?
11/12/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Thats not fair, you're better than him
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Yeah it basically serves as a virtual dual sim
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: But wifi linked
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: I okay I should have used python I just didn‚Äôt realize I could
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Yeah but YA GOT IT SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Heyoooo
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Because last year I did java because that was more recent for me and then the debugging was only java so in my head I thought it was all only java
11/12/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Yeah well I still might be scored lower because I got less test cases
11/12/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: But I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm a better person which sucks but I don‚Äôt talk about cheating all the time soooooo
11/12/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I also don‚Äôt know if he didn‚Äôt cheat for the test
11/12/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: But he also is smart so maybe he didbr
11/12/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt
11/12/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Yeah
11/12/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: But the thing is that we don't know if he did or didn't
11/12/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Kinda ruined his integrity there
11/12/19, 11:58 AM - Marianna: Yeah
11/12/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Also I'm now on an Icelandic binge, and I found an old song that I used to love and I got chills
11/12/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: But still makes me feel crappy
11/12/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Because he‚Äôs gonna get it and I‚Äôm not if only one of us gets it
11/12/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I was confused what Icelandic binge meant for a minute
11/12/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Hey my head hurts I‚Äôm getting stressed again
11/12/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: OH SHIT late for a meeting
11/12/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: I kind of just want to watch ted talks and get in bed
11/12/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: But the day is so far from over
11/12/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: And oh no!  What meeting?
11/12/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Professor and Kathryn
11/12/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Class rep stuff
11/12/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: Biggest mood I've heard all day
11/12/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/55gISxV37mffOW2DbSskT3?si=D4LIkNwBRNm4MGx01Y4DxQ
11/12/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Oh did you still make it in time to at least make an appearance?
11/12/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: And yeah
11/12/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Idk why but it‚Äôs a mood
11/12/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been
11/12/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah I was 3 minutes late
11/12/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Perks of being in the middle of the city hahaha
11/12/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: My days been alright
11/12/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: I took Sudafed and I feel odd now
11/12/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: I'm a bit stressed about Thursday and Friday still
11/12/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And I remembered Spyros wants the journal publication finished by the end of November so now I'm HELLA stressed about that
11/12/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And I promised my dad to show him some Kierkegaard buildings after class, so I'll probably end it at the black diamond and just do work there
11/12/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs not to shabby
11/12/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Sorry that was only about the first thing
11/12/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: The rest is a little shabby
11/12/19, 3:18 PM - Marianna: But you got this
11/12/19, 3:19 PM - Marianna: Sorry I‚Äôve been in my group project all afternoon
11/12/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/12/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: PUPDATE
11/12/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: good stuff
11/12/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: Made my day better thank you
11/12/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: And it's no worry! You're busy tonight
11/12/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Still think you're going to make it to the concert?
11/12/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/12/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: It's a little corner where we hang coats next to the door
11/12/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Apparently he's claimed it
11/12/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Yes!
11/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Still managed to get Chinese food
11/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Now heading to stand in line in the rain
11/12/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see how much I overestimated how early we have to get there to make sure we get tickets
11/12/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs adorable
11/12/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Did he move his own doggie bed there
11/12/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Or was it put there for him
11/12/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: He usually pulls a coat down and snuggles with it
11/12/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: But I guess my mom just put a bed there and made it official
11/12/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: And good luck! I'm expecting at least a few concert snaps if you get in üòÅ
11/12/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: Ahhhh man
11/12/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: Apparently Josh and his girlfriend are visiting PA January 8th
11/12/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: I'll be gone for orchestra tour
11/12/19, 5:45 PM - Caleb: That's just unfortunate
11/12/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Aw that is soooo precious
11/12/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: Well we made it
11/12/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: And guess what
11/12/19, 5:50 PM - Marianna: We won‚Äôt be waiting in the rain tonight
11/12/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: Because they let us eat our dinner inside at a table just right next to the ticket office so we‚Äôll be good
11/12/19, 5:51 PM - Marianna: Oh NOOO I‚Äôm sorry that sucks
11/12/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: What are the odds
11/12/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: Heyyyyyy that's awesome! Have a good time
11/12/19, 5:54 PM - Caleb: When's the concert start?
11/12/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: And yeah, it does suck
11/12/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: I haven't seen him in like a year
11/12/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: GAH it's fine though
11/12/19, 5:55 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll go to California sometime and see him and my aunt and uncle
11/12/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: 8pm
11/12/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: We can get tickets and hopefully go in at 7pm
11/12/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: Not too shabby
11/12/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: And aw I‚Äôm sorry
11/12/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt image not seeing my brother
11/12/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: Like this is the longest I‚Äôve gone and I don‚Äôt always interact with him a ton when we are in the same state
11/12/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: But growing up and moving away is gonna make that weird I think
11/12/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: And I think that‚Äôs normal
11/12/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: But california is fun is full send recommending going
11/12/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/12/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: It's been a hot second
11/12/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: And ha, yeah and he's now at your school
11/12/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Honestly I love that you and your brother are so close
11/12/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: It's really sweet to see
11/12/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: Okay we may not be that close
11/12/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: We have our moments
11/12/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: But we also have our NOT moments
11/12/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: I think you mostly just hear the good ones
11/12/19, 6:30 PM - Marianna: I think
11/12/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm really hoping we‚Äôll be good on campus together
11/12/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: You don't think you and your brother are close?
11/12/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: And idk, I hear lots of Joey's dumbass shenanigans, I'm not sure if those count as the good ones
11/12/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: How's his hand by the way?
11/12/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/12/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Like I said
11/12/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: We have our moments
11/12/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay but I heard how bad it was after talking with my mom
11/12/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: He punctured an artery
11/12/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Had blood literally spurting in bursts out of his hand
11/12/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Not to be gr√°ficos
11/12/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: But this kid literally didn‚Äôt even go straight to the hospital
11/12/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: He went to his hall counselor, the health center, and then called 2 friends before one could take him to the hospital
11/12/19, 6:38 PM - Marianna: My mom told him to just call the gosh darn ambulance next time he has blood spurting
11/12/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: JOEY
11/12/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: WHAT THE HELL HE PUNCTURED AN ARTERY
11/12/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: JOEY
11/12/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: THAT'S HOW YOU DIE
11/12/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: WHAT
11/12/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Well did the hall counselor do a good job of stopping the bleeding?
11/12/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: I gotta know more
11/12/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: This story keeps getting better
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs what judy said
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: And idk
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: He didn‚Äôt die
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: So there‚Äôs that
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know more
11/12/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: You can ask him about it when you see him I guess
11/12/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: No offense to Joey
11/12/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: But he sounds like an absolute pain in the ass as a resident
11/12/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah
11/12/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Hall counselors are severely underpaid to deal with his artery-severing ass
11/12/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: Remind me to tell you about ‚Äúeleven seven‚Äù next time I talk to you or maybe just when I see you
11/12/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Oh god
11/12/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: I mean if one of my residents came to me literally dying, I'd definitely help out
11/12/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: But also that isn't every hall counselors ability
11/12/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: They are NOT prepared to deal with that
11/12/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Why are college kids such dumbasses
11/12/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Why are boys such dumbasses
11/12/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: Sadly Joey is both a college kid
11/12/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: And a dumbass
11/12/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: So he‚Äôs a nightmare probably yeah
11/12/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
11/12/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: I'm a college kid and a dumbass
11/12/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: I hope I was never that wild
11/12/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: Well you did dye your hair with bleach
11/12/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: So a different kind of wild freshman year maybe
11/12/19, 6:53 PM - Caleb: _hi you're now blocked_
11/12/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: Noooooo
11/12/19, 6:53 PM - Marianna: You caaaaaant
11/12/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Jk want a picture of the bleached goodness
11/12/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: I'm not ashamed of my past
11/12/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Well a little bit but I can get over it
11/12/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/12/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: GOT TICKETS!
11/12/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Hey it happens
11/12/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre still doing great sweetie
11/12/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: Gee thanks
11/12/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: Glad my dark past isn't keeping you away
11/12/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: No it‚Äôs not
11/12/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: Plus the bleached hair is a LIGHT part of your past
11/12/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: Duh
11/12/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: Also
11/12/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: SECOND ROW
11/12/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: OUR SEATS ARE SECOND ROW
11/12/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: wHAT
11/12/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Hey you know how I said the thing the other day about the tickets and being able to even see them
11/12/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: I take that back
11/12/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Good jorb
11/12/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: If you get a selfie with Sam you'll officially be the coolest cat
11/12/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: A wild cat, some might say
11/12/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: Shout something along the lines of "WANNA HANG OUT AT FIVE POINTS LATER" and he'll 100% notice you
11/12/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Just mention Five Points or Cola or something
11/12/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: It was a good freaking jorb
11/12/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm happy
11/12/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Idk if I‚Äôll do any of that
11/12/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: But I certainly will have SOOO much fun
11/12/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm pumped
11/12/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Oh guess what
11/12/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: What what what
11/12/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Also I'm seriously not kidding, if you mention Five points I guarantee you can get him to say say something to you
11/12/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: He used to hang out/grew up near Columbia SC
11/12/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: And Five Points is famous for being where college students/high schoolers/middle schoolers just blow time
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: Taylor swift just sang to the entire concert hall
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: From my phone
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: :)
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: AHAHAHAHA
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Just like old times
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Probably wasn't as quiet though
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm just gonna let him do his art
11/12/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah but part of the fun of live concerts is interacting with the person
11/12/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Its the energy, its the personality that makes concerts fun
11/12/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Otherwise, just go listen to an album
11/12/19, 8:04 PM - Marianna: But this concert isn‚Äôt like a hoot and holler concert
11/12/19, 8:04 PM - Marianna: There are like seats
11/12/19, 8:04 PM - Marianna: And old people
11/12/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: Ahhaaaaahhh
11/12/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: Makes sense
11/12/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs says no photos or videos
11/12/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Well have fun!
11/12/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: So you may get stuff
11/12/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: Depends
11/12/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Don't break rules and get thrown out
11/12/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: But a sneak shot would be hella cool
11/12/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: OKAY UPDATE the five points thing will definitely work if you get a chance to mention it or need his attention
11/12/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: He used to be a waiter at a restaurant in five points
11/12/19, 9:55 PM - Marianna: See my story
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Pretty concert hall
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Shouting would have been out of place
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: They didn‚Äôt play my song
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: They played mostly Calexico songs
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Which is who their new album is out with I think
11/12/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: Good stuff still just didn‚Äôt know much of it
11/12/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: Update we got on the wrong team going home
11/12/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: But now we‚Äôre kind of stuck with it
11/12/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Well
11/12/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I've had a blast of a night working on an essay, front row seats
11/12/19, 9:58 PM - Caleb: So who's the real winner üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/12/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Hey I'm not feeling grewr so I think I'm gonna just put on the album and head to bed early
11/12/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you had a fun night, let me know when you get home and I'll talk to you tomorrow!
11/12/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Oooh OOOH look at you go
11/12/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre not feeling grewr
11/12/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Although feeling grewr sounds worse than not feeling great
11/12/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm still sorry about it
11/12/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Got an admissions interview slot!
11/12/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: And my vanguard is on Monday so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it this week!
11/12/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Good stuff
11/12/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Now I have to do crypto but I support your sleep
11/12/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Goodnight!
11/12/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Update because I'm a filthy liar and had to leave my room to brush my teeth
11/12/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I think Hanne and I are good ahaon
11/12/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Again*
11/12/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I'm still unhappy with the whole situation, and unhappy I was able to defend myself from what I thought was unfair
11/12/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: But we were just hanging out in the kitchen and chatting a little bit, and all seemed well
11/12/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: We talked about camping and scouts and psychology and death, but it just felt kinda good
11/12/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Anyway, goodnight!
11/12/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs right a FILTHY liar (get it because you almost forgot to brush your teeth)
11/12/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: And hey
11/12/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Good is good
11/12/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Camping and scouts and psychology and death sounds like something you don‚Äôt talk about with someone you‚Äôre not good with
11/12/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: So I agree
11/12/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs not perfect but remember only another month and then you‚Äôll have pups and parents as roommates
11/12/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: And then maybe me as a roommate
11/12/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: (Kidding Kidding don‚Äôt want to impose)
11/12/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Do the pups sleep in pup beds?  Or with your mom?  Or do you pup snuggles in bed sometimes?
11/12/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Well now I‚Äôm in bed
11/12/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Without any pups
11/12/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Or any yous
11/12/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve got a pig
11/12/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: And music
11/12/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs good. Goodnight!
11/13/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Update the morning is off to an aweful start
11/13/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: I snoozed or slept through all alarms
11/13/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: So now I‚Äôm running so late
11/13/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: And I feel like crap and just want to sleep but the end is so not in sight
11/13/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: In hindsight probably shouldn‚Äôt have gone to the concert
11/13/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: So I also feel massively like anything that doesn‚Äôt work out is gonna be on me this week because I should have prioritized school
11/13/19, 8:15 AM - Marianna: Ugh
11/13/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: Hey
11/13/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: You
11/13/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: It's okay
11/13/19, 8:21 AM - Caleb: Look at the grand scheme of things, it's okay to be a little late once in a semester
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: Your professors know who you are and know that you're a good student
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôve already been late to this class
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: But I actually I‚Äôll make it today fine
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just grumpy about having to go in general
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: Years from now, are you going to remember the $2 Iron and Wine concert, or a stressful week
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhaa
11/13/19, 8:22 AM - Caleb: Yeah me too man
11/13/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: I've got two field studies back to back today
11/13/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: And I just want to sleep
11/13/19, 8:23 AM - Caleb: And my dad is still in town, but I need to study for a test and write an essay
11/13/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: True
11/13/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry about the field studies
11/13/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: Are they at least interesting?
11/13/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: And didn‚Äôt you have two back to back last week?
11/13/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: And yeah I think the semester is just ramping up or catching up to us or something
11/13/19, 8:35 AM - Marianna: Everyone is feeling that this week is brutal
11/13/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Well maybe not marion she never seems to feel that and I haven‚Äôt talked with her about it
11/13/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôll see her this weekend!
11/13/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: Well I'm gonna find out if they're interesting
11/13/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: I'll be honest, first one probabaly no
11/13/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: Second one, yeah maybe
11/13/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: Also re: the dogs
11/13/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: Sometimes they'll sleep in bed with my parents
11/13/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: And if they do that, they'll crawl under the covers
11/13/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: But usually they'll sleep in a crate
11/13/19, 9:41 AM - Caleb: They have their own, but they have a comfy bed and pile on each other in one of them
11/13/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: What are the field studies today?
11/13/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: And aw
11/13/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: Puppy brothers love each other
11/13/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: Good puppy brothers
11/13/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm so tired
11/13/19, 9:55 AM - Marianna: I did get 7 hrs of sleep thanks to sleeping in but arg it isn‚Äôt enough apparently
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - Caleb: Line from my professor:
11/13/19, 9:58 AM - Caleb: "this is the last stop of the bus, so make sure you take everything with you: bags, hats, water bottles, childhood trauma, take it all"
11/13/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Good
11/13/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Honestly wait why wouldn‚Äôt you want to leave the childhood trauma on the bus
11/13/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: That seems like a cheap and dirty way to get rid of it
11/13/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Cheaper than therapy!
11/13/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Or alcohol!
11/13/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: It's also funny because it's a field trip to his home town
11/13/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Idk a bus ride in Copenhagen might be more expensive than a bottle of wine in Budapest
11/13/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Wait even a bottle of wine in Budapest is cheaper than a bus ride in Budapest which is 475ft
11/13/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: And what‚Äôs so significant about his hometown
11/13/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: It's Danish suburbia
11/13/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: So it's relevant in the expansion of the city
11/13/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: But like not actually interesting besides a few buildings by a famous architect
11/13/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Also MY OTHER FIELD STUDY GOT CANCELED
11/13/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: YAY
11/13/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: THATS SOME AMAZING NEWS FOR THE DAY
11/13/19, 11:04 AM - Marianna: what‚Äôs the test and what‚Äôs the essay?
11/13/19, 11:05 AM - Marianna: Is this the essay you were working on yesterday?
11/13/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Test is about a bunch of cancer stuff
11/13/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Essay is about Nordic mythology
11/13/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: And yep! That's the one
11/13/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: Also I've now had my professor ask if he can have some Sudafed
11/13/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: Good ol American pharmaceuticals
11/13/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Oh the one about death!
11/13/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Oh that sounds sketchy
11/13/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: But hey why not
11/13/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt have a medical liscene yet to get taken away
11/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Well he's been super sick and apparently American pharmaceuticals are SUPER nice
11/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Like every time Danes go to the US, they basically bring a bunch back with them
11/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: He's in for a wild ride though
11/13/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Sudafed makes me feel fUnNy
11/13/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Also I now have my Wednesday snail
11/13/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: Man I'm gonna miss these
11/13/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: I'm gonna miss Copenhagen
11/13/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: I found another cute and quiet square that is mine
11/13/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: It is YOURS?
11/13/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Big man on campus over here
11/13/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: I want a Wednesday snail
11/13/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: :(
11/13/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll learn how to make them and do it next semester so you can still have some and I can try one
11/13/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/13/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Okay?
11/13/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs crazy about the pharmaceuticals though
11/13/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: Does that mean our system is better or worse than the Danish one
11/13/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: Okay :)
11/13/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: And idk
11/13/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: It definitely means we have better drugs than them
11/13/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: We may have to pay more for some of them but boy oh boy do they work better
11/13/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: I've said it before and I'll say it again, pharmaceuticals are magic
11/13/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: Also OH MY GOSH
11/13/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
11/13/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: I WENT INTO THIS THRIFT STORE I LIKE BECAUSE I HAD TIME TO KILL
11/13/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: AND I FOUND A PAIR OF SHOES THAT I'VE LITERALLY BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR YEARS
11/13/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: FOR LIKE $35
11/13/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: I'M SO HAPPY
11/13/19, 12:24 PM - Caleb: I also got a scarf I really like
11/13/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 12:25 PM - Caleb: They're nice and in really good condition but they have REALLY interesting history behind them
11/13/19, 12:26 PM - Caleb: They're trainers issued by the German army in the mid 1980s, and they stopped when the soviet union fell
11/13/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Also field trip update: wasn't canceled, just changed so now we're doing a boat tour!
11/13/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Woah
11/13/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Well I guess europe is the place to get those
11/13/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so cool

11/13/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: And YAY BOAT TOUR

11/13/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Big water fan
11/13/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm tired
11/13/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: I may go into a food coma instead of finishing my theory homework
11/13/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: I always* support a food coma
11/13/19, 2:27 PM - Caleb: (* _terms and conditions may apply_)

11/13/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: My heads gonna explode, but out of like cuteness
11/13/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: My heads gonna explode but that‚Äôs just because I am the opposite of sunshine and rainbows right now
11/13/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: I seriously am so stressed
11/13/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: But I love the boat photos!
11/13/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: The selfie one is so creative!
11/13/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: You all look so bundled and nice and warm
11/13/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: And ooooh have any photos of the cafe?
11/13/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Aw I'm sorry you're stressed
11/13/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: What do you have going on?
11/13/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Is there any way I can help?
11/13/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: Receive*
11/13/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Pictures don't do it justice, it's in a tiny old house and the downstairs and outside are decorated for Christmas too
11/13/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: What don‚Äôt I have going on
11/13/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: I think writing it out will stress me out
11/13/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a lot
11/13/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: At least for me to conceive that I have to do it all within the next few days
11/13/19, 6:07 PM - Marianna: It is cute!
11/13/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Your friends are such models
11/13/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: It looks almost like homey like it would make sense students would work there
11/13/19, 6:09 PM - Marianna: Like it seems like you all could live upstairs
11/13/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: You know what I miss
11/13/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Just dance
11/13/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/13/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/13/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: It's all gonna work out
11/13/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: You've got it
11/13/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Just commit and stay focused and you'll make it
11/13/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: And OH my gosh just dance
11/13/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Know what I miss though?
11/13/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Little big planet
11/13/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: Top notch bonding with that game
11/13/19, 8:55 PM - Caleb: Fun Caleb fact
11/13/19, 8:56 PM - Caleb: I used to hate competitive games
11/13/19, 8:56 PM - Caleb: HATED them
11/13/19, 8:56 PM - Caleb: I refused to play if it wasn't cooperative
11/13/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: Yeah I started mobile which made me feel a little bit better about the amount of work I have
11/13/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm creating an app which is using art that adelle made and my HEART
11/13/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I know little big planet
11/13/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: And wow
11/13/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: I only like competitive games
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôd say whoever won picked what game we played next
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: So sometimes I‚Äôd let Joey pick first
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôd undoubtably win
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: And then pick just dance
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: Which I always won
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: So itd turn into just dance for the rest of the day
11/13/19, 9:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm an awful older sister but whatever
11/13/19, 9:36 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been!
11/13/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: AWWWWW
11/13/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: Little big planet! It's basically a game where you get to be super creative and solve puzzles and make your own stages and you're a little character called sackboy that you get to dress up
11/13/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: I'll show you sometime
11/13/19, 9:55 PM - Caleb: You'd have LOVED it
11/13/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: The later games let you do all sorts of fun stuff like design circuit boards and logic puzzles and program NPCs
11/13/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: But it was the only game I could play with my brothers and their friends could and get along
11/13/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: So I've got lots of good memories with it
11/13/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Also yeah you're cruel
11/13/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: Poor Joey
11/13/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh that does sound amazing
11/13/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm amazed my parents never made us play it
11/13/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: They were very into making us do brain games
11/13/19, 10:10 PM - Marianna: And summer homework workbooks
11/13/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Like we had to do a certain number of pages of math before we could read for fun or something
11/13/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: But hey whatever they did worked out for me
11/13/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Man
11/13/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: If nate didn't just break our PS3, I'd say I would bring it down to play
11/13/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Maybe I could emulate it or something
11/13/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: It was so so so much fun
11/13/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: And honesty stoked my creativity and curiousity
11/13/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: You really would have loved it
11/13/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: But hey yeah you turned out alright
11/13/19, 10:19 PM - Caleb: And my nights been okay! Boat tour was fun, then Hannah and I got dinner with my dad which was a lot of fun but quite long
11/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: And after that, we've just been studying for a few hours now
11/13/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: How's your day been?
11/13/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: GOT
11/13/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: AN
11/13/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: ESSAY
11/13/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: EXTENSION
11/13/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Gosh what a Nate thing to do
11/13/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Kidding
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Well if you still have the disk for it I‚Äôm pretty sure we still have a working PS3 and if it‚Äôs not in Maryland, Joey could have brought it davidson. Idk if judy let him or not
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Or wait
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: We have an Xbox
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: No play station
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs all joeys world in the basement of cables and games
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: AND CONGRATES
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: CONGRATS
11/13/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve had a pretty okay night
11/13/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: I mean, honestly yeah a bit of a nate move
11/13/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Not as stressed as I was earlier but I also want to sleep already
11/13/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: The true nate move is that he didn't pay for any of the PS3, but still wants money for selling the games and broken ps3
11/13/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: Nooooo that's the worst
11/13/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: I'm debating not working on my essay tonight and just sleeping
11/13/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: But thats super unwise
11/13/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Any highlights? Things you're looking forward to?
11/13/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Just finished theory!
11/13/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: And I submitted mobile today
11/13/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Wait not mobile
11/13/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: Still got lots of mobile to do
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Submitted crypto today
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Also dude
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: I realize I have 3 final exams and 4 final projects
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Do that math
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Because I don‚Äôt want to
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a lot
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: But hey _LATER_ right
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: And hey you should work on your Edda
11/13/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Essay
11/13/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: I am going to go to bed because I have all tomorrow to devote to mobile and then my amazon assessment
11/13/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Hey!
11/13/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: You got this all!
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: You see it on the horizon which means you can do something about it
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: No I hate horizon things
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: And also it's funny you typed Edda
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I like obstacles to come at me one at a time
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Because that's the main mythological text of Nordic mythology
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Which is unrealistic
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Okay
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Well
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: In that case you can do what I did last semester
11/13/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs how I tackle them even if there are many of them
11/13/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: 7 assessments in two weeks, and just take the punches as they come
11/13/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt juggle well but I do prioritize well and make deadlines well
11/13/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: It sucks but it's over
11/13/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Well either way you got this
11/13/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Go to bed and get some sleep though
11/13/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: I'll be up for a little while still
11/13/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs night
11/13/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Bite*
11/13/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: No no don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not going to bed yet
11/13/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Ah okay?
11/13/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm finishing my beer
11/13/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Dude I love doing homework and drinking
11/13/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs SUCH a mood
11/13/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: I also should shower and then sleep
11/13/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Ahhhh
11/13/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: But Mar
11/13/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Have you ever had a shower beer
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: No
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs almost gone and it‚Äôs in a mug
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Seems logistically challenging
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôve also seen my shower
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: No where to put the beer
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Get a bottle
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Hold it and just shower, relax, and drink
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Hot water
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Cold beer
11/13/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: Good time
11/13/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Oh hey also, I thought about something I appreciate about you today
11/13/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: You and I get stressed about very different things, and it's really nice to be able to hear you and talk to you without getting sympathetically stressed out
11/13/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: It's like talking to you actually helps a lot and I really appreciate that
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: We don‚Äôt do bottles beer here
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs all tall boys
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Pretty much
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: But thank you for the suggestion
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm much more likely to grab a bottle and wine for the shower I think though
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Oh or for a tub
11/13/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Bubble bath and wine sounds nice
11/13/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Okay not to stress you out
11/13/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: But then what do you get stressed out about?
11/13/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm glad my stress doesn‚Äôt stress you out
11/13/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Because I stress a lot
11/13/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Or like not that much but when I do it‚Äôs a lot usually I guess
11/13/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Oh that reminds me
11/13/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Something I've wanted to do for a long time is just get a nice AirBnB in the mountains at some point, with like a bubble bath or something nice like that
11/13/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Almost like a weekend getaway
11/13/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll do it next semester at Davison
11/13/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Anyway
11/13/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: About the stress thing
11/13/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Like I stress out about my friends, or Chem, or med school stuff, or research, or whatever else is going on
11/13/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: And me being stressed about that doesn't stress you out
11/13/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: And there's a thing here or there, but they're small
11/13/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: And you've got similar things
11/13/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: But neither of us are involved in really any way with the source of the other person's stress, so its really nice to be able to talk to someone outside the situation and know I'm not furthering or hurting anyway
11/13/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: So math modeling is going to royally fuck up that system
11/13/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: But we‚Äôll cross that bridge when we get there
11/13/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: And yeah that‚Äôs a good point
11/13/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: But okay
11/13/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Bedtime over here
11/13/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll talk to ya tomorrow!  Remember you‚Äôre a cool cat
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyeaaaahhhhhhdidntthinkofthat
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: It'll be fine
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: We'll be fine
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: It'll be great
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: We'll be great
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Sleep tight for real now
11/13/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Talk to ya tomorrow
11/14/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: Update I've booked the Greece trip
11/14/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: I feel bad for Derek and woo, but no amount of planning would pull together flights and rooming 5 days from now
11/14/19, 12:31 AM - Caleb: If I were smart I would have done this week's ago
11/14/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: But hey whatcha gonna do besides not that in the future
11/14/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: It was $200 for last minute flights, which honestly isn't too terrible
11/14/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: But yeah
11/14/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: Goodnight
11/14/19, 12:32 AM - Caleb: Hope you're sleeping well
11/14/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: Honestly it's just such a relief to have a plan now
11/14/19, 12:36 AM - Caleb: Also I learned this weekend that Reid is gonna be in Budapest!
11/14/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: Good morning
11/14/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: And yay for Greece!!
11/14/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: So far from Copenhagen
11/14/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: I almost wished I had been able to get to Greece this semester
11/14/19, 7:22 AM - Marianna: Which cities?
11/14/19, 7:23 AM - Marianna: I mean you could always send them your plans and say if you can figure out how to make this work for you, you‚Äôre welcome to join
11/14/19, 7:24 AM - Marianna: And all I‚Äôm all $200 for flights from Copenhagen to Greece is really not bad. Like it‚Äôs a long flight. I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised if they were that expensive normally
11/14/19, 7:24 AM - Marianna: And yay for Reid!
11/14/19, 7:25 AM - Marianna: I doubt we‚Äôll have any overlap of when he‚Äôs here but if he needs info, you‚Äôve got it or I can give him some tips.
11/14/19, 7:25 AM - Marianna: I would recommend telling him about the 100E bus to get to the city. Tickets are $3. Much better than a cab, which is what some people do.
11/14/19, 9:48 AM - Caleb: So for Greece I'm spending four nights in Athens and one night in Riga
11/14/19, 9:51 AM - Caleb: And yeah, I was debating that, but then I'd have to plan everything alone and hope things work out for them
11/14/19, 9:51 AM - Caleb: And if they didn't, I'd be committed to spending the week alone in Italy
11/14/19, 9:51 AM - Caleb: Which doesn't sound awful, but I want to spend it with friends
11/14/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: Wait so are you going with other people to Greece?
11/14/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: And ooooh have so much fun
11/14/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm exhausted
11/14/19, 10:04 AM - Marianna: Gonna nap before I do work today
11/14/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm wearing my really fuzzy scarf I got in Amsterdam
11/14/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: So I am so fuzzy
11/14/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: Sleep is calling me
11/14/19, 10:05 AM - Marianna: But our prof is calling us to stay awake more
11/14/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: Yeah, there was a group of like 10 people including Hannah and Hans who were going to Greece
11/14/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: And they rented a whole flat
11/14/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: And I've been invited for a while, I just had other people trying to do things because I'm just _SO_ popular
11/14/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: You know how it is
11/14/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: And awwwwww that sounds comfy
11/14/19, 10:18 AM - Caleb: But hey you need to wake up, class is fun right?
11/14/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Oh my gosh that sounds like so much fun
11/14/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I thought you were gonna go alone so I was confused
11/14/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: But that sounds like an absolute blast!
11/14/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: And yes yes we know you‚Äôre _soOooOooOoOo_ popular
11/14/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Wow look at me
11/14/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Dating a #popular kid
11/14/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Does this make me popular by proxy?
11/14/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: No class was theory
11/14/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Puts me to sleep
11/14/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: But we did stuff today that is vaguely reminiscent of discrete
11/14/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: And do you really have to take that class next semester my life would be so much better if it has less discrete math in it this might be the dealbreaker
11/14/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Kidding!  I am hoping you get it so you can graduate on time and all that
11/14/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: And I may even help you with it if you need
11/14/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: MAY
11/14/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Well Marianna, we're gonna make you pop-u-lar!
11/14/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: I'll help you be popular!
You'll hang with all the right cohorts, you'll be good at sports, know the slang you've got to know!
11/14/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: üéµüé∂
11/14/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Also, well fortunately for you I'm not in Discreet at the moment
11/14/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: #thankswebtree
11/14/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: #thanksadddrop
11/14/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: #thanksT&I
11/14/19, 11:09 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah you can‚Äôt be popular is you just made that reference
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: Actually that‚Äôs such a lie wicked is pretty main stream
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: And hey
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: Ceiling extension
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôll get it
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: The math cs dept is pretty chill about it
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: And tommy c will be more than happy to have more people who want to take the class in his class
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Yay
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Then maybe I'll get to meet Dashi
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: Also just missed a train so it will be cold for a long time
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Marianna: Hmm
11/14/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: The real reason for wanting his class
11/14/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: NOOOOOO
11/14/19, 11:11 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs Sarahs territory
11/14/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: Well uh
11/14/19, 11:11 AM - Marianna: Dashi doesn‚Äôt real come to class
11/14/19, 11:11 AM - Caleb: I don't have a clever rebuttal
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: Also you know you're proud of me for the wicked reference
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Sarah does want to have dashi sleepover at some point next semester but I‚Äôd rather not have a giant husky who sheds and jumps and scratches in my room
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: Just a little
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: So I have to figure out how to deal with that
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: And yes
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Twas good
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhhhhhaaaa not a huge Dashi fan are you
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: No I love dashi
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Just not in my room
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: I like her outside
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Or in the Cameron‚Äôs house
11/14/19, 11:12 AM - Marianna: Which has been dashi proofed
11/14/19, 11:13 AM - Marianna: I also do think I‚Äôm allergic to her
11/14/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: Good
11/14/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: Getchu a mans who can reference musicals which he may or may not have seen
11/14/19, 11:15 AM - Caleb: OH NO
11/14/19, 11:16 AM - Caleb: How are you and Sarah even friends then!
11/14/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Well you know me and my habit of ignoring that I have allergies
11/14/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôve never been with her for so long that I feel awful afterwards
11/14/19, 11:33 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm not sure I want dashi hair all over my room and dashi has no boundaries like she‚Äôd jump on my bed and get really excited in a new situation that she‚Äôd jump and run and stuff
11/14/19, 11:33 AM - Marianna: I guess we could dogproof the room
11/14/19, 11:34 AM - Marianna: Anyway
11/14/19, 11:34 AM - Marianna: How are you today?
11/14/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: I'm pretty good
11/14/19, 11:48 AM - Caleb: I've been kinda slacking on this paper, but it's all I'm planning on doing tonight after this test is over
11/14/19, 11:48 AM - Caleb: But my slacking is making me more stressed
11/14/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: And the last thing I want to do is have Friday night and just be like "yeah sorry dad I can't hang out I need to finish this", and especially if it's my own fault
11/14/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: But other than that, pretty decent
11/14/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: I know this might sound dumb, but I have an outfit on that I really like today, so just because of that it's off to a good start
11/14/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: And I've got a class that I really like, and I like the professor, and she made a comment in our meeting that she appreciates me in class
11/14/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: So I'm quite happy
11/14/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: How are you? How's your day been?
11/14/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah I hate to break it to you but you need to work on that paper so you can hang with your dad
11/14/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs coming from a serial procrastinator
11/14/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: Oh if you haven‚Äôt already had the text good luck!
11/14/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: And if you have I‚Äôm sure you did great!
11/14/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: Hey I totally get the outfit thing
11/14/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: And now I need a mirror pic of this wonderful outfit
11/14/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/14/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: Just how it is
11/14/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good
11/14/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm fighting with my mobile homework
11/14/19, 2:08 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like we have a demo that is basically the homework but we need to replicate it but there are so many intricate parts I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out what is what
11/14/19, 2:09 PM - Marianna: I may give my brain a rest and take a break and nap soon
11/14/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: Well Marianna great news
11/14/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: I've been writing at 1.5 spacing and am sitting at 6.5ish
11/14/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: Other kids have been doing 2
11/14/19, 3:12 PM - Caleb: Which means I'm now at 8
11/14/19, 3:12 PM - Caleb: So all I need is a conclusion and editing
11/14/19, 3:12 PM - Caleb: I know you're probably busy, but if I sent you a copy would you mind giving it a read tonight?
11/14/19, 3:12 PM - Caleb: I totally get it though if you're too busy, I'll be okay and you've got your own stuff to worry about
11/14/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: And ha, I'll get one to you later
11/14/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: (a mirror selfie)
11/14/19, 3:13 PM - Caleb: And get that nap! I'd say you've officially earned it
11/14/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Well that test was subprime
11/14/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh Caleb the nap
11/14/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: It was so good
11/14/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: But now it‚Äôs dark and I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed
11/14/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Not good
11/14/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: But yay about your paper!!
11/14/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: You can definitely send it my way
11/14/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: I can read it while eating dinner or after my amazon thing probably
11/14/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: What time are you starting the Amazon assessment?
11/14/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: Probably 8
11/14/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm also gonna make a poor decisions right now and drink coffee this late in the day
11/14/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: But I need it
11/14/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/14/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: You
11/14/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Good luck, you got this
11/14/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: But any way it goes, I'm still proud of you and you're awesome
11/14/19, 5:31 PM - Marianna: Well thank you
11/14/19, 5:31 PM - Marianna: I think this part will go better than the last part did and I thought I failed the last part so hey
11/14/19, 5:31 PM - Marianna: Whatever
11/14/19, 5:31 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre just trying to get a job
11/14/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/14/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: He is remarkably perfect
11/14/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: Okay so I‚Äôve got a bug that I‚Äôve never encountered before about something I‚Äôm pretty sure I did right so I sent an email to the prof but I can‚Äôt even debug any of the rest of the code until this gets resolved
11/14/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: So while that means I can‚Äôt be productive rn
11/14/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: It does mean I DONT HAVE TO BE PRODUCTIVE RN
11/14/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: well I‚Äôll probably look at other homework but still
11/14/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Blessing and a curse
11/14/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh
11/14/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: The pseudo-relaxation
11/14/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Something I know so well
11/14/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Good luck with that
11/14/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: And HEY GOOD LUCK ON YOUR AMAZON THING
11/14/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES
11/14/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Thanks
11/14/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna start in a minute
11/14/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Wooooo
11/14/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Prof still hasn‚Äôt gotten back to me so hopefully he will tomorrow
11/14/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Mobile hw isn‚Äôt due until Monday at midnight or really Tuesday at midnight because he lets us have 24 hrs before penalizing us so I‚Äôm feeling okay about it as long as this bug gets fixed and then I don‚Äôt hit any other major roadblocks
11/14/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: It it's a 24 hour grace period without penalty, doesn't that just mean that it's due 24 hours after the deadline
11/14/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: That's kind of a weird approach
11/14/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: DONE WITH THE ESSAY
11/14/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: WOOOO
11/14/19, 9:34 PM - Caleb: Now to reward myself with brooklyn nine nine and a cold drink
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs weird but it‚Äôs hidden in the instructions so only those who read it and the syllabus fully can take advantage of it
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: He got back to me!
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: And he said after he fixed that he had no errors!
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: Nice
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: And congrats!
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: Have you see Brooklyn nine nine before?
11/14/19, 9:41 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm gonna look at your essay in a minute
11/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: HEY!
11/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: How did it go?
11/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: And that's awesome! Nice work on the homework
11/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: And nope, I'm on my first watch through
11/14/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: I'm currently on the beginning of season 2
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Have you seen it before?
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: I think it went well!
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Now we wait and see I guess
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: They usually email around 6am if there is a next part
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Woah, that soon?
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: But this was the end of the assessment sequence so maybe not
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: That's wild
11/14/19, 9:43 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/14/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: You got a lot of work left tonight?
11/14/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Well for the part 1‚Äì>part 2‚Äì>part 3 that‚Äôs what they did because they just had to check if you passed and then you get the next part
11/14/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Not really
11/14/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: May finish the beer that I started yesterday and watch jane the virgin and go to bed
11/14/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Would you maybe want to call tonight for a little bit?
11/14/19, 9:44 PM - Caleb: Ahh that sounds nice
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs extra credit for crypto that‚Äôs due Sunday that I should probably look at but i think my brains done
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: I totally get if you just want to relax
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: And sure!
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: Hey
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: Do you really think talking to you isn‚Äôt relaxing?
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: You might cause me sleep deprivation
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs at least not stressful sleep deprivation
11/14/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: :)
11/14/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: I mean, I was hoping, but hey that's lovely to hear
11/14/19, 9:46 PM - Caleb: Just let me know whenever you want, I'll be around if you want to finish your episode or something
11/14/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Morten warmind is a fucking legendary name
11/14/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: I FUCKING KNOW
11/14/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: FOR A NORDIC MYTHOLOGY PROFESSOR TOO
11/14/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: WARMIND?!?
11/14/19, 9:47 PM - Caleb: I mean come on now
11/14/19, 9:50 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs amazing
11/14/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: He was meant to do what he‚Äôs doing
11/14/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Oh 100%
11/14/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Also I'm now drinking wine
11/14/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Out of my special Instant cup
11/14/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: :)))
11/14/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Hii
11/14/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Ah that made me smile
11/14/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: You gotta tell Reid about instant!
11/14/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: Is he going with people!
11/14/19, 10:08 PM - Marianna: (You also need to tell Reid he‚Äôll need to get forints for drinks at bars)
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Yep! Emma and Caroline!
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: And hi!
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Emma is roommate?
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: ... Yep
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think Ive heard of caroline
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: But maybe I have
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: You just have soooooo many friends
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Being so popular and all that
11/14/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/14/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Emma left, Caroline right
11/14/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: She's Emma's friend who I used to hang out with a bit
11/14/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Not anymore though
11/14/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: She's pretty nice
11/14/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And yeah, I'm just SOOOOOOOO popular
11/14/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Hope you're ready to be a Davidson power couple or something
11/14/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Uh I‚Äôm sorry
11/14/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: You obviously have overlooked that I don‚Äôt think I could ever been part of a power couple
11/14/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Idk who is a power couple on campus honestly
11/14/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Like what makes a power couple a power couple
11/14/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Is it just that people know you?
11/14/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Because like in my opinion audrey and drake are a power couple but they‚Äôre probably not really
11/14/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/14/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: MITCH AND MARION
11/14/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: definitely
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Nah
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: I don't think so
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: I literally didn't know mitch existed until DC
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: WHAT
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: And I barely knew who Marion was tbh
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: you see
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: I just remember seeing her around a few times
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: This is why power couples don‚Äôt exist
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: Nope
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Caleb: They do
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Like they exist within social spheres maybe
11/14/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Okay name one
11/14/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: It's more of a high school thing though
11/14/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Okay, Cam and Rachel
11/14/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Okay that‚Äôs a fair one
11/14/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: But like they don‚Äôt have power on campus
11/14/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre just known on campus
11/14/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's the extent of Davidson's Powe couples
11/14/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: It's all just people who are well known
11/14/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: No one has massive social influence though
11/14/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: It's just not the way Davidson operates
11/14/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: It's absolutely uncondusive to power couples
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: I like it that way I think
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Also I'm not sure I would have enough social sway to make a power couple
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Sorry to let ya down
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Do you want feedback for your essay or are you already submitted?
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: I'm in the circles but I don't have the social capital
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: And yes please! I was gonna submit tomorrow after class
11/14/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Also please don't judge me on it, I'm sure it's not that good
11/14/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm gonna put comments in the google doc for ya. You can take them or leave them
11/14/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not going to be much
11/14/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Remember my brain wants to stop thinking
11/14/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: Okay! Thank you so much
11/14/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: Don't stress about it, and when you're done, want to call?
11/14/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: How confident are you in comma rules
11/14/19, 10:33 PM - Marianna: And yes I‚Äôll let you know when!
11/14/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: In a rough draft I tend to type how I talk.
11/14/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: So not very
11/14/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: I know my apositives though
11/14/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: They're my favorite grammatical embellishment
11/14/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even know what an appositive is
11/14/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Okay I googled them
11/14/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/14/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Good stuff
11/14/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt use them much
11/14/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Fun fact, the teacher that taught me that was allergic to apples
11/14/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Just like yoooou
11/14/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: She also had apple paraphernalia EVERYWHERE in her room
11/14/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: It was a weird "forbidden fruit" thing for her
11/14/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Mennonite school is weird man
11/14/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Wow. Lotta bad commas in there
11/14/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: My mother would be so disappointed
11/14/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Reminder I‚Äôm a math major
11/14/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: You did ask a math major to edit a paper
11/14/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: But i am pretty sure I know my comma rules
11/14/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I thought the material was fantastic though
11/14/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm gonna put contacts in then I‚Äôll call for a bit
11/14/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Yay :)
11/14/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Glad you liked it
11/14/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Comma shitshow and all
11/14/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Shitshow is a strong word for it
11/14/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: But yes
11/14/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: And I think morten would have with the commas still all over the place
11/14/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: But hey that‚Äôs all I could see improvement in
11/14/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Ready for phone call?
11/14/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Yep!

11/15/19, 7:36 AM - Marianna: Good morning
11/15/19, 7:39 AM - Caleb: Good mooorning
11/15/19, 7:48 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm still in bed
11/15/19, 7:48 AM - Marianna: Debating not going to crypto
11/15/19, 7:48 AM - Marianna: But I know o need to
11/15/19, 7:49 AM - Marianna: But at this point I don‚Äôt think I have time for breakfast and I just want to stay here
11/15/19, 7:49 AM - Marianna: :
11/15/19, 7:49 AM - Marianna: :(
11/15/19, 8:10 AM - Marianna: I just walked past like normal people around a table outside a bar full in having beers at 8am?  Are they still awake from last night?  Would that make it better than if they woke up and hour ago and met up for beers at 8am?
11/15/19, 8:36 AM - Caleb: I'm guessing you got up?
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Also yeah, I don't think I have an answer for you there
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Some people are wild
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Sadly yes
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: 8am beers sounds like a lot
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Ahhhh
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Waiting for the shuttle now
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: :(
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Well
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Good job
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: üëçüëç
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Caleb: Two thumbs up
11/15/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: Thank you thank you
11/15/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs raining and cold up here north of buda
11/15/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Not a fan
11/15/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: It was nice in the city
11/15/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll just go back
11/15/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: Yeah maybe don't do that
11/15/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: Oh gosh
11/15/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Spyros emailed me and were trying to push the journal publication, but my VPN still isn't working and now I'm hella stressed
11/15/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: I made it to class
11/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: And comp bio got canceled
11/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: And ah that‚Äôs stressful I‚Äôm sorry
11/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: Is there anyway to debug what‚Äôs up with the VPN?
11/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: Try another computer?
11/15/19, 10:52 AM - Marianna: (I realize you may not be able to do that if it‚Äôs set up on yours only)
11/15/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: Have you tried turning it off and on again
11/15/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Well so far I've tried reinstalling it, which didn't work
11/15/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: And then I purged all packages with my other VPN, uninstalled and reinstalled, and that didn't work
11/15/19, 11:33 AM - Caleb: And I'm thinking of other options
11/15/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: It's hard because it's not giving any errors
11/15/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: It's letting me log in and gives me the DUO authorization thing, but then it connects and there's no traffic
11/15/19, 11:34 AM - Caleb: So I emailed tech support
11/15/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: I've also tried tracing all traffic through my computer, and it just comes to a standstill
11/15/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: Idk what the deal is
11/15/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: I'm wondering if it has to do with network protocol of DIS
11/15/19, 11:35 AM - Caleb: See this is how I learn about computers
11/15/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Out of necessity
11/15/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: Also I just gave my professor half a box of Sudafed, I better get a good grade on this paper üòÇ
11/15/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs cold here
11/15/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: Me no like
11/15/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: I hate to say it but could it be that you brought a vpn to China?  Like could it have been affected there because of the firewall?
11/15/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Also I just worked on crypto for like two hours and I finally just cracked the cipher and man it makes me so happy when I start getting printable characters out of binary garbage
11/15/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Now heading to a quick lunch before doing Hungarian hw. And none of my friends are here I don‚Äôt think so I‚Äôve got my book to be my date at lunch
11/15/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Dear Marianna
11/15/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Today I learned that the biggest, most famous, most epic viking saga of all time starts with a guy being cursed and having a dick too big for his wife to enjoy
11/15/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: And thus begins the bloodshed and tragedy of the saga of Njal the Burnt
11/15/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: And nope, I only used my phone VPN there
11/15/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Honestly it might be an issue of Chinese malware though
11/15/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Which would mean I need to purge and reinstall my OS
11/15/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Which would absolutely suck
11/15/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Oh no his poor wife
11/15/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: One of my littles has a story about something like that happened
11/15/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: Well would you please get rid of any malware on your machine so it doesn‚Äôt infect others machines
11/15/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt really know how malware works but it would make sense it would propagate itself
11/15/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: Please don't tell me this story involves Patrick

11/15/19, 2:59 PM - Marianna: Not for me

11/15/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: Which would be happy because I found the issue
11/15/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: And then heartbreaking

11/15/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre gonna be getting in soooo late
11/15/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: The eye roll?
11/15/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Yep
11/15/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: I felt that
11/15/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: It's always good to feel you
11/15/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: r eye rolls

11/15/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs fantasy
11/15/19, 10:05 PM - Marianna: And you know I‚Äôm not a big fantasy person
11/15/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: What no never
11/15/19, 10:08 PM - Caleb: What's the book?
11/15/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: ü§™üòâüòè
11/15/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Oathbringer
11/15/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: By Brandon Sanderson
11/15/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: I told you about it a little on the phone forever ago
11/15/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: My mom read the first two to Joey and me during high school
11/15/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: She read them to you?
11/15/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: Also apparently Emma was ranting about me on Wednesday about the dishes
11/15/19, 10:20 PM - Caleb: And now I'm just mad again
11/15/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: No mad
11/15/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Enjoy the drunk and the friends
11/15/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Mad doesn‚Äôt mic well with those
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah my mom did family reading since we were young
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: She read all of Harry Potter to ya
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Us
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: And the inkheart books
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: And this series
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: And a few others over the years
11/15/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôd all lounge on these beanbag/giant pillow things or in the car during long trips and she‚Äôd read
11/15/19, 10:24 PM - Marianna: The giant pillow thing is gonna come to my room this year because we‚Äôll have room
11/15/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Dear Marianna
11/15/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: After a discussion with Derek and woo
11/15/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: It's dawned on me that I had NO RESPONSIBILITY for the dishes the week Emma is complaining about
11/15/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: The weekend i got back, I was responsible for cleaning the common room after the week that it was just hanne and emil
11/15/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: And it was fine
11/15/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: By Tuesday, the time that it wasn't my responsibility, it was filthy and they were other people's dishes
11/15/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: And I'm still getting blamed for it
11/15/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: And Emma is still complaining about it
11/15/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: And I got cornered by Emil and Hanne and got walked all over
11/15/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: Dear Caleb
11/15/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry they‚Äôre being awful about it
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Yeeeaaah
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: You shouldn‚Äôt have to feel awful because you tried to do the nice thing
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a damned if you do situation
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: Because you did clean they assumed you were late with cleaning
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: But really you were doing someone else‚Äôs cleaning
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: So you‚Äôre the star here
11/15/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: But idk
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Not much you can do now
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry Emma‚Äôs such a bitch though
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Like complaining to someone‚Äôs friend about that person is soooooo not a cool move
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt meet her
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Hanne scared me
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think she liked me
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Emil was just drunk
11/15/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: And marion was ogling him
11/15/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: I wish I‚Äôd met Reid though
11/15/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm glad he was gone...
11/15/19, 10:37 PM - Caleb: Oh yeha
11/15/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: That reminds me
11/15/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Emil does some sketch stuff man
11/15/19, 10:38 PM - Caleb: Like he joked about getting girls drunk to sleep with them easily and it really put me off
11/15/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: And Hanne has her moments
11/15/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: But it always feels like she's trying to make up for chewing me out for something
11/15/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/15/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not cool
11/15/19, 10:49 PM - Marianna: Like at all
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: High key predatory and bad
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: High
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: Key
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: Yes
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Euh I just need to shake off the idea that there are actually some people who do that and know they do that and are okay with it
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Meg apparently did that a few times this summer
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: MEG WHAT
11/15/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: NOT COOL
11/15/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: And well I mean she might just like her rules and might feel bad that she‚Äôs like that because you two are different
11/15/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: ^^hanne not meg
11/15/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Yeah a lot of people that saw meg this summer had some issues with her behavior
11/15/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not her biggest after hearing most of what she did since her breakup last semester
11/15/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Like you get to act out a little but not that much for that long
11/15/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: And never get to be predatory or hurtful to others
11/15/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Anyway
11/15/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Yeah she‚Äôs not my favorite person but whatever I‚Äôll still see her next semester so we gotta let by gones be by gones
11/15/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh it is freaking cold on this runway
11/15/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve been standing out here for like 30 min
11/15/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: Wow my face hurts
11/15/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: On the plane though!
11/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Hooray!
11/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Italy soon
11/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: ‚Ñ¢
11/15/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: And yeah, breakups mess with uou
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: You know that
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: I know that
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Meg knows that
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: And you get to do things you regret
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: But not while hurting other people
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: That's a line that's in plain sight
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Well said
11/15/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Italy soon
11/15/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Gotta then on plane mode
11/15/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Szia
11/15/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Ciao
11/15/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Arrividerci
11/15/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: (Until later not for ever you can‚Äôt get away that easily :))
11/15/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Heya
11/15/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: That's all
11/15/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: I'm probably passing out soon
11/15/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Fuck it in voice memoing this
11/15/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: Goodnight!
11/15/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: Send me updates from Milan pls
11/16/19, 12:00 AM - Caleb: I like waking up to texts from you
11/16/19, 12:48 AM - Marianna: Just landed!
11/16/19, 12:48 AM - Marianna: Very tired!
11/16/19, 12:48 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs all the updates I have rn
11/16/19, 12:49 AM - Marianna: But I hope you are asleep and had a great night and don‚Äôt you dare delete that voice memo I gotta listen to it when I get to the Airbnb
11/16/19, 2:33 AM - Marianna: Update we walked 30 min in the dark and rain to get our Airbnb
11/16/19, 2:39 AM - Marianna: Did not get kidnapped though
11/16/19, 2:39 AM - Marianna: So there‚Äôs that
11/16/19, 2:40 AM - Marianna: Also there‚Äôs no way you know what heels feel like
11/16/19, 2:40 AM - Marianna: Okay
11/16/19, 2:40 AM - Marianna: Bedtime
11/16/19, 2:40 AM - Marianna: Goodnight
11/16/19, 7:41 AM - Caleb: Oh boy
11/16/19, 7:42 AM - Caleb: Up early
11/16/19, 7:42 AM - Caleb: Very tired
11/16/19, 7:42 AM - Caleb: God morgen
11/16/19, 7:47 AM - Caleb: Ugh, Woo just got me mad about Emma last night and had my angry ranting for like thirty minutes
11/16/19, 7:47 AM - Caleb: I hate that
11/16/19, 8:00 AM - Caleb: Oh damn
11/16/19, 8:00 AM - Caleb: I was thinking about why she bothers me so much, and I figured it out
11/16/19, 8:00 AM - Caleb: It's not actually her
11/16/19, 8:02 AM - Caleb: It's actually all the circumstances around me that confuse or hurt me which I can't explain or vocalize
11/16/19, 8:04 AM - Caleb: So Emma, being the only person that's clearly wronged me, even if it's not that significant, becomes the scapegoat for all of the emotions of anger and frustration now they have a direction and feel justified
11/16/19, 8:05 AM - Caleb: Boom
11/16/19, 8:05 AM - Caleb: Nothing like an 8am self reflection while walking the streets of Copenhagen before the sun rises
11/16/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: Kierkegaard would be so proud
11/16/19, 8:59 AM - Marianna: Buongiorno !
11/16/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: You do come back to it a lot so I can see it‚Äôs really upsetting you but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve like kind of figured out why it‚Äôs getting to you
11/16/19, 9:05 AM - Marianna: Why are you up so early?
11/16/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: Yeah
11/16/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: And honestly I still don't like her as a person, but I'm not mad at her anymore
11/16/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: It was surprisingly fast and therapeutic to just realize what was really bothering me
11/16/19, 9:07 AM - Caleb: But yeah, I think I'm over it now
11/16/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: It's really not worth more time and energy
11/16/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: And honestly part of it was a realization about myself too
11/16/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: What made it click was that something similar happened with Chris last year, and I used to just lay on Jenn and Meredith's floor and be livid anytime he did something
11/16/19, 9:10 AM - Caleb: But in retrospect, it was a lot of pent up pain because of Elise and my friend group braking up and all sorts of other things-- I just didn't have any direction for it until Chris was unfair
11/16/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: And I was taking my dad to the airport! I'm on my way back right now though
11/16/19, 9:11 AM - Caleb: It was weird going to an airport with bags early in the morning, walking to security, then just turning around and leaving
11/16/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: I do the exact same thing with people
11/16/19, 10:24 AM - Marianna: Like I can usually recognize in the moment like I‚Äôm not really mad at them I‚Äôm just frustrated in general
11/16/19, 10:24 AM - Marianna: And aw I‚Äôm sorry that must have been hard to say goodbye
11/16/19, 10:26 AM - Marianna: On the bus to Milan!!
11/16/19, 10:40 AM - Caleb: Honestly it wasn't bad
11/16/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: I'm gonna be home in 28 days
11/16/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: And yeah, I guess I haven't been considering that, but now I just feel way better. I had a good conversation with Emil this morning, and when things come up it'll be easy to recognize that I'm just frustrated
11/16/19, 10:42 AM - Caleb: And woohoo! What are your plans for the day?
11/16/19, 10:44 AM - Caleb: Also I just had a piece of bread and looked at the next one and there's a HUGE mold spot on it so I'm probably going to die sorry
11/16/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: Woah that‚Äôs crazy to think about
11/16/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: Well we‚Äôre currently still trying to get to the Airbnb
11/16/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre really gonna spend most of our time here commuting
11/16/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: And NOOOO
11/16/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/16/19, 11:47 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve eaten my fair share of moldy bread
11/16/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: Specifically moldy gourd bread
11/16/19, 11:48 AM - Marianna: Because it‚Äôs hard to see mold in like baked pumpkin bread
11/16/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: Ahh I'm sorry
11/16/19, 12:14 PM - Caleb: At least you've got good company though
11/16/19, 12:15 PM - Caleb: Let me know when you start actually exploring and seeing Milan!
11/16/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve been exploring!
11/16/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: Gotten many many photos
11/16/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: Just went to Louis Vuitton
11/16/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt buy anything don‚Äôt worry
11/16/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: But we did all spray ourselves with _260‚Ç¨_ perfume testers so we smell v good right now
11/16/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Is it...
11/16/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Is it weird to say I wanna smell you right now?
11/16/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: I'm wondering what 260‚Ç¨ perfume smells like
11/16/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Because I'm guessing it's incredible
11/16/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Which reminds me, I found a cologne I really like and I'm debating buying it for Christmas, but also I want your input on it
11/16/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Or asking for it for Christmas
11/16/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Also why would I worry if you bought something from LV
11/16/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Should that worry me?
11/16/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: I mean it doesn‚Äôt smell all that different than a normal costing perfume in my opinion
11/16/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Well if you want to just tell me what it is I could maybe find it in a store and go smell it?
11/16/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/16/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: I also probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that until I got back to the states
11/16/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Oh that could be what we do when I land on philly
11/16/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: And well I think it should be concerning to anyone in my life that I‚Äôm buying Louis Vuitton
11/16/19, 4:47 PM - Caleb: There's probably a duty free shop in the Brussels  airport, I'll just try it there or something
11/16/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: Also why's that? I never got the appeal of Louis Vuitton but hey its fine other people do
11/16/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: I mean how expensive can it _really_ be
11/16/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: Oh holy shit nevermind that's a lot of money
11/16/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Yeah no Louis Vuitton is insane
11/16/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Especially in euros
11/16/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: And in Milan
11/16/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: Wait a second YOU'RE WITH ELENA!!
11/16/19, 5:29 PM - Caleb: She's awesome.
11/16/19, 5:30 PM - Caleb: Also I'm so glad that worked out for you, that's absolutely wonderful to hear
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Wait
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve told you about this
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Elena is my little
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah but it just clicked again
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah I know that
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/16/19, 5:43 PM - Marianna: Good job
11/16/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: It was more of an "OH THAT'S RIGHT"
11/16/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: Classic Van Regenmorter household
11/16/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs good
11/16/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good to only know some words that are yelled at you
11/16/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: But maybe not useful if you actually want to converse POLITELY with someone in dutch
11/16/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Oh did I tell you being here in Italy is making me so much want to be actually able to speak this language
11/16/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: I hate depending on English man
11/16/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: I meaaaaaaaaan
11/16/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: And yeah, it's nice to be proficient and not make people use English
11/16/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Its part of why Chinese was low key fun
11/16/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: I literally couldn't use English most of the time so even though my Chinese was so shoddy, it was useful and made sense
11/16/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: I always have a little bit of guilt with making people use English
11/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Caleb
11/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I have such an important announcement
11/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I have pumpkin ravioli in a sage sauce
11/16/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: And sparking wine
11/16/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: SEND NOODZ

11/16/19, 9:28 PM - Marianna: I swear
11/16/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: We are heading to get gelato and then drink a bottle of wine and a fifth of limoncello
11/16/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôve somehow made Marion okay with staying in tonight
11/16/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre gonna have our own club in our Airbnb
11/16/19, 9:30 PM - Marianna: Partially because the Airbnb is so far away from the city center and metros stop at midnight
11/16/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: A bottle of wine a person?
11/16/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Also I'm sorry about your AirBnB
11/16/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: That sounds suboptimal
11/16/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: On the bright side we're in the center of Brussels
11/16/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Also I'm amazed you got Marion to stay in
11/16/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: No wine bottle total
11/16/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: We have a whole thing of 30% limoncello
11/16/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: And we smol people caleb

11/16/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: And me too!
11/16/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: Am I hearing that I'll get drunk texts later?

11/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Like we really only saw the duomo
11/17/19, 12:31 AM - Marianna: Which was awesome
11/17/19, 12:33 AM - Caleb: You saw the Duomo with your family right?
11/17/19, 12:50 AM - Marianna: Not this duomo
11/17/19, 12:50 AM - Marianna: Everything is a duomo in Italian

11/17/19, 12:53 AM - Marianna: Just like the rest of the world
11/17/19, 12:53 AM - Marianna: You think just because you‚Äôre dating the artist you get early access?!?!?
11/17/19, 12:54 AM - Caleb: I mean
11/17/19, 12:54 AM - Caleb: Honestly yeah
11/17/19, 12:55 AM - Caleb: I'd like to think I've got a special status
11/17/19, 12:55 AM - Caleb: And also where am I gonna see it, Instagram?
11/17/19, 12:55 AM - Caleb: Instagram got purged and good riddens

11/17/19, 1:09 AM - Caleb: S√∏ren you lucky dog
11/17/19, 1:09 AM - Caleb: Also I feel like "crazy but we love her" encompasses half your friend group
11/17/19, 1:10 AM - Caleb: Wait does that encompass you
11/17/19, 1:10 AM - Caleb: Oh no
11/17/19, 1:12 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm

11/17/19, 1:21 AM - Marianna: No
11/17/19, 1:21 AM - Marianna: Sorry
11/17/19, 1:25 AM - Marianna: Marion was just talking about her hooking up with mitch and some chorale girl and I got really kind of freaked out honeslty because I realize I remember not much from frolics Friday and I hate that and i idk why I‚Äôm saying this you probably don‚Äôt want this text but idk I just got so not comfortable with it almost like guilt of being crazy so I don‚Äôt want to talk about being crazy because I don‚Äôt consider myself a crazy person really and idk I should have my memory from frolics Friday but maybe it‚Äôs almost a blessing I don‚Äôt
11/17/19, 1:25 AM - Marianna: So change of topic
11/17/19, 1:25 AM - Marianna: Is what I‚Äôm asking
11/17/19, 1:25 AM - Marianna: Now we‚Äôre talking about Owen

11/17/19, 1:31 AM - Caleb: It doesn't make you crazy, and besides that was a past you

11/17/19, 1:33 AM - Caleb: And my day was okay
11/17/19, 1:33 AM - Caleb: I didn't do a whole lot because I felt like garbage for most of it
11/17/19, 1:34 AM - Caleb: Then I hung out with Hanne and Emil, did some homework, made dinner, then had a few drinks with Woo and Derek
11/17/19, 1:34 AM - Caleb: And now I'm cozy in bed
11/17/19, 1:36 AM - Marianna: Hi

11/17/19, 1:52 AM - Caleb: I was still able to ride a bike though
11/17/19, 1:53 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to talk about it because I just don‚Äôt want to acknowledge it happened but people keep bringing it up including me but it‚Äôs like wow this makes me interesting but I was blackout and wish I hadn‚Äôt so no buono

11/17/19, 2:59 AM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt wait until I don‚Äôt have to text you all my drunk thoughts and I can just whisper them to you as you tell me to stfu and go to bed
11/17/19, 2:59 AM - Marianna: Hey as betsy has been counting down ‚Äú1 month and 26 days until we all get back to campus‚Äù
11/17/19, 2:59 AM - Marianna: We can do that
11/17/19, 3:00 AM - Marianna: Or well I can
11/17/19, 3:00 AM - Marianna: I want to
11/17/19, 3:00 AM - Marianna: Nothing compared to what we have done right

11/17/19, 10:16 AM - Caleb: Yeah me too
11/17/19, 10:16 AM - Caleb: I don't feel hungover, just a little gross
11/17/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: I got decent sleep though
11/17/19, 10:17 AM - Caleb: I think
11/17/19, 10:19 AM - Caleb: Also yeah! It would be fun to do a countdown to campus
11/17/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: I actually thought about this really early in the semester, but didn't want to make it feel like I just got here and was already trying to leave
11/17/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: Currently it's exactly 50 days for me!
11/17/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/17/19, 10:27 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/17/19, 10:45 AM - Marianna: Yeah I just feel gross and we only got like 6 hours
11/17/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: Betsys countdown is to when she‚Äôll have sex again (ie see soren) so it‚Äôs a little different for her
11/17/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: But wow!  That‚Äôs like no time at all
11/17/19, 10:46 AM - Marianna: And oh my gosh the love I currently have for Charlie is so much I cannot put it into words
11/17/19, 10:47 AM - Marianna: What a good Christmas pup
11/17/19, 10:47 AM - Marianna: Are your parents getting out the Christmas stuff to decorate?
11/17/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhhh okay Betsy
11/17/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: I'll tell you what if you want to do a countdown, I'll settle for just being for seeing each other/being on campus together
11/17/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: And I KNOW IT'S SO SOON
11/17/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: I'm at 27 days to flying home
11/17/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: I'm spooped
11/17/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: And not sure, usually we wait until after Thanksgiving but they might be doing it early
11/17/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Yeah that works for me üòä
11/17/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I still have like 40 days?
11/17/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: No more like 35
11/17/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Yeah my dads a decorate-day-after-thanksgiving kind of person
11/17/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: He doesn‚Äôt always get it done that day but that‚Äôs his goal
11/17/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: Hey
11/17/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: Miss you
11/17/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: And I know it‚Äôs early in the day for that
11/17/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: But yeah
11/17/19, 12:09 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your day like today?
11/17/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Well
11/17/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: It's currently noon and I made breakfast
11/17/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: So that's how it's going so far
11/17/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: It's leftover pasta aglio e olio with a fried egg on top
11/17/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: And it's just going to be a homework day for me probably
11/17/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: And other than that
11/17/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Idk, maybe be social and hang with people this afternoon?
11/17/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: Not really exciting, sorry
11/17/19, 12:13 PM - Caleb: What are you up to?
11/17/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs a success
11/17/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: Sounds very good
11/17/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt had a fried egg in forever
11/17/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre on the bus back to the airport
11/17/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna probably bus nap soon
11/17/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a short bus ride
11/17/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: Also!
11/17/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: Send the new album for the week when you get a chance
11/17/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: Oh wow
11/17/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: Short weekend
11/17/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: So how was your weekend?
11/17/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: And okay! I think I've got it picked out, but I'll send it when I'm sure
11/17/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/17/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs your fun marianna photo of the day
11/17/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Business on top leaving work in a skirt suit and casual on bottom with the timb boots before I got hunter rain boots last summer
11/17/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Weekend was good!
11/17/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send photos when I get home
11/17/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: We honestly mostly just hung out in coffee shops and talked
11/17/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: Like we went place to place just chatting
11/17/19, 1:18 PM - Marianna: And we saw the big main thing to see in Milan
11/17/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôd call it a success but I‚Äôd want to go back to see more of the city and have more than 24 hours there
11/17/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: But yes
11/17/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Very short
11/17/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: How was your weekend?
11/17/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: It feels like we barely got to talk yesterday (sorry)
11/17/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: But I still want to hear about it!
11/17/19, 1:37 PM - Caleb: First off, absolutely adorable
11/17/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: Nothing starts the day right like a Timb-wearing-yet-business-casual Marianna
11/17/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: And hey, don't worry about it
11/17/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: You only had Betsy and Marion for like two days, I don't want to distract you from them
11/17/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: And my weekend was okay
11/17/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: Pretty unproductive, yesterday I just kinda bummed around
11/17/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: Did some homework, and now I'm finishing stuff
11/17/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a great photo
11/17/19, 2:12 PM - Marianna: I miss Danielle who‚Äôs the one that took it. I got to work with her this summer too because she just happened to be assigned to the same office as me after she graduated!
11/17/19, 2:13 PM - Marianna: Yeah I know I‚Äôm gonna not be productive when I get home but I really need to be
11/17/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: On the plane now!
11/17/19, 2:16 PM - Caleb: H√§r √§r en l√•t till dig¬†‚Ä¶ Svefn-g-englar av Sigur R√≥s
https://open.spotify.com/track/07eGxuz8bL6QMsRqEe1Adu?si=7qdxwIXHS12Y71Yf-NcA4Q
11/17/19, 2:16 PM - Caleb: Here's an album
11/17/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: Idk if it'll be the one I pick for this week because it's a bit odd, but it used to be one of my favorites
11/17/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Also let me know when you land! Have a good flight
11/17/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: Oh right Swedish music!  Yay!
11/17/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: And will do
11/17/19, 2:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll sleep on this flight
11/17/19, 2:23 PM - Marianna: Also it‚Äôs been so rainy today my hair is absolutely a wreck like it‚Äôs gotten wet and then dried so many times
11/17/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: Nope! Icelandic
11/17/19, 2:26 PM - Caleb: Wait so does that mean your hair is super curly?
11/17/19, 3:53 PM - Marianna: Natalie Cook by Jessie Shelton
https://open.spotify.com/track/5aC68G4syIbrZTrY4oAZwK?si=KqI-EOsBR4mfcdp0ThyNRw
11/17/19, 3:53 PM - Marianna: Oh a country that‚Äôs you know up there north of everything
11/17/19, 3:54 PM - Marianna: Okay this song‚Äîmentions Viking burning at funerals so made me think of you and your paper. It‚Äôs from the podcast music 36 questions which we need to have a date to listen to the musical and then also do the 36 questions
11/17/19, 3:54 PM - Marianna: Landed!
11/17/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: And no more frizzy like it just gets gross if it gets wet but I don‚Äôt shampoo or condition it like in a shower
11/17/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Welcome back!
11/17/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: I like the song a lot
11/17/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Yeah we'll definitely have to have that date next semester, that sounds super fun
11/17/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: I mean it's close enough we could honestly schedule it right now hahaha
11/17/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: And aw that sucks
11/17/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Shows how much I know about curly hair
11/17/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs such a fun podcast. That‚Äôs one of my favorites.
11/17/19, 4:16 PM - Marianna: Idk I still feel like we don‚Äôt even know our schedules for sure for next semester yet
11/17/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: At least for me, I still need to figure out my tour time/admission followship times maybe, maybe cs tutoring hours, mock trial meeting times, and stuff like that
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: My brain is also still like very in this semester
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: Hey hey its okay
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: No stress
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Caleb: I was just saying it's in the near enough future we theoretically could
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: This weekend still made me want next semester so badly but also on the flight home I was looking at Budapest photos and wow I can‚Äôt imagine leaving these people and this place and not knowing when I‚Äôll see them or budapest again
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/17/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: Yes it is
11/17/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Which I am for sure glad about
11/17/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh, wait a second
11/17/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: I think it'll be longer between seeing you from Budapest to Brussels than now to Davidson
11/17/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah?
11/17/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: I think so
11/17/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: And hopefully once or twice between Brussels and davidson too
11/17/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Last leg of the race
11/17/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Or whatever the metaphor is
11/17/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Ha we get to ease into it
11/17/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Going from months without seeing each other, to like 3 weeks, and then maybe two more weeks if I catch you on the way to SC, then back to Davidson a week later
11/17/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Also am I allowed to be seeing these questions ahead of time
11/17/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: More like ease _out_ of it
11/17/19, 4:27 PM - Marianna: You know
11/17/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: Because we did say we were gonna be exclusively long distance
11/17/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: Ah right right
11/17/19, 4:28 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôve never seen a list of them but they talk about them in the musical but idk if they‚Äôre the exact same
11/17/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: I'll give you a firm handshake when we get back to Davidson
11/17/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: Without too much eye contact of course
11/17/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: No
11/17/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
11/17/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm going to request more
11/17/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: Screw easing out of long distance in my opinion
11/17/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Next semester will be fun
11/17/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Just got back and I‚Äôm gonna hard nap before I do anything I‚Äôm supposed to do this weekend
11/17/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Oooohhhh yeah
11/17/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: Tons of fun
11/17/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: I'm already looking forward to the "welcome back" parties on the first weekend
11/17/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: And good luck! Welcome back and have a good nap
11/17/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Wish I could join you
11/17/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh
11/17/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: We're talking about precision medicine in med ethics tomorrow
11/17/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: I'm SO EXCITED
11/17/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: This is exactly my field, I wonder if it's gonna feel like I'm an expert witness or something
11/17/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: Oh boy I'm so so excited
11/17/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: Caleb? Going to f? Does rlo know about this?!?!
11/17/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: It was an awful nap
11/17/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: But YAY about medical ethics!!!
11/17/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: I need to go find dinner
11/17/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: Pssh
11/17/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: I'll go to f if someone drags me there
11/17/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: (hint hint)
11/17/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Oh!
11/17/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: I can drag you there!
11/17/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: I feel like I don‚Äôt want to be productive at all tonight
11/17/19, 7:15 PM - Marianna: I think my fall break breaking my routine and then now looking forward to next semester just totally ruined my work ethic it‚Äôs awful
11/17/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: It's okay
11/17/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Winter will correct it
11/17/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: It'll be different when we get back and have actual work and are on campus
11/17/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Hopefully
11/17/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: I have my passion project(s) for winter break already planned
11/17/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Yeah but I‚Äôm also worried that like I don‚Äôt like studying alone in my room and sarah doesn‚Äôt usually study in the room so that will be interesting
11/17/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: But it will be fine
11/17/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: I can work in wall and union sometimes too
11/17/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: And Elena and Phelps will be next door so maybe I could work with them
11/17/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: And of course you‚Äôre always welcome
11/17/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Love me some study dates even if we just sit there in silence and work on our own work
11/17/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
11/17/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Nothing more romantic than going "why isn't this working WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING"
11/17/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Or we can make it candlelit and ruin our eyesight trying to do work in the dark
11/17/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: Jokes aside, I'm looking forward to it :)
11/17/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Hey I would argue it‚Äôs better to yell at your computer like that when someone else is there to be like yo you good?  The computer can‚Äôt hear you?
11/17/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: But ah yes
11/17/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Candles
11/17/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: For sure
11/17/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Rlo would love it
11/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: I am RLO!
11/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: It'd be delightful!
11/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: We can get those fake electric candles from Target
11/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: And target in itself could be a date
11/17/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: It's dates all the way down
11/17/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: You!
11/17/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Are!
11/17/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Rlo!
11/17/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: Oh!
11/17/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: No!
11/17/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: And yes to target
11/17/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I mean my room at least is gonna be decked out in fairy lights I hope
11/17/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhh what's that supposed to mean
11/17/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I swear I'm a good RLO dude
11/17/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I promise
11/17/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: And yeah, I'm excited to be able to have decorations in my room again
11/17/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: I'm also hoping to hit up goodwill for some interesting art
11/17/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: It's basically tradition at this point
11/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs such a cool idea for decoration
11/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm literally going to be printing like 200-300 more photos to put up on my wall
11/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna need so much tape
11/17/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: üò∞
11/17/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: Well uh good luck with taking those down
11/17/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: It's been real
11/17/19, 9:13 PM - Caleb: üëã
11/17/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: Nooooooo
11/17/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: Please
11/17/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt make you take them down this year?
11/17/19, 9:20 PM - Marianna: Will that make you happy?
11/17/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: Ahaha I'm totally kidding
11/17/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: I'll gladly use that as an excuse to hang out with you
11/17/19, 9:24 PM - Caleb: It worked out pretty well last time
11/17/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Hey how was your day
11/17/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: How are ya
11/17/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm trying to do crypto extra credit and I feel dumb
11/17/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: My brains just not in it
11/17/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: Come on BRIAN
11/17/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: so not great
11/17/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm gonna head to bed early today
11/17/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: Oh!  In Milan I bought some cool Christmas cards and they were playing Christmas music and that was honestly so nice to hear
11/17/19, 9:37 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd say highlight of my day
11/17/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: Me too
11/17/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: The bed early thing
11/17/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: It's just uneventful and I know I'm not gonna get anything done
11/17/19, 10:02 PM - Caleb: So might as well pass out
11/17/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Also BRIAN! HE'S BACK!
11/17/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: That's fun though
11/17/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Love me some Christmas spirit
11/17/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna give up on this crypto stuff
11/17/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just fruitless
11/17/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: So imma take a nice shower
11/17/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Care to join?
11/17/19, 10:09 PM - Marianna: Kidding

11/17/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: Hah
11/17/19, 10:16 PM - Marianna: How the tables have turned
11/17/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: How the turns have tabled
11/17/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: I'm sure I can convince you somehow
11/17/19, 10:16 PM - Caleb: May involve tickling
11/17/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Be warned
11/17/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: No
11/17/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Please no
11/17/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: No tickling
11/17/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Oh?
11/17/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Looks like I need another way to convince you
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: In all reality that‚Äôs how you end up with your two front teeth kicked out from my knee jerk reaction
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Or maybe you can try to convince me
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: HAHahaaa
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Marianna: Not a safe plan
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: I mean I'm a quarter of the way there already
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: #falsehalftooth
11/17/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: And sounds like a challenge to me
11/17/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Haha
11/17/19, 10:19 PM - Marianna: Woah

11/17/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: Kiddiiiing
11/17/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Sam Davis just popped up in my quick add for snapchat would it be weird if I added him as a friend
11/17/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: Nah that'd be fine
11/17/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: You already have Calvin
11/17/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: Go ahead
11/17/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: Be a party node
11/17/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: Sarah would love you for making that reference
11/17/19, 10:23 PM - Caleb: And I'm pretty sure my biggest issue in second grade was actually the big burn I had on my face
11/17/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: We analyze what kind of nodes people are all the time
11/17/19, 10:23 PM - Marianna: What?
11/17/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: That and the having the newest magic tree house book and overpromising on letting my friends borrow it
11/17/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Oo oo what node am I
11/17/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: I wonder where all my magic tree house books are
11/17/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs another thing we bonded over early on
11/17/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: And idk
11/17/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: I am actually not on networks
11/17/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: I just hear all the terms flying around
11/17/19, 10:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll ask sarah
11/17/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: Oh lordy yes
11/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Mary Pope Osborne was my gal
11/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Dinosaurs before Dawn?
11/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: AMAZING
11/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: I actually only have some of my original ones as a kid
11/17/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: My basement flooded years ago and we had to get rid of a ton
11/17/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Also the burn story involves is a marshmallow-based incident
11/17/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: It's a good one, ask me about it some time
11/17/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: I gotta keep _some_ mystery üòò
11/17/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember many of the titles I‚Äôm impressed
11/17/19, 10:40 PM - Marianna: We keep adding bookshelves to the hallway upstairs so I‚Äôm gonna bet they‚Äôre there because I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre on the bookshelf in my room anymore
11/17/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: My bookshelf is also overflowing but I love the look of it so full like that
11/17/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: and okay it sounds good but I can wait
11/17/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll let you keep this one _for now_
11/17/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Ahhh
11/17/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: One day I want a room in my house with an old leather chair and bookshelves surrounding it that are absolutely FILLED
11/17/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: And it'll have a cozy reading nook next to a big window that looks out on some trees
11/17/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: It'll be magical
11/17/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: And I'll sit there and drink hot chocolate with my dog on snowy winter days
11/17/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Well my dog won't be drinking chocolate
11/17/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Because, you know, the whole dogs and chocolates thing
11/17/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I always wanted a giant window with a window sill bench with cushions to read in
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Or a little reading nook built into shelves
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: I have a specific look of it in mind I‚Äôll see if I can find a picture like it sometime
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: and yeah
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt give dogs chocolate
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: I used to have a reading nook kinda like that
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: I do know that much about dog care
11/17/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: I used to sit there in the summer and have the window open
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: And it'd always smell like fresh rain on cut grass
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: My parents joke I‚Äôm a cat because they‚Äôd just find me reading on floors or couches but only in the spot where the sun was shining so it was all warm
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôd just move about the house as the sun moved
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: I USED TO DO THAT TOO!
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: You like the smell of cut grass?!?!
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: I'd just lay in the middle of the floor and do homework
11/17/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah, LOVE it
11/17/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Especially if it rains right after
11/17/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: And also rain on hot concrete
11/17/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: I hate that smeel
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: Mostly because I can smell it for 5 minutes and then nothing for 5 days
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: #allergies
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not dying over here I‚Äôm just not living
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: I like the smell of the rain though
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Aw I'm sorry
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: That doesn‚Äôt bother me
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: But yes
11/17/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Ah well at least we can agree on that one
11/17/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I swear one of the only reasons I can do a pretty deep cobra in yoga is because of reading and doing homework on the floor and strentching my back to be able to move like that
11/17/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Anyway
11/17/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna stick the album on and try to head to bed
11/17/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: I say that like I‚Äôm literally putting a record on a player
11/17/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not
11/17/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: But goodnight!

11/18/19, 8:13 AM - Caleb: Also I'm proud of your multi lingual autocorrect

11/18/19, 8:13 AM - Marianna: Neved is

11/18/19, 8:14 AM - Marianna: Ain‚Äôt I cool
11/18/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm on a new train this morning on the HEV Which is the one that looks straight out of the Cold War
11/18/19, 8:19 AM - Marianna: So their train doesn‚Äôt look straight out of the Cold War
11/18/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: So wait is it a new train to you
11/18/19, 8:34 AM - Caleb: Or was it made recently
11/18/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: Made recently
11/18/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: I mean idk if I‚Äôve been on that exact train car before
11/18/19, 8:49 AM - Marianna: But they look modern
11/18/19, 8:50 AM - Marianna: And its rare that I ride in the modern trains soooo
11/18/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: Sooooo probably no protection for nuclear fallout?
11/18/19, 9:19 AM - Caleb: That's a shame
11/18/19, 10:02 AM - Marianna: Tbh not sure the old ones have that either
11/18/19, 10:02 AM - Marianna: It is Hungary
11/18/19, 10:03 AM - Marianna: The m3 is a bomb shelter but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for nuclear bombs
11/18/19, 10:45 AM - Caleb: Ah I'm hitting the delimma if I want to work out this morning
11/18/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: I vote sleep
11/18/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: But also if you‚Äôre feeling like it working out will probably feel better than sleep
11/18/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Nope already heading to gym
11/18/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Okay
11/18/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: You
11/18/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Good job

11/18/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: WHy Is My BRaIn SO Not iNTO SChOOl RiGht NOW
11/18/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Because it wants to be done for the semester
11/18/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: That's my theory
11/18/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: It's on the home stretch
11/18/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: I think it's the intern stuff that did it to you
11/18/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: Yes it does
11/18/19, 11:32 AM - Marianna: And yeah that kind of makes sense
11/18/19, 11:33 AM - Marianna: Although it needs to remember it doesn‚Äôt actually have an internship yet so it needs to keep up!
11/18/19, 11:34 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm soooooo tired and I have sooooo much to do
11/18/19, 11:37 AM - Caleb: My motivation has absolutely dropped off a cliff too
11/18/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: I've watched so much Brooklyn nine-nine in the last week
11/18/19, 11:38 AM - Caleb: And I really really need to do work
11/18/19, 11:42 AM - Caleb: Oo oo oo

11/18/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: Okay I will listen when I get home
11/18/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: Sorry
11/18/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: (kidding)
11/18/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: :(
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: However, from this song I have 0 idea of the plot
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: And I now know I really really like the music
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Yeah the songs don‚Äôt make it super clear
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Right now I'm listening to a better version
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Gotta listen to the whole thing
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: ... I should probably stop shouldn't I
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Even then the plots a little confusing
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Are you listening to 36 questions?!
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: No!
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Wait for me!
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Okay okay!
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: Let me just finish thing song
11/18/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: Please?
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt have to wait
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: But I think it‚Äôs be fun
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Oh I'll totally wait
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: I just really like this song
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Plus then you can have a live performance of me singing them all and you being so lost and your ears bleeding
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: DEAL
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember that one
11/18/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: It's end of act 2
11/18/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Also I still need to cash in on you and I reinacting Les Mis
11/18/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: You and me* oh my gosh my dad would be so disappointed
11/18/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: No the truth is the last song in the whole thing!
11/18/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: I think
11/18/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Act 3 is my last favorite but I looked at it and it‚Äôs true
11/18/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Least**
11/18/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: And okay I can do that
11/18/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: I was listening to les mis on shuffle in the shower yesterday and it was confusing but so fun
11/18/19, 11:57 AM - Marianna: Poor sarah had to hear me screaming along to fantines arrest
11/18/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Well the song was called "A Better Version"
11/18/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: And basically all I know is that it ends happily
11/18/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: I think
11/18/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: I definitely know that it might end happily
11/18/19, 12:10 PM - Caleb: Also, Fantine's arrest? good choice
11/18/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: I'm always partial to "stars"
11/18/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: Javerts suicide is also a great song
11/18/19, 12:11 PM - Caleb: OH and ABC Cafe
11/18/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: Also I have a sitrep from Reid, Emma and Caroline's weekend in Budapest
11/18/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: They went to Simple, Instant (but only the main room), Fisherman's Bastion, and Buda Castle
11/18/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Not bad for like two days
11/18/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Oh and they took a taxi instead of of the 100E, but hey their choice
11/18/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: üò≥ü•∫
11/18/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not gonna spoil the ending
11/18/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Stars is the least vocally dynamic I feel like
11/18/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good
11/18/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: But not my favorite to sing
11/18/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Yay!  How‚Äôd they like it all!
11/18/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: And yeah the taxi works too but $3 bus vs not $3 taxi?  Although if they all shared and split it it couldn‚Äôt be much
11/18/19, 12:30 PM - Marianna: REMIND ME TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOBILE DEVELOPMENT MEME FROM TODAY
11/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: O-okay
11/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: Will do
11/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: And they really liked it! They also apparently did the baths, which I'm kinda bummed I didn't get around to doing
11/18/19, 12:32 PM - Caleb: But hey I guess I just need to go back some day
11/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: I think it would be fun to do a Danube cruise sometime, it's what Calvin's grandpa did
11/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: Good ol' grandpa Barrett
11/18/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt do the baths
11/18/19, 12:33 PM - Caleb: OH I might be going up to the cabin this winter!
11/18/19, 12:33 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt know how cool they were and they were so expensive so I was like we would have had to commit a good chunk of time to them
11/18/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: I definitely plan to come back heresy
11/18/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: Here**
11/18/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: Nonna‚Äôs best friend on Hilton Head went on a Danube cruise and loved it
11/18/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: And yay about the cabin!
11/18/19, 12:34 PM - Marianna: Is it just perpetually snowy up there during the winter?
11/18/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/18/19, 12:35 PM - Caleb: I'm not too upset by the baths because in my opinion I had a unique Budapest experience
11/18/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: I did lots of things that people wouldn't even dream of, and the baths just give me an excuse to go back
11/18/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: And yep! Usually it's absolutely beautiful starting in December
11/18/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: The Poconos are huge for skiing
11/18/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: And now I'm 21 so I can drink super nice wine with Calvin's grandpa because apparently no one else wants to
11/18/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: And also his grandparents are just delightful
11/18/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: I swear I don't just use them for their expensive alcohol
11/18/19, 12:39 PM - Caleb: If that's what I've been doing, I've been doing a real awful job
11/18/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: I thought we did pretty typical touristy things in Budapest
11/18/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Maybe not the hiking just because you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know about it if you just came for a weekend
11/18/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Do you ski?
11/18/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: I believe you‚Äôre not just using them
11/18/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs good to have multiple families
11/18/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: You know what I mean?
11/18/19, 12:55 PM - Marianna: Like family friends and friends families that act like you‚Äôre in the clan
11/18/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Psssh
11/18/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: No
11/18/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Underground tunnels of Instant?
11/18/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Nighttime tour of everything?
11/18/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Local pregame with lots of palinka?
11/18/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: Children's Railroad?
11/18/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Wine in the park with a hot date?
11/18/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: I could go on
11/18/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: I'm curious, do you think I ski?
11/18/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: And yeah I know exactly what you mean
11/18/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Calvin's family is that for me
11/18/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Every time I see them, his mom kisses me on the cheek and gives me a big hug
11/18/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: His grandparents apparently ask if I want to go to the cabin every time I'm home for break
11/18/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: And also Sam's parents are like that
11/18/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: I know all the family gossip
11/18/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: His mom always feeds me when I'm over and talks about all sorts of stuff
11/18/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: I've gone to his house before while he was still asleep and just hung out with his parents
11/18/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Well we found the tunnels the first time we went
11/18/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: I feel like tourists can do that by themselves
11/18/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: The other yeah maybe not so much
11/18/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you had a good time
11/18/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs odd I didn‚Äôt think we did all that much because it all so normal for me I guess
11/18/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: And no I think you have skied but I don‚Äôt think you do it normally?
11/18/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs great
11/18/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs how graces family was for me
11/18/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt seen them as much as of late of course
11/18/19, 3:25 PM - Caleb: I mean honestly in the beginning it was just a setup for you to be like "oh? What did you do that tourists didn't?" and then I could be like "would it be inappropriate to say you", but honestly I feel like Budapest was genuinely such a unique and fun experience because you were there with me
11/18/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Not only because you could show me cool things to do and make me feel marginally more local, but also because you're so much fun to travel and do fun things with
11/18/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: And nope! Never been skiing in my life
11/18/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: I've snowboarded though
11/18/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: And aw, that's sorta sad you haven't seen them recently
11/18/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: You think you'll see them when you go home?
11/18/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/18/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: Sorry I boggled that for you
11/18/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: I like kind of saw thats where it could go but I was like nah
11/18/19, 4:02 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm glad I made you feel like a local
11/18/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird whenever I‚Äôve I‚Äôm touristy cities I almost never feel like a tourist
11/18/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: Well I guess this semester I did sometimes
11/18/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: But i read a lot about cities and what to do in them before I visit so I feel kind of prepared and able to find the more local vibes
11/18/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you like traveling with me I liked traveling with you too
11/18/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: Okay what about me‚Äîam I the ski or snowboard type?
11/18/19, 4:04 PM - Marianna: And hopefully!
11/18/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: This past semester was the only semester I didn‚Äôt get breakfast with grace the day before or the day I left for DAVIDSON
11/18/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Partially because I wasn‚Äôt going to davidson
11/18/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: Partially because I was in philly
11/18/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Did someone say BOGGLE
11/18/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: And I'd take you for an infrequent skiier
11/18/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: But idk if you've ever gone
11/18/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: I'd lean to no actually
11/18/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: And oof, sorry I robbed you of grace
11/18/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Hey thanks for coming up though, it was fun having you
11/18/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Oh no not boggle
11/18/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Nope never skied or anything
11/18/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay I saw her a few times because her gf lives in mary Elizabeth‚Äôs building over the summer
11/18/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: Out of class!
11/18/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: Freeeeee!
11/18/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: Also you're gonna be so mad but I just realized all I had today was 3 eggs and a banana
11/18/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: For some reason I'm not hungry though
11/18/19, 5:47 PM - Caleb: How was your day?
11/18/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: Yaaaaaay!
11/18/19, 6:21 PM - Marianna: And no that‚Äôs bad

11/18/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: Ahhh
11/18/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: The importance of commas
11/18/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Whatcha eating?
11/18/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Also, ever sense you edited my essay I've actually been paying attention to how I use commas
11/18/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: You'd be so proud
11/18/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/18/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: So important
11/18/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: We got pad Thai last night
11/18/19, 6:24 PM - Marianna: And goooooood!!!
11/18/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Got a lot of work tonight?
11/18/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Also oooo pad Thai sounds good
11/18/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll just go get food out
11/18/19, 6:42 PM - Caleb: I'm kinda feeling lazy

11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Don't tell me Amazon
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: Vanguard
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Vanguard
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Ahhh
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Still awesome
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: So what questions do you have for them
11/18/19, 6:48 PM - Marianna: I hope it will go well
11/18/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah me too
11/18/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: What a typical day looks like in terms of projects for interns
11/18/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: And how much coding/what languages an intern would be able to aid in
11/18/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: And if the position is in Charlotte or Pennsylvania
11/18/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: Awesome
11/18/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: Seems like you've really been thinking about this
11/18/19, 6:50 PM - Caleb: Is it one of your top choices?
11/18/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Currently my only choice
11/18/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Southwest is still top but they haven‚Äôt contacted me
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: Amazon would be legendary
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Well
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Best of luck man
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Not sure what to say
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: You're super personable, I feel like you'd interview well
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: But this program seems like I‚Äôd learn and I‚Äôd not be too far from home either way and would maybe have friends in either place
11/18/19, 6:51 PM - Marianna: I think I do too
11/18/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: I need to still research what vanguard does
11/18/19, 6:52 PM - Marianna: Like I have a vague idea
11/18/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: So wait is the PA one in Paoli?
11/18/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Yeah that sounds like something important
11/18/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: Interviewers love it when you get super specific about what interests you about a place
11/18/19, 6:52 PM - Caleb: You already know that though
11/18/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: Holy shit hang on have you heard what's going on at Davidson
11/18/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: A visiting faculty is getting arrested
11/18/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: It was bovino
11/18/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: Did you have him?
11/18/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: No it started with an m
11/18/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: What's your source on that?
11/18/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Maggies friend showed up to his class this morning and was told he was fired and his davidson info page is gone
11/18/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Well
11/18/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: Guess I'm not getting analytical with him then
11/18/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: That's wild
11/18/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: Was he also orgo 2?
11/18/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Sam said it was gonna suck for kids trying to take orgo 2
11/18/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Wair
11/18/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Oh fuck that's me
11/18/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Ohfuckohfuck
11/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: What the heck
11/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Davidson is getting sketchy
11/18/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Low key
11/18/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: High key
11/18/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: Well I have no idea what to do
11/18/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt think you do anything
11/18/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: They either will let you know you can‚Äôt take the class or they are gonna find someone to teach it next semester
11/18/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: "hi sorry I can't graduate on time my professor got fired and arrested"
11/18/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: Well, fired and arrested for online activity sounds hella sketch
11/18/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: Oh no
11/18/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: They kept it vague
11/18/19, 7:09 PM - Caleb: That basically means CP or credit card fraud doesn't it
11/18/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: He was always just arrested not convicted
11/18/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: No there are other things
11/18/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: Well he did teach Orgo II how to make meth last year
11/18/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Synthetic chem ‚Äî> drugs‚Äî> sold on black market would be internet crimes
11/18/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: But ‚Äútask force‚Äù is vague
11/18/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: SC arrest records haven't updated yet
11/18/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Well this is gonna be an interesting couple days
11/18/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Dude I gotta not research this real quick
11/18/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah you have bigger issues right now don't you
11/18/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Concerns
11/18/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Not issues
11/18/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Better things to do
11/18/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/18/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: How are you feeling?
11/18/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Nervous
11/18/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs to be expected
11/18/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: I like this company though
11/18/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: It seems like a good mission
11/18/19, 7:24 PM - Marianna: Like it‚Äôs not for rich people it‚Äôs to help everyone no matter how much money you want to initially invest
11/18/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: But definitely nervous
11/18/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: I just hope i don‚Äôt talk too much
11/18/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Or I don‚Äôt get hit with a question that stumps me
11/18/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Or idk if they‚Äôre gonna ask coding qs because I already did a coding assessment
11/18/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Just remember, it's totally okay to not know the answer to a question
11/18/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: I WaNt a Job
11/18/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: If you can reason through it, go for it, but it's good to know when to admit that you don't know
11/18/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: It's what med school interviewers actually look for
11/18/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Premeds are so neurotic and need to know and have an answer to everything, but that doesn't fly if you're a doc and making high steaks decisions
11/18/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Anyway
11/18/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I just wanna say
11/18/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: You're great and I fully believe in you and hope you get this job
11/18/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Well thank you
11/18/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/18/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: I just want to do my best
11/18/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: And hope they like my best
11/18/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Who wouldn't like your best
11/18/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: It's the best
11/18/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Well thanks
11/18/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: 3 min
11/18/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Ah
11/18/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: How was your day?
11/18/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Well besides the Bovino thing and realizing I have a paper do tomorrow and midnight, pretty darn good
11/18/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you after your interview!
11/18/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: Well I think she liked me
11/18/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: The questions were new ones that I hadn‚Äôt really done before
11/18/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs gonna reach out to me about visiting the vanguard campus when I get back to the us!
11/18/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: Uh oh on the paper
11/18/19, 8:32 PM - Caleb: WOAH HEY
11/18/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: That's awesome
11/18/19, 8:28 PM - Marianna: Oh and I threw in a mention that they call their employees the ‚Äúcrew‚Äù and she was like wow you know the lingo
11/18/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Woah there, pulling out all the stops
11/18/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: It was a ‚Äúim not a stalker but I read up in your company‚Äù comment
11/18/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: On**
11/18/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: Still wish I had been a little more concise and less ramble with my answers but they really weren‚Äôt things I‚Äôve gotten before so booo
11/18/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: 12/10 would hire
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: What were the types of questions?
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: She only asked 2 behavioral ones!
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Also I know we both have a bunch of things to do, but would you want to call for like 15 minutes?
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: She had other little small talk that I treated like interview questions
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Sure!
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Gotta be quickish
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Now good?
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/18/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Ha no worries I have like 600 words left
11/18/19, 9:45 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: You said artichokey and I said csokis if you missed that which means chocolatey
11/18/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Hi I miss you
11/18/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Can't wait to see you soon :)
11/18/19, 9:54 PM - Caleb: Also I heard you say something, thanks for the explanation
11/18/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: Just me talking about chocolate what else is new
11/18/19, 10:24 PM - Caleb: Not much but it sounds like we'll be going to the right place then
11/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: OH
11/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: YES
11/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: I FORGOT
11/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: I WAS CONFUSED FOR A MINUTE
11/18/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: And maybe I‚Äôll even share my bonbons with you this time
11/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Bonbons??? With me?!?!?!
11/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: Gee whiz
11/18/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: I'm blushing
11/18/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: You should be
11/18/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm talking bonbons in bed
11/18/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Not to be weird
11/18/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: But man I am so excited for the bonbons
11/18/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: I feel like half of the places I‚Äôve traveled to ive gone for food
11/18/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: And the other half I‚Äôve gone for people
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: You know what I had the urge to do
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Well it sounds like you might get bolth
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: ?
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Go to more basketball games next year
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: DO
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: IT
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: But odds are I‚Äôll find I‚Äôm too busy
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: But I may try
11/18/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: You get to brag your boyfriend plays cowbell in the band
11/18/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: But only if I end Liam and reclaim my rightful throne
11/18/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: In all seriousness though, they're super fun
11/18/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Highly recommend
11/18/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh everyone will want to talk to me
11/18/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôll be like woah your boyf is practically famous can we be your friend?  Can we SIT with you?
11/18/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Wow
11/18/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: There's sarcasm
11/18/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: And then there's THAT
11/18/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: But no sorry we might just be too cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/18/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/18/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm pretty able at sarcasm
11/18/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: FLuEnT iN sArCAsM
11/18/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Hey what was the highlight of your day
11/18/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: (Conversational at least)
11/18/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Probably med ethics
11/18/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: It was fun to be actually super knowledgeable about something we talked about in class
11/18/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: And also it kinda made me feel like I was doing something actually important because it's being talked about in other fields
11/18/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: What about you?
11/18/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Oooh right!  That was today!
11/18/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you get that feeling when talking about it
11/18/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a good sign
11/18/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Hmm
11/18/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/18/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Probably being in bed rn
11/18/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Or grocery shopping
11/18/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs always so satisfying and low key enjoyable for me
11/18/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: I bought maln√°k _√©s_ √°fony√°k!!!
11/18/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: And what's that?
11/18/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Oh another highlight! Going to the gym felt really good
11/18/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: I didn't expect it to start my day so well honedtly
11/18/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Also, another highlight because I'm cheesy but it's true
11/18/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Talking to you
11/18/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Always a good way to end the day
11/18/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Or start it
11/18/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Or really anytime
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: And with that, I'm gonna go to bed
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Raspberries and blueberries
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: And yes
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: That too
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: And ooh I‚Äôm glad gym felt good
11/18/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna do yoga tomorrow because my Monday class is at 8 so I had a conflict with my interview
11/18/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna go tomorrow
11/18/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: I think
11/18/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm in bed too
11/18/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: Goodnight
11/18/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre pretty cool mr cool pants keep it cool
11/19/19, 7:30 AM - Caleb: Good morning!
11/19/19, 7:31 AM - Caleb: Why is it that I toss and turn and can't fall asleep until like 1:30
11/19/19, 7:31 AM - Caleb: And then at 7:30 in the morning, my bed is most comfortable thing ever and I can barely get up
11/19/19, 7:31 AM - Caleb: What kind of cruel joke is this
11/19/19, 7:59 AM - Caleb: Also, how do you like the album? It's not as good at putting me to sleep as I remember
11/19/19, 7:59 AM - Caleb: Gets a little too dramatic in the middle
11/19/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: WAIT A SECOND THERE'S NO CLASS TODAY
11/19/19, 8:35 AM - Caleb: WHY AM I HERE
11/19/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Good morning!
11/19/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: Yeah I relate to all that
11/19/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: I think I got to bed before 1 am but I woke up at 7 and have just been tossing and turning except for 15 min ago when I fell asleep again
11/19/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: And I like it. Not as much as some of the ones we‚Äôve done in the past but it‚Äôs better than the iron and wine we had last week
11/19/19, 8:37 AM - Marianna: AND NO CLASS?!?! Like not class at dis today or just your class?
11/19/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: And did you go all the way into dis to figure that out?
11/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: Just my first class
11/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: I biked in and have been sitting for 20 minutes
11/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: I mean usually people are late but I was like come on guys
11/19/19, 8:38 AM - Caleb: And then I checked the schedule
11/19/19, 8:38 AM - Marianna: Wow nice
11/19/19, 8:39 AM - Marianna: Still a nice surprise even if you did bike all the way there
11/19/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: Yeah
11/19/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: Guess I've got a work period
11/19/19, 8:39 AM - Caleb: I just wish I didn't skip breakfast to make it
11/19/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: I'm gonna go to a caf√© and get a 10kr coffee and croissant
11/19/19, 8:40 AM - Caleb: Also this sounds super nerdy, but I thought of another highlight of my day yesterday
11/19/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: I switched to a new shell instead of bash, and then messed around with it, and I LOVE it
11/19/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the Shell?
11/19/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: I always used terminator at work
11/19/19, 8:44 AM - Marianna: Had fun colors
11/19/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: I kind of want to see if I can get it on my Mac
11/19/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: And yeah you get that coffee and croissant
11/19/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: Well it's not the window, it's the actual interface
11/19/19, 8:45 AM - Marianna: Treat yo self
11/19/19, 8:45 AM - Caleb: It's called zshell
11/19/19, 8:46 AM - Caleb: I'll show you next time I see you
11/19/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: Oooh
11/19/19, 8:54 AM - Marianna: But isn‚Äôt bash kind of integral for Linux
11/19/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: Or just the shell in general
11/19/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: I thought bash was one of the things that made it cool
11/19/19, 8:55 AM - Marianna: But yes i want to see this z she‚Äôll
11/19/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Eh not quite
11/19/19, 9:04 AM - Caleb: Basically terminator is a terminal, but zshell is a shell
11/19/19, 9:05 AM - Caleb: Linux just needs a shell, something to get it to Assembly eventually
11/19/19, 9:06 AM - Caleb: But you can swap out whatever that is, so zshell does most of the same things and has the same purpose, but it's just slso nice to use
11/19/19, 9:08 AM - Caleb: Like, tab completion with zshell isn't case sensitive, and other things like that
11/19/19, 9:09 AM - Caleb: I mean you took Comp Org so you actually probably know this better than I do
11/19/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: Oh my word this croissant is fresh and so delicious
11/19/19, 9:13 AM - Caleb: I'm not even mad i got up an hour and a half early now
11/19/19, 9:33 AM - Marianna: Ah got it
11/19/19, 9:33 AM - Marianna: so it‚Äôs almost like the os of the terminal?
11/19/19, 9:33 AM - Marianna: Like not literally but kind of metaphorically?
11/19/19, 9:34 AM - Marianna: And we just did assembly and logic and hardware pretty much in comp org. And a brief overview of what OS do in general but not how linux works really
11/19/19, 9:34 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm happy for ya
11/19/19, 9:34 AM - Marianna: I think I still would have opted sleep over croissant but to each their down
11/19/19, 9:34 AM - Marianna: Own
11/19/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Okey
11/19/19, 9:59 AM - Marianna: Some photos for ya

11/19/19, 10:02 AM - Caleb: Yeah that's a decent way to put it
11/19/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: Also every one of those pictures is fantastic
11/19/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: Class is starting but I'll look better later
11/19/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: Guess who‚Äôs done for the day!
11/19/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: (Well not counting homework and yoga and interview and homework)
11/19/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: But walking home now
11/19/19, 1:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm v hungry
11/19/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna guess you
11/19/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: Congrats
11/19/19, 1:03 PM - Caleb: I've got one more class and then BREAK!
11/19/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Well and an essay to finish but psshh
11/19/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: Pssshhhhhh
11/19/19, 1:04 PM - Marianna: Oh right break!!!
11/19/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: You all packed?  Did you manage to get a ticket on the same flights as your friends?
11/19/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm low key jealous I wish I could go on such a big trip with abroad people
11/19/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: I'm actually flying Thursday morning, so I've got a day to do laundry, pack, and generally bum around
11/19/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Like the biggest has been 4 people for me
11/19/19, 1:05 PM - Marianna: Oh you‚Äôre good then
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Yeah! I'm excited because we took over an entire penthouse basically
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: I was gonna say when exactly is this paper due?!
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so cool
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: And also I don't really care about hanging with a lot of the people
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: And I'm only traveling with Hannah
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: And the whole group is in one spot for the whole time
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: So there's no stress of getting an entire group to travel together
11/19/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: I expect pictures of the penthouse and of Greece itself
11/19/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: Oh don't worry
11/19/19, 1:07 PM - Caleb: You'll get pleeeeenty
11/19/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: If you‚Äôd be so kind
11/19/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Yay
11/19/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs this group of people get together to travel?
11/19/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: A lot of different flights in and out
11/19/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: And I have no obligation to make sure any of the get where they need to be going
11/19/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Quite fun
11/19/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: Sorry I meant howd **
11/19/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: Like why United everyone to go to Greece
11/19/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: Like is it all Copenhagen people?  Is it mostly one friend group with some people tagging along?
11/19/19, 1:25 PM - Marianna: And that‚Äôs kind of nice you only have to deal with yourself
11/19/19, 1:41 PM - Marianna: Ugh the cleaning lady is still here. I feel bad about complaining but I also it‚Äôs so inconvenient that the one day we‚Äôre not at school all day is the day she comes
11/19/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: It's all Copenhagen people
11/19/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: And it's like two friend groups
11/19/19, 1:46 PM - Caleb: Also on the bright side, you have no flatmates ringing you out for misunderstandings with cleaning
11/19/19, 2:00 PM - Marianna: Hey that‚Äôs true
11/19/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: But boy I‚Äôm gonna have to clean my room next year by myself
11/19/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Oof
11/19/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: I shed too much for that
11/19/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Note to self: no white sheets in my room
11/19/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: You're like a black lab, there'd be hair absolutely everywhere
11/19/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Also FREEEEEEish
11/19/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Ah yes but white sheets do make it easy to clean up the marianna hair
11/19/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: Sorry not to be gross
11/19/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: And yaaaaaay
11/19/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: I submitted my mobile hw
11/19/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Heyo congrats
11/19/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Also I don't totally get why people think hair is gross
11/19/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Like, we've all got it
11/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Most of us*
11/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: What's the big deal
11/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: Just vacuum or something
11/19/19, 3:16 PM - Caleb: It's not like you have a hair-borne illness
11/19/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Hardiharhar
11/19/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Heyo
11/19/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Miss you
11/19/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: wait
11/19/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Hairdihairhair**
11/19/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Hehe thank ya
11/19/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Also I miss you too champ
11/19/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: How was your day
11/19/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd what you‚Äôre welcome for but you‚Äôre welcome
11/19/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: It was good
11/19/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna take a nap for an hour
11/19/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: I did what I had planned to do by this time
11/19/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: And the rest of the day should be good too
11/19/19, 3:45 PM - Marianna: How was your day?
11/19/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Get that thicc nap
11/19/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: You've earned it
11/19/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: My day was pretty good! I realize I've been forgetting to eat a lot recently
11/19/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Idk why my appetite isn't really kicking in
11/19/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: However at like 3 I realized I didn't eat and got something
11/19/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: So all is well
11/19/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Class was fun
11/19/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: I probably shouldn't have biked in this morning, it was kinda freezing rain when I rode home
11/19/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: But honestly, still pretty good
11/19/19, 4:52 PM - Marianna: I want more nap
11/19/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Someone in our building is hammering something and it‚Äôs remarkably annoying
11/19/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: But booooooo having to bike in the freezing rain
11/19/19, 4:53 PM - Marianna: Booooo
11/19/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: Honestly it wasn't that bad
11/19/19, 4:59 PM - Caleb: Also hey how much work do you have tonight
11/19/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Not too much
11/19/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Like I have nothing due tomorrow but sarah and i are gonna start looking at theory hq
11/19/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Hw
11/19/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your paper going?
11/19/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Good, it's almost done!
11/19/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Sarahs been asleep for like 2 hours
11/19/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: I don't want to pull this on you because I swear I'm not using you for proofreading, but if you have time would you be able to look over it?
11/19/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: It's totally fine if you're busy
11/19/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: No harm in sending it over
11/19/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: I can try to look at it
11/19/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mind proofreading
11/19/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like debugging
11/19/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: But harder?
11/19/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Ehhhh
11/19/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I'd say easier
11/19/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: I definitely still make stupid mistakes though
11/19/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah but at least with debugging you know somethings wrong
11/19/19, 5:25 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs easier in that way but harder to find what‚Äôs wrong sometimes
11/19/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/19/19, 5:26 PM - Marianna: I like the analogy
11/19/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: Debug my writing pls
11/19/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: I'm wrapping up now, I'll send it in like 5 min?
11/19/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just getting to yoga so I won‚Äôt get to it for a while
11/19/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: But yeah that works
11/19/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: Ah, okay
11/19/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: What time do you think you'll be back?
11/19/19, 5:32 PM - Marianna: Probably 7:30ish
11/19/19, 5:32 PM - Marianna: Is it due tonight?
11/19/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah but it's literally done
11/19/19, 5:46 PM - Caleb: I just need to proofread and submit
11/19/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: Okay, shared it with you, let me know if/when you get a chance to look at it!
11/19/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: Let it be noted, him sleeping like that wasn't a phase
11/19/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Okay will do
11/19/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: And are you sure he‚Äôs not part possum or something f
11/19/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: I uh
11/19/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: I think he's not a possum
11/19/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Or an opossum for tf hat matter
11/19/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Ill get back to you on that though
11/19/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: How was yoga?
11/19/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: He just looks like he could be playing dead possum style
11/19/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt that a possum that does that
11/19/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: And eh it wasn‚Äôt my best practice
11/19/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Not bad but I wasn‚Äôt as balanced or flexible as usual but it‚Äôs normal for that to vary even with routine practice
11/19/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: Well
11/19/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: That's okay
11/19/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Apparently it's a girls night + Reid and they're watching a Christmas movie and killing a bottle of wine each
11/19/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: And I'm apparently invited too
11/19/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: So you can catch Tastefully Smashed Caleb later if you want
11/19/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Ooooooooh that sounds so fun
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: I would love some tastefully smashed Caleb
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Have you ever seen elf
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs a good caleb
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: No
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: Please tell me yo
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: YOU WJAT
11/19/19, 8:35 PM - Caleb: HOW
11/19/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: My parents think it has no intelligence value so
11/19/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: And plus what do you expect
11/19/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: We can‚Äôt watch the same movie
11/19/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: It would end the world
11/19/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: IT'S A CHRISTMAS MOVIE
11/19/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: NOT A VIDEO LECTURE SERIES
11/19/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: I think this is the first time that you've not seen a movie that is perfectly reasonable to expect someone to have watched
11/19/19, 8:47 PM - Caleb: Update I'm tispy enough to be incredibly sassy without thinking about it
11/19/19, 8:48 PM - Caleb: That's a mild issue
11/19/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
11/19/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôd like sassy Caleb
11/19/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve met him
11/19/19, 8:48 PM - Marianna: Have I?
11/19/19, 8:49 PM - Marianna: And yeah I need to watch it at some point
11/19/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: Call me crazy but I think we can work something out if you want
11/19/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: Before Christmas might not happen
11/19/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: But we can force the Christmas spirit in January
11/19/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Have a cute themed day on the first time it snows
11/19/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: Also you absolutely have not
11/19/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: I'll give you a preview:
11/19/19, 8:58 PM - Caleb: A little earlier, I was cooking in Hannah's flat because I wanted to hang out with them while eating
11/19/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: And so Hannah goes "hey make sure to clean up your dishes, I've had to clean up before"
11/19/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: To which I go "okay the last time I cooked in here was two months ago, and we had a deal that I cook and you clean"
11/19/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: And she goes "fine just clean up"
11/19/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: And so a few glasses of wine in, I'm done and cleaning, but the dishwasher is full of clean dishes
11/19/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: So I start emptying the dishwasher, and sqeak one of the dishes
11/19/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: And a bunch of people are over, and she goes "ahhh that hurt my ears", and I instantly turn around and go "oh I'm so sorry Hannah, I'll put away your dishes more quietly"
11/19/19, 9:01 PM - Caleb: And then everyone roasted her for like two minutes
11/19/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: Also
11/19/19, 9:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 9:03 PM - Caleb: Thanks for giving it a look by the way, I really appreciate it
11/19/19, 9:07 PM - Marianna: I only got a few pages in

11/19/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: Imagine the drama, I wonder who has me????
11/19/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Hey as long as it was good spirited and friendly and she didn‚Äôt seem too hurt I think it‚Äôs fine
11/19/19, 9:24 PM - Marianna: And yeah that sounds fun although not too secret

11/19/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: I'm really good
11/19/19, 10:21 PM - Caleb: And no probably not
11/19/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: There's the whole orthogonal drunk thing
11/19/19, 10:22 PM - Caleb: So no
11/19/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: I so greatly enjoy that we can say things like orthogonal drunk in our conversations and we GET IT
11/19/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: let‚Äôs be real science/math/nerdy pillow talk or just talk in general is the best
11/19/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: How can it be any other way
11/19/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: Hi
11/19/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm about to blow your drunk mind
11/19/19, 10:29 PM - Marianna: This is a friendly reminder you have a single next year
11/19/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I remember and I‚Äôm just like whaaaaaaat howd this get swung?  What rlo devil did you pay off? But I‚Äôm excited and it‚Äôs not even my room!!!  I‚Äôm like excited for you!  And that maybe then I‚Äôll get to hang out with you sometimes!
11/19/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhh I think you're exited for some other reasons here Mar
11/19/19, 10:32 PM - Caleb: And I'm excited too :)
11/19/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: And OH YES please
11/19/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Also my drunk typos have toned down
11/19/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Having a bigger keyboard did it I think
11/19/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Well yeah but idk I‚Äôm v looking forward to it
11/19/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: And yes
11/19/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: I would not guess you were drunk rn
11/19/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Will need drunk snaps to corroborate story
11/19/19, 10:38 PM - Marianna: Sorry about it
11/19/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Ah maggie also applied for the admissions fellowship
11/19/19, 10:39 PM - Marianna: Ahhhhhhh
11/19/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Does it stress you out to compete with friends
11/19/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: Kind of
11/19/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs more like I don‚Äôt like knowing who I‚Äôm competing against because I cope with the stress of the application process but thinking that I‚Äôm only competing against incompetence people because it‚Äôs easier to be confident like that but knowing a real person means the confidence at getting the job goes sooooo way down
11/19/19, 10:42 PM - Marianna: A girl wrote her entire why davidson about Maggie last year
11/19/19, 10:43 PM - Marianna: Like I really like competition when it‚Äôs friendly and whatever outcome isn‚Äôt a big deal but this is. Job competition stuff is
11/19/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: If one of us gets it and the other doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs gonna be an awkward spot for the next year and a half
11/19/19, 10:47 PM - Caleb: Hi welcome to me who's too scared to move on from their position because they have servere impostor syndrome and don't know how to cope with it
11/19/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: Thus they wish they had applied to positions outside their current organization so that they could feel a sense of belonging but also believes that it's the best thing they might get
11/19/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: And also he likes his job and it's a really amazing job but also holy shit how did I get here I don't belong here
11/19/19, 10:48 PM - Caleb: I don't deserve this
11/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: And I really really don't want to compete with you because I think I'll lose and don't want to deal with it either way
11/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Oh hi you're online
11/19/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Hi
11/19/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Nah you wouldn‚Äôt lose
11/19/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: Hi
11/19/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I am
11/19/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: And hey
11/19/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt think I had that from the last 2 years????
11/19/19, 10:50 PM - Marianna: I was 18 and got hired but a pretty intimidating employee _with a high school resume and transcript_ like what
11/19/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: And you wouldn‚Äôt be competing with me
11/19/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: And there‚Äôs no harm in putting apps out there even if you like what you got the worst they do is say no and lord knows I‚Äôve gotten a lot of nos
11/19/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: But you say well screw them
11/19/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm also a really bit believer in stuff happens for a reason
11/19/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: So even when I‚Äôm bummed about something I‚Äôm pretty much it wasn‚Äôt meant to be
11/19/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Like Barcelona
11/19/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm like whatever if I was supposed to get to Barcelona i would have managed to make it work but it just didn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs fine
11/19/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: It can‚Äôt affect my storyline too much you know
11/19/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: I have explained my fixed point life theory to you right?
11/19/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Yes you have
11/19/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: And I REALLY WANT talk talk to you more about it

11/19/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Okay we can talk more about it
11/19/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: I like my theory a lot
11/19/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: It has holes in it
11/19/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm only human
11/19/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: So deal with it
11/19/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: And aw I‚Äôm jealous

11/20/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: You deleted this message

11/20/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: I just woke up to hearing someone throwing up in the street
11/20/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm really not gonna miss my street next year
11/20/19, 12:34 AM - Marianna: But hey

11/20/19, 7:32 AM - Marianna: I hate Wednesday
11/20/19, 7:32 AM - Marianna: I am starting to hate having 9am classes 4/5 days a week
11/20/19, 9:38 AM - Caleb: Hi good morning
11/20/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: I can say with 100% certainty that I'm not listening to that voice message
11/20/19, 9:39 AM - Caleb: Also I'm sorry about the street thing
11/20/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: You'll be back at Davidson soon, WAY more quiet there
11/20/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: And it was a fun night that ended with a real heart to heart
11/20/19, 9:40 AM - Caleb: Gotta love those
11/20/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Voice memo isn‚Äôt so bad
11/20/19, 9:53 AM - Marianna: Although you said the one you deleted before it was much more embarrassing but I didn‚Äôt get to hear that one don‚Äôt worry because you deleted it
11/20/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: 52 days!
11/20/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: And yay!  I‚Äôm glad
11/20/19, 9:54 AM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your plan for today?
11/20/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: I'm pretty sure it was embarrassing because I just couldn't finish it
11/20/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Like I got side tracked every time
11/20/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: Well currently I'm in bed with a killer headache because I had a ton of $4 wine and awful vodka
11/20/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: But it's mostly a prep day
11/20/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: So laundry, cleaning, and packing
11/20/19, 10:08 AM - Caleb: I might go to Tivoli if I find people to go with
11/20/19, 10:10 AM - Caleb: What about you?
11/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Haha that‚Äôs fair
11/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: I get sidetracked when talking sober
11/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry about the headache
11/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd still take hungover in bed than at class rn
11/20/19, 10:55 AM - Marianna: Ooooh tivoli sounds fun though
11/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I wish we had an amusement park
11/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Like in Budapest
11/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I guess sarah and I still need to do the Budapest eye
11/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just gonna die
11/20/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs my plan today
11/20/19, 10:56 AM - Caleb: Hi yeah please don't do that
11/20/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Actually I‚Äôm gonna go to the early mobile so I can get home at 5 instead of 7 but that means I can‚Äôt work on theory with sarah until tonight
11/20/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Which sucks but I think I‚Äôd get too burnt out if I stay at school working until 6pm
11/20/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm already so burnt out
11/20/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Why did I decide to take 5 classes this semester
11/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Wait you had an option not to?
11/20/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Davidson, what the heck guys
11/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: And then hopefully wine night with maybe some homework and wine night
11/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: We just had to take more than 16 hrs of class
11/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: Recommended is 16-20
11/20/19, 10:58 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm at 22
11/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Ahhhh
11/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: I think mine was the same way actually
11/20/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: Course registration feels so long ago
11/20/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: Mine was only 3 months ago
11/20/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: It sometimes still hits me that I‚Äôve just been living in a foreign country for 3 months
11/20/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: But like this is a lot considering we take 12 hours of classes at DAVIDSON
11/20/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: Or more if you have labs
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: But not 22 hours a week
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: Wait a second
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Plus We‚Äôre commuting an hour each way
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: We only have 12 hours of class at Davidson?
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: What the heck
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: I guess it's just a lot of work
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: 3 hours a week
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: 4 classes
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: Do the math?
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: I might have done the math wrong
11/20/19, 11:02 AM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm pretty sure I didn‚Äôt
11/20/19, 11:03 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not THAT bad at mental math
11/20/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Nah I think you're right
11/20/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: That's crazy
11/20/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: Why does it feel like so much then
11/20/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: What happened to all my tkme
11/20/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Time*
11/20/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Oh boy sitting up does not feel good
11/20/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: Update I got up and showered, and now I feel surprisingly fine
11/20/19, 11:51 AM - Caleb: Also, I'm looking at PE classes, and I'm debating spin/yoga
11/20/19, 11:51 AM - Caleb: It looks like it fits in my schedule the best
11/20/19, 11:51 AM - Caleb: Anything MWF is not gonna happen
11/20/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: WHAT I THOUGHT SPIN YOGA WAS MONDAY
11/20/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Nope
11/20/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Tuesday at 3:15
11/20/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: ooooh
11/20/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I thought it was Monday
11/20/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Now I wanna take it
11/20/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: So basically my options are some form of yoga, fake kickboxing, and Tai chi
11/20/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: I think I was looking at the cycle and strength class that didn‚Äôt work
11/20/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: TAI CHI
11/20/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: And I've done tai chi and actual kickboxing for a whole
11/20/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: While*
11/20/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Although it‚Äôs 2 hours a week
11/20/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: So not ideal
11/20/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: So I don't want to do fake kickboxing, and tai chi is more just breathing
11/20/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Oh wait
11/20/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Tai chi prereq
11/20/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: You need prior experience
11/20/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: So I'm guessing the spin/yoga is what you were thinking of?
11/20/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah spring semester is for people who did it in fall semester
11/20/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: You learn the second half of the form in the spring
11/20/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: And I had looked at it but had counted it out because I thought it was Monday
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Wait a second that's right YOU DID TAI CHI!
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: But I need more cardio in my life
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: How could I forget
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's what I'm thinking
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I honestly may sign up for it and the other yoga class and maybe drop one but also maybe not
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: But also I'll be totally honest I don't want to cramp your style or anything
11/20/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Hey you found this class on your own
11/20/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd cramp my style
11/20/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not gonna make you not take something just because now I realize I want to take it
11/20/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Ok but it sounds like it's something you'd prefer to not have me there for
11/20/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Which is totally understandable
11/20/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Ah idk
11/20/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not like I wouldn‚Äôt want you there
11/20/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: But I like having my own things and time and places that I do things and idk if I‚Äôd be distracted if you were in the class
11/20/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: But I think it also might be really fun to have you there
11/20/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: Would you rather I not be there?
11/20/19, 12:04 PM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt be offended
11/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: No no no
11/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: I'm the exact same way
11/20/19, 12:05 PM - Caleb: Like, I think it would be fun
11/20/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: My only concern is you seeing how awful my cardio is
11/20/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: I did a spin class exactly once, and it was with my mom, and I may have almost passed out
11/20/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: But I'm the same way, I really like having my own things
11/20/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: Idk
11/20/19, 12:10 PM - Marianna: Okay I have to go to class we can talk in a little bit again if you‚Äôd like
11/20/19, 12:18 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's not worth stessing about
11/20/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: I'll sign up for it anyway because I think it's the thing I want to do the most
11/20/19, 12:19 PM - Caleb: And hey if it's truly awful we can just go to other ends of the studio haha
11/20/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/20/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: Okay hear me out
11/20/19, 12:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm thinking I sign up for both the spin and the normal class I want
11/20/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: After a week of the spin was weird and I like the normal yoga, ill drop spin because you did kind of find it first because I had the times wrong
11/20/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: But if we‚Äôre cool with it, we can both stay in spin
11/20/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: As long as we get spots in it
11/20/19, 12:36 PM - Marianna: If that‚Äôs cool with you
11/20/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: And as long as you promise not to smell me after the spin and yoga class
11/20/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Well
11/20/19, 12:37 PM - Marianna: It won‚Äôt be nice
11/20/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: AHAHA
11/20/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm sure I can promise that
11/20/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: I'm surprised how quick we got to the overthinkjng stage, but sure that sounds good
11/20/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: The overthinking stage?
11/20/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/20/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve honestly never had to deal with like boyfriends in classes
11/20/19, 12:42 PM - Marianna: All girls high school remember
11/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs just strange like idk what the protocol is here
11/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Like obviously people take classes with their relationship people
11/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/20/19, 12:43 PM - Marianna: Maybe that‚Äôs what you mean by overthinking
11/20/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also gonna be so wild like we never really crossed paths last semester but I‚Äôm very excited to cross paths with you as much as you can tolerate me üôÉ
11/20/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: Hey my paper got graded! 95!
11/20/19, 12:50 PM - Caleb: Yeah I really don't think there is a protocol here
11/20/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: We're just gonna have to feel it out, which is fine by me
11/20/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: No PRoToCOL wGaT I nEeD RulES in MY LiFe
11/20/19, 12:51 PM - Caleb: I can't tell if you're making fun at me or yourself
11/20/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Because yeah pretty much
11/20/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Me
11/20/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: That was me
11/20/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: And congrats!
11/20/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre welcome!
11/20/19, 12:54 PM - Caleb: I'm trying to ease up though, I feel like last semester turned me into a frantic, high-strung person
11/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Or compared to before
11/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: I don't think I'm that bad but still
11/20/19, 12:55 PM - Caleb: Also yes! Thank you!
11/20/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: And just so you know, I typed that text out and spent five minutes reading about if I'm using the comma between frantic and high-strung rigjt
11/20/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: And I AM
11/20/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: And now I know about the difference between coordinate and cumulative adjectives
11/20/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: I never thought I'd say this, but grammar is actually really interesting
11/20/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: Last semester made me less of a high strung person
11/20/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: Whooo
11/20/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Also apparently BETSY and sarah are planning on doing spin yoga
11/20/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: It might be hard to get into
11/20/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: They really should let people who need credit sign up first
11/20/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: Like betsy and I don‚Äôt üòÅ
11/20/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: Yeah no GOOD COMMA
11/20/19, 1:15 PM - Marianna: Grammar is interesting
11/20/19, 1:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah don't mind me I'm just trying to graduate
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: Always thought I could be an editor
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Caleb: Well
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Caleb: Good news
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Caleb: Ya still can be
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: No
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: Boooo
11/20/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt confuse me career wise
11/20/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: I mean
11/20/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: Keep in mind that's coming from me
11/20/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: It's like split personality disorder except just career-wise
11/20/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: Some days I'm like "know what, I'm gonna pull a McCandless and live in the woods"
11/20/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: And other days Im like hey, being a war correspondent would be SO amazing
11/20/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: Mccandless?
11/20/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: Oh right, you've never seen or read "Into the Wild" have you
11/20/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Is that theaurou
11/20/19, 1:22 PM - Marianna: Or however you spell it
11/20/19, 1:23 PM - Caleb: Nope, Thoreau was a poet who wrote about living in the woods and the philosophy of it
11/20/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: Chris McCandless is a dude who loved it and got fed up with society so he actually did it
11/20/19, 1:24 PM - Caleb: So basically
11/20/19, 1:25 PM - Caleb: Thoreau wrote "A Cabin in the Woods"
11/20/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: Oooooh got it
11/20/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: How ya doing mate
11/20/19, 1:31 PM - Caleb: ... Are you asking that because I just referenced going into the woods to live the rest of my days as a hermit, or is this an unrelated question
11/20/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: No
11/20/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Unrelated
11/20/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: Just my usual question
11/20/19, 1:39 PM - Marianna: I ask it a lot
11/20/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: I'm pretty good
11/20/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: Thanks for asking
11/20/19, 1:47 PM - Caleb: How are you?
11/20/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: My head hurts
11/20/19, 1:50 PM - Marianna: My stomach doesn‚Äôt feel great
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt felt like good for most of the semester
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôve been fine
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: But my stomach has just not been happy
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: I blame the sarah diet being imposed on me
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: My Sarahs fault
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: But her diets not great to be around
11/20/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Because it encourages me to just eat chocolate and meat and no veggies
11/20/19, 1:52 PM - Marianna: But im going to class that will be done at 4 and then I‚Äôm gonna go nap and then work on theory with her when she gets home
11/20/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's basically meat and carbs for her, isn't it
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry you don't feel well though
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Did you get the class?
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Yep!
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Bad it‚Äôs okay
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be fine
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Me too I got both of mine!
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Bah**
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: How do you know if you got it?
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Just to make sure
11/20/19, 2:01 PM - Marianna: Email confirmation
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: Awesome
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Yaaaaay
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Caleb: Yeah I signed up for it and then also the kickboxing thing
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs cool
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Maggie liked kickboxing last year
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Okay it‚Äôs class time
11/20/19, 2:02 PM - Marianna: Catch ya on the flip side
11/20/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: Yeah, my main concern is that it isn't contact and not competitive, so idk if it would be super fun
11/20/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: Wow both yoga! and spin yoga are full already
11/20/19, 2:03 PM - Caleb: I'll be totally honest I forgot about registration until like 2 minutes before it started
11/20/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: I just kinda looked at it and was like "wait isn't it 7:58 in the US"
11/20/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: So I'm amazed I got it
11/20/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: Yeah wow
11/20/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: Sarah and betsy didn‚Äôt
11/20/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs because sarah enrolled at 7:57am because it will let you
11/20/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs kind of her fault because she didn‚Äôt read the email that they invalidate those enrollments
11/20/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm still bummed
11/20/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: Aw :(
11/20/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: Also you scared the shit out of me because I thought I might have jumped the gun
11/20/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: But it's still there
11/20/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: So yay
11/20/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: Also I have the most precious pupdate I've ever seen
11/20/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 2:59 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Yeah no as long as you did it after 8am you‚Äôre good
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Hold up wait a second
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Uhhhhhhhh
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: HES SO SMALL
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Huhhhhh
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: uhhhh
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: I got some bad news for you potentially
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: It's still listed there
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see how long it is
11/20/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Did she get kicked from it right away?
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: No she didn‚Äôt
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: UHHH
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Well
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: We're gonna see how this goes
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: She had to unenroll and tried to reenroll and that took her too long to actually enroll
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: Well
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Marianna: If they don‚Äôt kick you out don‚Äôt tell her you did it early
11/20/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: Will do
11/20/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: Because I told her it wouldn‚Äôt take if she did it before 8 and so she scrambled
11/20/19, 3:03 PM - Marianna: Do you people not read emails?!
11/20/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: I'll be honest I wasn't paying attention to the time
11/20/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: And it said add and I was like "sure"
11/20/19, 3:03 PM - Caleb: And here we are
11/20/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: Ah
11/20/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/20/19, 3:04 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: Hey don't rub it in
11/20/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: Well we're gonna find out when I get an angry email from someone
11/20/19, 3:15 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/20/19, 3:15 PM - Marianna: Emails are important
11/20/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/20/19, 3:15 PM - Marianna: I hope you don‚Äôt get an angry email for what it‚Äôs worth
11/20/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: I'm aware
11/20/19, 3:15 PM - Caleb: Hitting me with a "SSEEE" was a little unnecessary though
11/20/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: Sorrrry
11/20/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: Done!
11/20/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna wait for the shuttle to start running in 14 minutes
11/20/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: I forgive you
11/20/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: Something will work out
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Hopefully you
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Haha
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: I'm actually eyeing a jiu jitsu class in Cornelius, so I might do that instead
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Get it
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: HA
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Noice
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Also
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: I've got a good story for you
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Hit me
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: With you
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Best
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Shot
11/20/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: So I decided to clean out my room a bit while I'm packing, and I set a timer for five minutes
11/20/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: ... Which turned out to be five hours
11/20/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: So about fifteen minutes in, I'm about done, and thinking it's a long five minutes
11/20/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: But anyway, in the beginning of the semester, I did something where I wrote a letter to myself and was going to open it midway through the semester
11/20/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: And I stumbled across it under my desk, unopened
11/20/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: So I pop it open and read it, and guess what I wrote in the first paragraph
11/20/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 4:29 PM - Marianna: Awwwwww hahaha
11/20/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you are
11/20/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a cool idea
11/20/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never like written a letter to open later
11/20/19, 4:30 PM - Marianna: Photos are more my thing to look back at and remember stories
11/20/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Or soemtimes I‚Äôll write out notes on my phone to think things through and almost argue with myself before making a decision
11/20/19, 4:31 PM - Marianna: Oh man I‚Äôm tired
11/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: You should take a nap and then work after that
11/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: Also I now realize how awful my handwriting is if I'm writing quickly
11/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: And in general too
11/20/19, 5:01 PM - Caleb: I'm amazed you read that
11/20/19, 6:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Mmmmm good morning
11/20/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: That handwriting looks more like a font
11/20/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: And woah is that one store????
11/20/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Yep
11/20/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: I've just kinda been wandering around Copenhagen for a few hours now and it's been GREAT
11/20/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: I've found so many beautiful things
11/20/19, 6:45 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 6:46 PM - Caleb: It's just down tiny, clean, festively decorated alleyway
11/20/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: So cool
11/20/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: Wow you‚Äôve been productive this evening
11/20/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: Josh and sarah are here
11/20/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: I told her to wake me and I didn‚Äôt kill her so I‚Äôd call that improvement
11/20/19, 6:50 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm gonna get up and do work
11/20/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Yeah it really had been
11/20/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Also I got a haircut and shopped for some basic stuff
11/20/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: Good luck with the work thing
11/20/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Ooooooh
11/20/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the hair cut?
11/20/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs the beard?  You cut it how long ago?
11/20/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Haircut is decent, beard is still here
11/20/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: It was earlier today, like 4 maybe?
11/20/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: No no the beard
11/20/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: You shaved the beard
11/20/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: How long ago was that
11/20/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: It was the last day of October
11/20/19, 8:06 PM - Marianna: Oh so beard is back in full now?

11/21/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: So it turns out I'm pulling the early Monday return after all

11/21/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: And there's a good story about the wines
11/21/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: We found a local wine store near our house
11/21/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: And we walked in, and I walk up to the old lady working, and go "hi! Could you recommend any local wines?"
11/21/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: And she looks at me, holds up one finger, and picks up the phone
11/21/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: And so we're just perusing the shelves, and she comes up to me with a phone and says "telephone", and I take it and have a conversation about wines with some Greek on the phone who helps us pick things out
11/21/19, 3:38 PM - Caleb: And here we are, drinking delicious cheap wine on our porch thanks to some Greek out there and a helpful lady
11/21/19, 3:40 PM - Marianna: Oh that is so cool

11/21/19, 6:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/21/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: Honestly I don't know if Copenhagen clicked with me as much as other cities could have
11/21/19, 6:44 PM - Caleb: I think it's the most livable barring the cost, but culture wise idk
11/21/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Well you end up where ya end up
11/21/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: It would have been interesting to see what it would have been like dynamic wise anywhere else
11/21/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/21/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: I think we all end up where we need to
11/21/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Or at least I'd like to believe that
11/21/19, 6:55 PM - Caleb: And honestly what you get out of it is what you make of it, not where you are
11/21/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Hi I miss you, I know I say it a lot but it's true
11/21/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: I agree

11/21/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: I absolutely love it though
11/21/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: And now I'm tipsy and playing and it's infinitely more fun
11/21/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Yes!

11/21/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Yeah I can definitely see how it‚Äôs been cool tipsy
11/21/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: We could turn it into a drinking game and it's a great way to get to know people
11/21/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Then I can get to know your friends
11/21/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Or vise versa
11/21/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Low key nervous about that
11/21/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs one of those creative games like cards against humanity

11/21/19, 8:05 PM - Marianna: I really do
11/21/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: I think so
11/21/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: But hey oh well

11/21/19, 8:09 PM - Caleb: So theres that
11/21/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Gotta admit though
11/21/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Jackbox is a great idea
11/21/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: We'll find some way to turn it into a drinking game
11/21/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: And hey even if they don‚Äôt like you I‚Äôll still like you
11/21/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôll like you
11/21/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just saying nobody else‚Äôs opinion matters
11/21/19, 8:30 PM - Marianna: We don‚Äôt do a ton of drinking games in my group actually
11/21/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: I mean I feel like their opinions do matter though
11/21/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: But hey it's okay, I think it'll be great
11/21/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: I'd prefer the if they liked me though
11/21/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: And so would you I think
11/21/19, 8:32 PM - Marianna: I mean yeah
11/21/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm not worried that they wont
11/21/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: So I don‚Äôt care about their opinions
11/21/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: If that makes any sense
11/21/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: I mean you do talk about how great and cool you are
11/21/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Sooooo
11/21/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt you worry either
11/21/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Please

11/21/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: About anything
11/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah I was gonna say
11/21/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: I guess I feel the most uneasy about sitting down with a bunch of basically strangers and having to get to know them really quickly
11/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: But then I remembered I do that a lot without even trying
11/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Maybe the stakes just feel higher?
11/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Isk
11/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Idk*
11/21/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: But yes! It'll be fine, I'm actually excited
11/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Yeah dude you do that all the time
11/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Plus
11/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: My group has had to do that for everyone else‚Äôs boys
11/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: And girls I guess
11/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: Well kushi
11/21/19, 8:41 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs a very different situation
11/21/19, 8:42 PM - Marianna: And the only one we didn‚Äôt like was Willem and that was only because he screwed with Maggie‚Äôs head and emotions so as long as you don‚Äôt do that you‚Äôre fine!
11/21/19, 8:42 PM - Marianna: And I feel like that‚Äôs a pretty low bar tbh
11/21/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: I think betsy is looking forward to getting to know you
11/21/19, 8:43 PM - Marianna: My friends are people people like a new person is not going to be seen as a bad thing if you hang out with us occasionally whenever you want
11/21/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Hey

11/21/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: So currently we're wondering the streets of Athens in light rain
11/21/19, 8:59 PM - Caleb: I'm not one to use the word vibe
11/21/19, 9:00 PM - Caleb: So holy shit this is such an unique atmosphere
11/21/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: Why say ‚Äúunique atmosphere‚Äù when you can just say ‚Äúvibe‚Äù
11/21/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: Saves you so many letters
11/21/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: Have you tracked down any beer?

11/21/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: Throwback to the two (three?) times we played
11/21/19, 9:25 PM - Caleb: First was best
11/21/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: Wait we played more than once?
11/21/19, 9:34 PM - Marianna: I thought it was just wine night in the park
11/21/19, 9:37 PM - Caleb: There was one time in my flat
11/21/19, 9:38 PM - Caleb: Before we decided to stay home
11/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Oh woah that feels so long ago
11/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: It was only 2 months ago
11/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Not even
11/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: That was a good weekend
11/21/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Even with your stupid field study
11/21/19, 9:56 PM - Caleb: I'm glad
11/21/19, 9:57 PM - Caleb: I'm really glad
11/21/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: And yeah that was a good bit ago, last week of September I think?
11/21/19, 9:59 PM - Caleb: Also it turns out that participation is a huge huge grade in that class, so I'm sorry but I'm glad I didn't skip
11/21/19, 10:00 PM - Caleb: I really wish you could have came along though
11/21/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I would never ask you to skip
11/21/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm sorry but I also did want to spend some time with my girls
11/21/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: And rosenborg was sooooo cool
11/21/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: And we saw the trampolines on the sidewalks!!!
11/21/19, 10:15 PM - Marianna: Loved those
11/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Honestly I totally understand
11/21/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Don't worry about it
11/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: How about this
11/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt
11/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I promise
11/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm against worrying in general rn
11/21/19, 10:41 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm catching up with my journal currently
11/21/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Oh! That reminds me
11/21/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: I bought this cute 2020 calendar from Muji and it has a spot for writing about each day
11/21/19, 10:43 PM - Caleb: And I was probably going to use the spot as daily goals and writing a sentence about the day
11/21/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: Ooooh
11/21/19, 10:51 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs good
11/21/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: Keeping expectations small for how much you can write each day at least works REALLY well for me
11/21/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/21/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: And also I feel like goals in the morning and a one sentence reflection at night is a good way to keep track of how things are going and keep improving
11/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Also now we're playing photo roulette
11/21/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Have you ever heard of this
11/21/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Fun Linux config I figured out: if my laptop is hooked up to something with HDMI, I can literally close my laptop lid and it keeps working on the TV or whatever
11/21/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Also I'm hecking tired so I'm going to hit the hay
11/21/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Goodnight! Talk to you tomorrow
11/21/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a very mature way to have a routine of checking on how you‚Äôre doing emotionally wow
11/21/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: And no but it sounds dangerous for some people of it has to do with going through random photos on people‚Äôs phones

11/22/19, 9:01 AM - Caleb: What does "a normal coffee machine" mean
11/22/19, 9:01 AM - Caleb: As in not an espresso?
11/22/19, 9:49 AM - Marianna: No like the batch coffee machines
11/22/19, 9:49 AM - Marianna: The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù before keurigs came around
11/22/19, 9:49 AM - Marianna: Or at least that‚Äôs how I think about it
11/22/19, 9:49 AM - Marianna: The whole ‚Äúmaking a pot of coffee‚Äù guys
11/22/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: Oh!  And you were talking about settings like an intention or focus for each day or something
11/22/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: And do you use chrome
11/22/19, 9:50 AM - Marianna: Is there even a chrome for Linux?
11/22/19, 9:51 AM - Marianna: Because I have an extension on my chrome that I just reinstalled (idk why I uninstalled it) that asks you what your focus for the day is every morning and you can also place todos and such that you see whenever you open a new tab
11/22/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: Wow I'm so proudb
11/22/19, 10:39 AM - Caleb: And yep! There's chrome on linux

11/22/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Don't tell me you use chrome
11/22/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Of course I use chrome it have the best design
11/22/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/22/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: Hey how are ya what have you been up to today?
11/22/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Oh my gosh you're one of those people
11/22/19, 11:58 AM - Caleb: I'm so sorry
11/22/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: And this is what I'm up to today
11/22/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Right now I'm at the foot of the Acropolis
11/22/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: I'll put the pics on my camera tonight
11/22/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: üòçüòç
11/22/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Sarahs skipping all her classes today so I‚Äôm all alone at school
11/22/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: We learned about cool stuff in crypto and compbio though!
11/22/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: HIDDEN MARKOV CHAINS
11/22/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Well sounds the opposite of fun
11/22/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: also like the statistic probability of a base occurring after a certain base in dna
11/22/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: And hang on what
11/22/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: That sounds kinda cool
11/22/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: But also is very gene dependent
11/22/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: DNA isn't random
11/22/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: And what's a hidden Markov chain
11/22/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs pretty cool
11/22/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: And yes Febe dependent for probabilities most likely
11/22/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: But he also talked about training the probablities on test data and then applying it to something else so maybe not so much
11/22/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Idk
11/22/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Are introns random?
11/22/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Why would they need to not be random?
11/22/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: What dictates them?
11/22/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs a Markov chain with hidden states
11/22/19, 12:48 PM - Marianna: Like when two outcomes can be produced by two different causes and you can‚Äôt tell which one causes it
11/22/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: But there‚Äôs an algorithm to figure it out as long as you know the probability of the transitions of the hidden states
11/22/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: Cool
11/22/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: But Markov chains kind of confuse me
11/22/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: I think we did them in discrete
11/22/19, 12:49 PM - Marianna: And anything we did in discrete just leaves a bad taste in my mouth
11/22/19, 12:50 PM - Marianna: Is that a saying?  Idk where my brain got that
11/22/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Well it sounds cool and I don't understand it
11/22/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: But hey you're cool and I mostly understand you so yay
11/22/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:52 PM - Caleb: Also hi welcome to the Parthenon
11/22/19, 1:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you mostly understand me I guess
11/22/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: Wait like in general or just what I said rn
11/22/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: AND OH THOSE ARE COOL
11/22/19, 1:12 PM - Marianna: panoramas are so cool but it‚Äôs always hard to post of print then because of their size
11/22/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/22/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: Unless you get a wiiiiiide print
11/22/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: I've got one of those
11/22/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: It's wonderful
11/22/19, 1:21 PM - Caleb: And if there is ever a time for a panorama, it's now
11/22/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: And I'd say I understand you fairly well but I think thats your call to make
11/22/19, 1:22 PM - Caleb: I was more talking about the Discreet stuff
11/22/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Ooooh that is cool
11/22/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Shutterfly only has free 4x6 and square prints I think
11/22/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: So that‚Äôs what I do
11/22/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: And well I think you don‚Äôt have to understand me all the time
11/22/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Occasionally maybe
11/22/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: But my brain also does some funky things and says sentences that only sometimes make sense
11/22/19, 1:34 PM - Marianna: So that‚Äôs okay
11/22/19, 1:48 PM - Caleb: Hey toooootally rAnDoM question but if you could describe your taste in jewelery what would you say it is
11/22/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: Also this is a dumb question but for some reason I feel like you don't have your ears pierced
11/22/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: Hey toooooootally raNDoM reminder you don‚Äôt have to spend money on me
11/22/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: If that‚Äôs anyhow related
11/22/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: But I like long dangly necklaces I think
11/22/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: I wear scarves more often but I‚Äôll do necklaces with dresses
11/22/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: And I had them pierced but they closed up
11/22/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: I was allergic to cheap metal earrings
11/22/19, 1:54 PM - Marianna: And let me tell you reacting to metal you stick in your body is not fun
11/22/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: So I could only wear like real gold or silver earrings and I didn‚Äôt want to regularly so I let the holes  close
11/22/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: Ok Coolio
11/22/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: Thanks for the totally random answer
11/22/19, 1:59 PM - Marianna: Okay coolio
11/22/19, 1:59 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre gonna make goulash in Hungarian class
11/22/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: OOOOO
11/22/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: Sounds good
11/22/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Have fun!
11/22/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Talk to ya after class
11/22/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: Also re: about spending money on you
11/22/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: It's something I enjoy! I really like giving gifts, so please don't feel obligated to spend money on me
11/22/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: Nor do I feel obligated to spend on you
11/22/19, 2:22 PM - Caleb: It's something I do because I enjoy it, I promise
11/22/19, 2:30 PM - Marianna: Well that works I guess
11/22/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: I like giving gifts but only for occasions I think
11/22/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: Like I run out of ideas
11/22/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: Is gift giving your love language?
11/22/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: Or I guess just what is your love language?
11/22/19, 2:31 PM - Marianna: Or have you taken that test before?
11/22/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: Did I tell you were putting Aladdin on in Hungarian class
11/22/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: Like a shortened version of the play
11/22/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: And guess who I am
11/22/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Unless I‚Äôve already told you in case this will not be a guessing game
11/22/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: I've taken the test before, but I don't totally remember what it was
11/22/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: Gift giving is definitely one of them though
11/22/19, 3:04 PM - Caleb: What are yours?
11/22/19, 3:05 PM - Caleb: And no you didn't! I'm gonna guess Abu because I think it suits you a bit
11/22/19, 3:30 PM - Marianna: Idk what it‚Äôs called but it‚Äôs the words one
11/22/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: Like saying and hearing sweet things is what I love to do/receive
11/22/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: And no!
11/22/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm jasmine!!
11/22/19, 3:31 PM - Marianna: You think I‚Äôm the monkey?!?!?
11/22/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: ....
11/22/19, 3:32 PM - Caleb: Noooo I meant jasmine
11/22/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: I thought her name was apu?
11/22/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: Sure
11/22/19, 3:35 PM - Marianna: _if you‚Äôre received this message..._
11/22/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: NOOOOO
11/22/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: Also another one of mine is physical affection
11/22/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: But these are just from my own understanding of myself
11/22/19, 3:37 PM - Caleb: I should probably take the test again
11/22/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Brussels?
11/22/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: Okay I guess I‚Äôll talk to you
11/22/19, 3:39 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/22/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: HA got you to break the silence
11/22/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: I win
11/22/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: And yeah if you want we can do it next weekend
11/22/19, 3:43 PM - Caleb: However, I'm gonna request that we don't stay in bed the _whole_ time üòâ
11/22/19, 3:44 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I‚Äôm okay with that
11/22/19, 3:44 PM - Marianna: I do want to see brussels
11/22/19, 3:44 PM - Marianna: But some time maybe yeah?
11/22/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/22/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: I mean things _do_ close at a certain time though, so maybe after
11/22/19, 3:48 PM - Caleb: Oh! Do you have anything specific you want to do?
11/22/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: The chocolate museum?
11/22/19, 3:53 PM - Marianna: That is a fair point
11/22/19, 3:53 PM - Marianna: Do you want me to come up with an itinerary?  I do like doing that
11/22/19, 3:53 PM - Marianna: But you‚Äôve also been before so if you have any pointers of what we should do or should avoid that would be helpful
11/22/19, 3:53 PM - Marianna: But certainly the chocolate museum
11/22/19, 3:54 PM - Marianna: And would you be at all interested in going to a club Saturday night?  Idk what there is there but I could look into it
11/22/19, 3:54 PM - Marianna: But then again we‚Äôll probably be tired and want to just be home
11/22/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Hi I miss you
11/22/19, 4:35 PM - Caleb: I swear I'm sober, I'm just watching a really pretty sunset from the Acropolis and thought how much I'd like it if you were here
11/22/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Re: the club
11/22/19, 4:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah definitely! It'd be so much fun
11/22/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: And re: the itinerary
11/22/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: I haven't actually been to Brussels, I've only been to Bruges
11/22/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: And if you actually enjoy doing those things, then yes please! I'd feel bad if you were doing all the work though
11/22/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: Hi I miss ya too
11/22/19, 4:58 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm sober too
11/22/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Look at us go
11/22/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Sunset is pretty!
11/22/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: And okay!  I am more than happy to do it it gives me something to do in my classes ü§≠
11/22/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Also!  Got my new phone!
11/22/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: Now I need to figure out how to set it up
11/22/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: OOO which phone did you get?
11/22/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: I'm gonna guess it's an iPhone
11/22/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Yup
11/22/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Xr
11/22/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs gonna feel so big
11/22/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Oh gosh this backup is gonna last forever
11/22/19, 5:31 PM - Caleb: Make sure to back up WhatsApp separately!
11/22/19, 5:32 PM - Caleb: I think by default it does it once a week
11/22/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Also enjoy your no headphone jack, sorry boot that
11/22/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: I wish I had imessage honestly
11/22/19, 5:33 PM - Caleb: Maybe next phone
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: Ugh
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so frustrated at this
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: It won‚Äôt let me use my old backup because this phone is too old
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: So rn I‚Äôm gonna leave it before I throw it at a wall
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: What does that even mean
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: How
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Caleb: Why
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: (Kidding)
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: You know I don‚Äôt know
11/22/19, 5:52 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs part of the FRUSTRATION
11/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: I think something to do with the OS
11/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: but I tried to do it once and now it won‚Äôt let me try again after telling me it wouldn‚Äôt work the first time
11/22/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: üôÑ
11/22/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Im so sorry
11/22/19, 5:53 PM - Caleb: Thats so dumb
11/22/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: Okay I think I found a Apple docs about it
11/22/19, 5:55 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm going to go to the Christmas festival to find sarah and her parents
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I hate apple
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: They canta use normal people words
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm someone who is generally pretty good at technology right
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: But not with anything apple says
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre so niche and fancy
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: üôÑ
11/22/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: Oh and now my data‚Äôs not working on this iPhone great
11/22/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah they make it so bro-talky
11/22/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Idk
11/22/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: I think Apple is obnoxious
11/22/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Also what bands do you have on your phone?
11/22/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: It might not support GSM if you have a Verizon phone
11/22/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: Also now we've gotten cheap wine in a plastic bottle and mixed it with sprite
11/22/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: We're dubbing it "Hooch"
11/22/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: GSM?
11/22/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs an att phone
11/22/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Sounds about right
11/22/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: GSM and CDMA are the two main radio band types in phones
11/22/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Is it working?
11/22/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: You back?
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: We have something called froccs
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Which is wine and sparkling water
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like it
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: Sarah does
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOSH
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: It's like HOOCH
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm now trying to update it
11/22/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: I love my friends
11/22/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: And we're going to a club owned by Lindsey Lohan
11/22/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Wait a second are we both about to be drunk on the same night.
11/22/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Holy cow
11/22/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Pigs are flying
11/22/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Hell is frozen over
11/22/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: Other euphemisms for this is rare
11/22/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Update now having drunk gyros
11/22/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Greece is wonderful
11/22/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: It is like hooch
11/22/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: But a little classier probably
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Mar
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm not gonna start drinking until I‚Äôve got this phone figured out but maybe eventually I‚Äôll be drunk with you tonight
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Robin wants me to rally
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: It's $3 wine and sprite
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: But rally marianna is dead
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: That's debatable
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: :(
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: üôÑ
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a big fan of this emoji tonight
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Rip rally mar
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: You really are
11/22/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: It's my second time getting it
11/22/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: And one was directed at your phone so I'm ok
11/22/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: She was never a great version of me
11/22/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Not a bad version
11/22/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: But not the best
11/22/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/22/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs my mood tonight
11/22/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Why the heck are my boots still on
11/22/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: What was I thinking
11/22/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Also tminus 5 ish minutes until we see if what I tried with my phone worked
11/22/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Odds I end up just jailbreaking it?
11/22/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Actually I‚Äôm not sure that would make it take the backup any easier
11/22/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I mean
11/22/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: My iTunes might not want to play with a jail breaked phone
11/22/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: I'm always an advocate for freedom
11/22/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Go jailbreaking
11/22/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: It does introduce complications though
11/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/22/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna try not to come to that
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: GO
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: TECH
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: FREEDOM
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Foss is heaven
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: Update I made my mom get game pigeon so now we‚Äôre playing games as she‚Äôs on hold with att
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: And hell
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want to break anything
11/22/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Game pigeon?
11/22/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: This would be a remarkably expensive thing to break
11/22/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: And yeah
11/22/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: You can play games between iPhones over iMessage
11/22/19, 7:46 PM - Marianna: Robin and I are currently on hour 6 of battleship
11/22/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Yeah bricking an XR would make my stomach sink
11/22/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: I WANNA PLAY GAMES WITH YOU
11/22/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Gosh darn it
11/22/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: WhatsApp doesn‚Äôt do that that I‚Äôm aware of
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: BOOOOOOO
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: I will be so happy to be done with WhatsApp in a month
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: But those green texts ü§¢
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: KIDDING
11/22/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Okay
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: And yay about Brussels!!!!
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: But does it actually matter to you

11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Caleb
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: And even if it does I have no right to not like talking to you just because you don‚Äôt have an iPhone
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Because it's one of the main reasons I've debated getting a 6s
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs like the most privileged thing
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: Like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to talk to people with iPhones‚Äù
11/22/19, 7:51 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs easier

11/22/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: I sue mine too much too
11/22/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: I can set limits on how much time I can spend on apps but I don‚Äôt want to
11/22/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: But that feels mature to do
11/22/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: But idk how to do it
11/22/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: I've just deleted the apps I use too much actually

11/22/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Thats why I bought my phone unlocked

11/23/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: Yeah that sounds about right
11/23/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm in the city center and I don‚Äôt feel like here is super touristy
11/23/19, 1:06 PM - Marianna: But the Christmas market was super touristy last night
11/23/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: Honestly didn‚Äôt like it all that much
11/23/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: But it was mostly because I got not very good food for very expensive on the Budapest scale
11/23/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: I also kind of felt like I was invading Sarahs time with her parents so
11/23/19, 1:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna still go back again but maybe not get food just mulled wine and take in all the happenings
11/23/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: Oh that's right! Sarah's parents are there!
11/23/19, 1:18 PM - Caleb: Have you seen them a lot?
11/23/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Only Christmas market last night
11/23/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: They were jet lagged yesterday and I had class
11/23/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: Sarahs showing them buda sights today
11/23/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm working on paper
11/23/19, 1:21 PM - Marianna: But you know I should probably open my laptop if I‚Äôm gonna keep saying that
11/23/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: You know
11/23/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: That might be wise
11/23/19, 1:30 PM - Caleb: How long is it?
11/23/19, 1:31 PM - Caleb: Both in its current stage and it's final form
11/23/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/23/19, 1:36 PM - Marianna: It has to be ~10 pages
11/23/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Hey you should check out this YouTube channel
11/23/19, 1:43 PM - Caleb: Then you can kill time watching videos and it's "research "
11/23/19, 1:44 PM - Caleb: Ok I'm going into the metro but I'll send them when I'm out
11/23/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm now looking at ‚ÄúBiopunk‚Äù books
11/23/19, 1:53 PM - Marianna: Did not even know this was a genre but I‚Äôve heard of a good deal of these books
11/23/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: https://youtu.be/J3FcbFqSoQY
11/23/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: Watch that
11/23/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: He's actually one of my personal heros
11/23/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: Hi do you have python 3 on your laptop?
11/23/19, 2:14 PM - Marianna: Or have you not updated it yet?
11/23/19, 2:22 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm gonna listen to instrumental Christmas music as I read a 30 page synbio paper yay fun saturday!
11/23/19, 2:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah I have python on my laptop
11/23/19, 2:32 PM - Caleb: Why?
11/23/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: If I sent you a code to run, could you try it
11/23/19, 2:32 PM - Caleb: Yeah but not for a few hours
11/23/19, 2:32 PM - Caleb: I'm beach bound!
11/23/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: And don't have my laptop with me
11/23/19, 2:33 PM - Caleb: Sorry
11/23/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: I have python3 and it was written before python3 was around idk if all the imports are still supported but mine won‚Äôt do it in python3 and it would not be easy to figure out the new imports and codes from what I have read online
11/23/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Yeah no problem!
11/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not a big deal
11/23/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: Just do a python 2 installation
11/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: If it works I‚Äôll add it to my paper but it‚Äôd be like 3 sentences so I won‚Äôt die if I don‚Äôt get it
11/23/19, 2:34 PM - Caleb: You can have two installations at the same time
11/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt want to mess up my python3
11/23/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/23/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: Install python 2.7, and you can install packages for each one separately
11/23/19, 2:35 PM - Caleb: Wait do you use anaconda or pip
11/23/19, 2:35 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the difference
11/23/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: They're different package managers
11/23/19, 2:36 PM - Marianna: I dj
11/23/19, 2:36 PM - Marianna: Idk**
11/23/19, 2:36 PM - Marianna: I just click for mac everytime
11/23/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: Okay so pip probably
11/23/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: Do you not install packages for python?
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: Nope just the language as far as I can tell
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: Idk man
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Uhuh
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: This is the stuff we are never actually taught
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: That's actually kinda disappointing
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Marianna: But hey go to the beach don‚Äôt worry about me
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: So don't worry about anaconda
11/23/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Just get python 2
11/23/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Then when you want to use python 3, all you need to do is type 'python3 program.py' to run something
11/23/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: And typing 'python program.py' should use python 2
11/23/19, 2:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah I did that
11/23/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: It didn‚Äôt yet at me that I didn‚Äôt have python 2
11/23/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: Maybe I still have it
11/23/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: And to install packages to either one, you just use 'pip install' to install it to python2 or 'pip3' for python 3
11/23/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: Because I did at some point
11/23/19, 2:39 PM - Caleb: Type 'which python' in terminal
11/23/19, 2:39 PM - Marianna: /usr/bin/python
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: I get a nasty url error with just python
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: It might be that the stuff is too old
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: I wrote this code in like 2018
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Just type 'python -V' then
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: Ah 2.7.10
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Ah
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: So I do have it
11/23/19, 2:40 PM - Marianna: Thank you for knowing how to work a terminal
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: I like GUIs man
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: So idk what to do now
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: I mean I can just leave it out if I can spend time debugging and reading but I think that‚Äôs gonna be a last edition to the paper
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Yeah but the current one is 2.7.15
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: So back to synbio reading
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: No 2.7.17 came out a month ago
11/23/19, 2:41 PM - Marianna: But yeah close
11/23/19, 2:42 PM - Marianna: But this code DID work with whatever python I was running so I doubt it‚Äôd be that
11/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: 'brew install python@2' should upgrade
11/23/19, 2:42 PM - Caleb: Idk though, I use Mac so rarely idk what their current package manager is
11/23/19, 2:42 PM - Marianna: Brew is not it
11/23/19, 2:42 PM - Marianna: I can google
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Sounds good
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: I remember using brew on Linux though
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: If you still need it tonight just email it to me
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: I like the word brew
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: Brrrrrewwwww
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Brreeewwww
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Also wait what
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Caleb: Which distro uses brew?
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: Uh I have no idea
11/23/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve used it before so I assumed it was on Linux
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Usually it's snap, pacman, or apt
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Whatever
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Doesn't matter
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: How are you
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: How's your day
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Oh google says brew is Mac
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Idk man
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Good
11/23/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Need to work tough
11/23/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: Though
11/23/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: And you need to beach
11/23/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm gonna put phone away and read
11/23/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: Goodnightish
11/23/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/23/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: I'm proud of you
11/23/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: Just want to let you know
11/23/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: You're smart as hell and work super hard, you got this
11/23/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: (just stop procrastinating)
11/23/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: Good day!
11/23/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: Thank you
11/23/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: Yeah I can work hard when I‚Äôm not procrastinating
11/23/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: And not to put salt in the wound but man I‚Äôd rather be cuddling you and writing this paper
11/23/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: It might not be very productive that way but it sounds like fun
11/23/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: I just took 20 min to stretch because I was falling asleep
11/23/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Has anyone told you that bio jargon is kind of a lot?
11/23/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Because
11/23/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: It is
11/23/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/23/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Bio is SUPER jargon heavy
11/23/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Don't worry I'm well aware
11/23/19, 4:18 PM - Caleb: You get super far down the rabbit hole just by looking up terms you don't know
11/23/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/23/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: I fell into that rabbit hole
11/23/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: And I decided it did not matter if I knew what a genetic circuit was
11/23/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: As long as I‚Äôve got the general idea I don‚Äôt need to be able to implement them
11/23/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: But from what I could tell they sound cool
11/23/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: I think i would have been working with them last summer if I had done research at davidson
11/23/19, 4:33 PM - Caleb: Oh sweet mar genetics are the tip of the jargon
11/23/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: Bio jargon leads onto genetics jargon which leads to Chem jargon which leads into physics jargon
11/23/19, 4:34 PM - Caleb: It's jargon all the way down
11/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Which does lead into math jargon!
11/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: I can do math jargon!
11/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Remember
11/23/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: SZWOOOSH
11/23/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: or whatever sound I made for that complex analysis concept
11/23/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt even remember what it‚Äôs called anymore
11/23/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Uh oh
11/23/19, 4:41 PM - Caleb: So everything is applied math?
11/23/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: ...
11/23/19, 4:42 PM - Marianna: I mean
11/23/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Yes
11/23/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: But applied mathematicians can‚Äôt do anything which is why society still needs to hold all other fields equally valuable
11/23/19, 4:43 PM - Caleb: But math is just applied philosophy
11/23/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: Can‚Äôt do everything**
11/23/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: And um no
11/23/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: Um yes
11/23/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: What makes a number a number
11/23/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: Why does 1+1 =2
11/23/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
11/23/19, 4:45 PM - Marianna: Because it does
11/23/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: Because we have assigned arbitrary names to things
11/23/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: But mathematical principles are natural and no one came up with them or thought them up
11/23/19, 4:46 PM - Marianna: That when you put ‚Äúone‚Äù and ‚Äúone‚Äù next to each other, you now have ‚Äútwo‚Äù of them. Thems the facts
11/23/19, 4:51 PM - Marianna: Update on paper‚Äîhave a ton of notes and a pretty good structure outline so I‚Äôm gonna take a break
11/23/19, 4:53 PM - Caleb: I mean I was just teasing but I genuinely think the philosophy of math is so interesting
11/23/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Would make great cuddle talk sometime
11/23/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Also good work! Thats definitely the hardest part
11/23/19, 4:54 PM - Caleb: Hey wanna see beach pictures
11/23/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/23/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/23/19, 5:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah

11/23/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Trolling
11/23/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: Thrilling**
11/23/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: Amazing what a simple tickle can do
11/23/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: YOU CAUSED THAT
11/23/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: YOU ARE AWFUL
11/23/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: They were pulling a siddhesh and having me take a million couple pictures
11/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: And by pulling a siddhesh I mean not asking, but telling me to take them
11/23/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Oooooh I‚Äôm sorry
11/23/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: People need to stop doing that to you
11/23/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: The other couple on the trip asked me to get some for them and they saw and went "hey get some of us"
11/23/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/23/19, 5:15 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/23/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: They turned out GREAT though
11/23/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: I thought you liked taking pictures of people?
11/23/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: I do like taking pictures
11/23/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: I don't like being demanded to take pictures
11/23/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: I mean it still sucks that people just dictate it
11/23/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: I think I offer to take pictures so I never get told
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: I mean I offer too, but people still end up telling me
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Whatever it's not the point
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Oh still a bummer
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Nope
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: No bummer
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Only summer
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: ... In November
11/23/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not summer

11/23/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: No matter if you were at a beach or not
11/23/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: You look so happy
11/23/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: I gotta say
11/23/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: I am

11/23/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: Looks like a fun day
11/23/19, 5:28 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs warm enough
11/23/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: How was the water temperature?
11/23/19, 5:37 PM - Caleb: Once you get in it was like early September in Davidson
11/23/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Oooh la la
11/23/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Sounds so nice
11/23/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: In other news I haven‚Äôt left the house today
11/23/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: :)
11/23/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: But I think I have been the most productive I‚Äôve been in a good lo time
11/23/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Yay!
11/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: Hey its alright
11/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: We all have days like that
11/23/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: And boy are they nice every once in a while
11/23/19, 5:58 PM - Caleb: Also I'm in this really nice restaurant right now and it's happy hour and I got this fresh salmon and risotto dish and a glass of wine and it's like $15

11/23/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Hey
11/23/19, 6:29 PM - Marianna: Would you like cooking with marianna updates tongiht in a little bit?
11/23/19, 6:30 PM - Caleb: YES PLEASE!
11/23/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: It's been a hot second
11/23/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: WE GOT TEN FREE SHOTS S AS A THANK YOU
11/23/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL
11/23/19, 7:08 PM - Caleb: AND CHOCOLATE
11/23/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: They're sipping shots
11/23/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: A thank you for what?
11/23/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: And chocolate?
11/23/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: What chocolate?
11/23/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: And why are they sipping shots?
11/23/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: I am so full of questions
11/23/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Just for being a big group there

11/24/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: Would totally be down for ice skating
11/24/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôve got a ginger beer, spiced rum, banana liqueur, basil, and orange drink and it‚Äôs odd
11/24/19, 12:00 AM - Marianna: We‚Äôre sitting by the bathroom and they‚Äôre gender neutral and so many people are confused which one they should go to it‚Äôs hilarious
11/24/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: I JUST RAN INTO A KID I DID A SERVICE TRIP WITH IN HIGH SCHOOL IN SZIMPLA
11/24/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: it‚Äôs such a small world
11/24/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Also I definitely miss you szimpla reminded me of having you with me at szimpla which was very fun and gosh pda is such a thing here but I want to pda!  So I need ya!  Help me out here!
11/24/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Oh man my Snapchat memory from a year ago says I was in Hilton Head and yeah that sounds nice rn not like nice enough to leave Budapest but nice idk what my parents are gonna do without me at thanksgiving
11/24/19, 7:53 AM - Caleb: Holy cow
11/24/19, 7:53 AM - Caleb: That's absolutely crazy
11/24/19, 7:55 AM - Caleb: What a small world
11/24/19, 7:58 AM - Caleb: I bet he was so incredibly shocked
11/24/19, 7:58 AM - Caleb: I mean I was when I saw Stefan in London
11/24/19, 7:58 AM - Caleb: And I'm kinda sad we never got together but holy cow that was wild
11/24/19, 7:58 AM - Caleb: Is he just on vacation or something?
11/24/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: Also, about the itinerary: is bruges out of the plan then? I don't want to push it if it is, but I think it would be a fun day trip
11/24/19, 8:09 AM - Caleb: It's about an hour by train, and we could go in the morning and come back in time for the Christmas market in Brussels
11/24/19, 9:03 AM - Caleb: Or we could also do Antwerp which is like 20‚Ç¨ a ticket and 30 minutes away
11/24/19, 9:03 AM - Caleb: I don't want to complicate things, I'm just putting out ideas
11/24/19, 10:16 AM - Marianna: Hi!  Good morning!
11/24/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: He‚Äôs studying abroad too
11/24/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know where
11/24/19, 10:17 AM - Marianna: But ive seen his photos of his travels on Instagram
11/24/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: And I was thinking we‚Äôd just stay in Brussels because I think there is enough to do there. It‚Äôs also only a weekend and two cities in a weekend‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre just 30min away‚Äîseems like a lot to try to squeeze in
11/24/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: What do you think?
11/24/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: You seem to really want to get out of Brussels?  Why?  Just to see somewhere else or is there something you want to do specifically in the other places?
11/24/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: I mean, I don't dislike Brussels or anything
11/24/19, 10:20 AM - Caleb: I've just heard that it's more metropolitan and less enchanting than Bruges
11/24/19, 10:21 AM - Caleb: And I've been looking it up and everywhere sorta says the same thing
11/24/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: It's up to you though
11/24/19, 10:22 AM - Caleb: I've seen Bruges before so I won't be heartbroken to not see it again
11/24/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: It's just so picturesque that I think youd love it and it would be a lot of fun to visit
11/24/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: I'm alright either way though, just look into it maybe?
11/24/19, 10:23 AM - Caleb: But hi! Good morning :)
11/24/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Ooooooh okay that makes sense
11/24/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to Bruges I think
11/24/19, 10:28 AM - Marianna: Let me take a looksie at it today or this week
11/24/19, 10:29 AM - Marianna: And oof part of me wants to get up and run but wow part of me really doesn‚Äôt want to
11/24/19, 10:30 AM - Caleb: Olay!
11/24/19, 10:30 AM - Caleb: I meant okay*
11/24/19, 10:30 AM - Caleb: But hey, Olay works too I guess
11/24/19, 10:31 AM - Caleb: And ouch, stuck between a rock and a hard place
11/24/19, 10:32 AM - Caleb: Or I guess stuck between a mattress and cozy blanket
11/24/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: Yeah we‚Äôre NOT going to Spain so no olay necessary
11/24/19, 10:33 AM - Marianna: Or is that Mexico idk
11/24/19, 10:34 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know if it deals with dancing or running from the bulls tbh
11/24/19, 10:34 AM - Marianna: But whatever
11/24/19, 10:34 AM - Marianna: And yeah pretty much
11/24/19, 10:34 AM - Marianna: What have you been up to today?
11/24/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: Or European football matches
11/24/19, 10:41 AM - Caleb: "OOOOLAAY OLAY OLAY OLAAAAAY"
11/24/19, 10:47 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah
11/24/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/24/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: But anyway
11/24/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: Uneventful day

11/24/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: And yeah I'm boarding right now
11/24/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: So the streets just get filled with junk and old funiture and stuff but some of it is also useful so people are welcome to take from the piles
11/24/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: Oh my gosh
11/24/19, 10:49 AM - Caleb: That sounds so cool
11/24/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: And of course we had a giant pile right outside our front door from other apts in the building
11/24/19, 10:50 AM - Caleb: My mom would love that
11/24/19, 10:50 AM - Caleb: Got any pictures?

11/24/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: We didn‚Äôt know what it was for the longest time but this is the article I found about it and it has some pictures
11/24/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/24/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Okay that looks less nice than I was picturing
11/24/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Still sounds super interesting though
11/24/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: Yeah no it‚Äôs a bunch of junk in piles
11/24/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: Not organized
11/24/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: And then the trash guys came early yesterday morning it was so loud for them to clear it all away
11/24/19, 10:54 AM - Marianna: But it was weird to be here for it and be like uh what is going on
11/24/19, 10:58 AM - Caleb: Gotta love those fUn CuLtUrAl QuIrKs
11/24/19, 10:59 AM - Caleb: I was mostly thinking old furniture and books, sorta like street thrift stores

11/24/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: Caleb
11/24/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so happy for the cheesecake for you
11/24/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: But SHEESH
11/24/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: I think you could lose your medical license over this or something
11/24/19, 6:39 PM - Marianna: Giving someone allergens to eat sounds like malpractice
11/24/19, 6:40 PM - Caleb: SHE'S THE ONE THAT ORDERED IT
11/24/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: She's poutily sipping her Tropical Latvian now
11/24/19, 6:41 PM - Caleb: Distraught over not getting more cheesecake
11/24/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Hey more for you!
11/24/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Tropical Latvian?
11/24/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: It's a Latvian cocktail
11/24/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: It's like a tequila sunrise, but local vodka and some other tropical stuff
11/24/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Hej how are you!
11/24/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Well yes I assumed that
11/24/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: Oooooh that sounds fun

11/24/19, 7:09 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good!  Finally got out of bed and am heating up dinner rn
11/24/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: And then I‚Äôll work on stuff after
11/24/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: We just left the restaurant and started walking the streets
11/24/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: And HOLY COW
11/24/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: If you ever get the chance to roam the streets of an Eastern European city on a sunday night, do it
11/24/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: There are so many beautiful old buildings and cobblestone steets and you have it all to yourself
11/24/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: It's so quiet
11/24/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: I mean don‚Äôt I do that all the time?
11/24/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt you done that in Budapest with me?
11/24/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: I
11/24/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Uh
11/24/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Yeah I suppose that's true isn't it
11/24/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: I feel like budapest is perpetually touristy though
11/24/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Who the hell comes to Riga
11/24/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs fair
11/24/19, 7:35 PM - Marianna: But still Budapest is less touristy than other places
11/24/19, 7:36 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm holding that Budapest is the best and perfect level of touristy sights without tourism
11/24/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/24/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: I maintain Copenhagen is the best for living
11/24/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: No
11/24/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: üòê
11/24/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/24/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: But it's not a competition
11/24/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Well yeah it‚Äôs not a competition
11/24/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: It just sounds like we ended up in great places for us
11/24/19, 7:40 PM - Caleb: Like, there was no chance of any other programs besides direct enrollment that give bio and medicine and comp sci
11/24/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: And now I have so much free time and I travel so much, and still learn a lot of awesome things
11/24/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so true and isn‚Äôt that so amazing!!!
11/24/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Honestly I was regretting Copenhagen a bit in the beginning, but honestly I've ended up being so happy with it
11/24/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Either through sheer will of making myself be happy, or maybe I just naturally realized it
11/24/19, 7:41 PM - Caleb: Idk though
11/24/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: Gotta say I'm happy here sitting in a bar in Riga Latvia listening to a live band covering "Ain't Nothing but a Hound Dog"
11/24/19, 7:42 PM - Caleb: And talking to this spectacular girl who's not too too far away
11/24/19, 7:43 PM - Caleb: And I'm seeing in a few days
11/24/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs me!

11/24/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Currently it's Sunday night and I'm doing a shot of the local liquor
11/24/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Solely because Hannah really needed to use the bathroom and I told her we could go into a bar and I'd get a drink so she could
11/24/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: Ha that‚Äôs fair
11/24/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: Nothing wrong with that in my opinion

11/25/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: If you don't have too much work, would you want to call tonight?
11/25/19, 10:47 AM - Marianna: Nah it‚Äôs just a me thing it‚Äôs not even a rational bad day it‚Äôs just one of those days

11/25/19, 10:48 AM - Marianna: And maybe!  I should look at the paper but other than that I think that‚Äôs be nice so I will try to make sure I have time to talk to ya but I should also sleep early
11/25/19, 10:51 AM - Caleb: Well hey, it's okay to not be rational sometimes
11/25/19, 10:51 AM - Caleb: It doesn't make it any less of a bad day
11/25/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: There doesn't need to be a reason behind everything, so even if you just want to yell about how you're feeling or something, I'm here
11/25/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: And okay! That sounds good
11/25/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: What have you got today?

11/25/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Also
11/25/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Got the urge to go to Antarctica odds I do that today instead of work?
11/25/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: I'm a cashew
11/25/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: HA
11/25/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: Thank you thank you
11/25/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: And let me be honest here, I've got a random feeling that you might not go to Antarctica
11/25/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: How about the North pole though?
11/25/19, 12:05 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôd I do to prompt being thanked
11/25/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good joke though
11/25/19, 12:06 PM - Marianna: And hmm yeah
11/25/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: North Pole is off limits this time of year
11/25/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Can‚Äôt have randos getting in the way of the elves doing their important work
11/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: I thanked you because I knew that you'd think it's absolutely _hysterical_
11/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: And yeah that's true
11/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: I'm still heartbroken you haven't seen Elf though
11/25/19, 12:29 PM - Caleb: That movie is a gem
11/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: I did laught
11/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: And I then I told it to friends
11/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: And they thought I was crazy
11/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: So no thanks for that
11/25/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: And yeah I know I need to see it but yeah
11/25/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm eating something heavenly for lunch
11/25/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: Ooo
11/25/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: What's for lunch?
11/25/19, 1:13 PM - Caleb: And good, that's part of the fun of dumb jokes
11/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Zucchini encrusted chicken with langos topping so sour cream and cheese
11/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: Very good
11/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: And yes
11/25/19, 1:38 PM - Marianna: That why I like them
11/25/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Oh woah
11/25/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: That sounds incredible
11/25/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: Meanwhile, my med ethics class had a discussion on a study about cavities, so naturally she brought in toffee for us
11/25/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: And I'm crashing so hard
11/25/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: So tired
11/25/19, 2:41 PM - Caleb: So, so tired
11/25/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Ooooh toffee is good
11/25/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had a long day
11/25/19, 2:49 PM - Marianna: Did you get to go back to your flat before having to go back to class?
11/25/19, 2:50 PM - Marianna: Do you have any more class today?
11/25/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah I've got another class, I'm done at 5:45
11/25/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: I did get back in the morning and caught a nap though
11/25/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: But it doesn't help much when you got up at 4:40
11/25/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: It's alright though, I'm looking at my schedule and it's almost smooth sailing to the end of the semester
11/25/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Yeah I almost know what you mean about the waking up that early thing
11/25/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: And wow I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve got stuff under control
11/25/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: Because I sure don‚Äôt
11/25/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not stressed
11/25/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: :)
11/25/19, 2:58 PM - Marianna: I think the crypto project is going to kill me
11/25/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey you got this
11/25/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: What do you need to do?
11/25/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: And also, it's not actually smooth sailing
11/25/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: It'll be smooth sailing if I'm proactive and start now
11/25/19, 3:01 PM - Caleb: Otherwise it'll be a shitshow
11/25/19, 3:02 PM - Caleb: But I feel like I've got enough discipline and foresight to make it smooth
11/25/19, 3:11 PM - Caleb: Oh sweet lord my professor gave me so much leftover candy, and I'm realizing maybe I don't have enough discipline here
11/25/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: Well besides the 4 final projects and the 3 final exams I have some other stuff but those are what‚Äôs stressing me rn
11/25/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs mostly crypto final project that is driving me crazy
11/25/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt get the prompt and I don‚Äôt know how to do it and he said our proposal was too difficult to implement which yeah I can see that I wouldn‚Äôt want to code what we proposed but I don‚Äôt know what to do that still covers all the necessities and is simple and it‚Äôs a group project where I don‚Äôt love the group and timing wise is hard to work out because I have other things and traveling and marions coming next week but I‚Äôm gonna have so much to do idk if I‚Äôll be able to show he around
11/25/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: And I still don‚Äôt feel great but I think it‚Äôs stress and feeling like I don‚Äôt have control so I was just gonna take it easy today but I really should just go home and write my paper
11/25/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: And hey share with flat mates?  Maybe they‚Äôll be nicer
11/25/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just remarkably stressed and don‚Äôt know how to handle everything on my plate like I‚Äôve got too many hours of class and 7(!) big things coming up for 5(!) classes
11/25/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/25/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to talk about school anymore
11/25/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to school anymore
11/25/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: So tell me about your day!  Anything not related to schoolwork maybe would be appreciated
11/25/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: And I def do want to call tonight to hear about your break!
11/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: You'll do great
11/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: I believe in you
11/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: We can definitely move on though
11/25/19, 4:05 PM - Caleb: Its been a weird day
11/25/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: It doesn't feel like the same day I was just hundreds of miles away
11/25/19, 4:06 PM - Caleb: And it REALLY doesn't feel like the same week I was on the beaches of the Mediterranean
11/25/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: OH do you know John I-forget-his-last-name
11/25/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: He is/was dating Meredith
11/25/19, 4:07 PM - Caleb: Apparently he'll be in Copenhagen on Thursday through Saturday, so I told him maybe we could grab a drink and hit up Tivoli
11/25/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Honestly I don't know him that well, but I think it'll be fun anyway
11/25/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Hey you don‚Äôt know that but thanks for the vote of confidence
11/25/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: No no, I know it
11/25/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: I dont know many things
11/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: But I know you'll at least make it out of this alive
11/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: unless you eat a bunch of stuff you're allergic to
11/25/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: ...please dont do that
11/25/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Also on the topic of eating things we shouldn't
11/25/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Oh lord
11/25/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: So much candy
11/25/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: wayyyyy too much candy
11/25/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: And yes John leiner
11/25/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: He seems really cool
11/25/19, 5:04 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt know him that well either
11/25/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah I need like a 40 get a pass out of this class and I think I already have a 50 so end of the day I‚Äôll pass on my davidson transcript
11/25/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: And hopefully I‚Äôll just get a job and won‚Äôt have to apply to grad school so no one cares about this grade...
11/25/19, 5:05 PM - Marianna: I bought myself haribo watermelons
11/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Because my usual motivation-to-do-work snack is cheezits or sour patch watermelon so I‚Äôll make do with what I can in Hungary
11/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your bad mood snack or need to be productive snack or just all around go to snack?
11/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Wondering for research purposes only of course
11/25/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: And what type of candy is this?
11/25/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Okay, this is probably the worst possible answer here
11/25/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: But honestly when I'm really really stressed out I lose my appetite and don't eat
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: So eventually my friends get me to go to commons and I'll stress eat scoopie
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Mooooooooo
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: WAIT
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: YOU LIKE SCOOPIE
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: ?
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: NO ONE LIKES SCOOPIE
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: ... i love scoopie
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: NO I LOVE SCOOPIE
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: WHAT
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: MY FRIENDS MAKE SO MUCH FUN OF ME FOR IT
11/25/19, 5:18 PM - Caleb: ohmygoshohmygosh
11/25/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: it‚Äôs my favorite
11/25/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: The more creative the better
11/25/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: I love the strawberry shortcake ones
11/25/19, 5:19 PM - Caleb: Or the lemon meringue
11/25/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: We joked that I should just take the entire bowl of pumpkin scoopie last fall
11/25/19, 5:20 PM - Marianna: Man now I miss scoopie
11/25/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOODNESS

11/25/19, 5:22 PM - Marianna: Should get some pudding and cake and mash it all together and make it SCOOPIE
11/25/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: No no
11/25/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: People have this idea of scoopie that its lazy and can be thrown together
11/25/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: But I personally believe there is nuance to scoopie
11/25/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: My friends think it‚Äôs just leftover desserts put together
11/25/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Lies
11/25/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Malarkey
11/25/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Heresy
11/25/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Its a medley of textures and flavors
11/25/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: Needs to be thought about
11/25/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: Why don't they just go ahead and mix key lime pie with chocolate cupcakes and see how that works out if thats what they think
11/25/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: Also I got my test back
11/25/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/25/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: I'm glad my professor got my joke in question 8
11/25/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: üòç
11/25/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: I love that
11/25/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: I love love love SCOOPIE I don‚Äôt care how it‚Äôs made
11/25/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: All I care about is getting more of it
11/25/19, 5:29 PM - Marianna: Hopefully soon
11/25/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: SO SOON
11/25/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: Wow I'm amazed I'm dating the only other person who likes scoopie
11/25/19, 5:44 PM - Caleb: It's honestly iconic commons cuisine
11/25/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Wow what are the odds
11/25/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: 1/2000 pretty much
11/25/19, 5:48 PM - Marianna: Congrats?
11/25/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: Match made in heaven
11/25/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: So, what are you up to?

11/25/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Also ahahaha might be a good call
11/25/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: Honestly I'm hoping Sarah and I can hang out a bit next semester
11/25/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: She seemed like someone I'd really get along with
11/25/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Yeah that totally works
11/25/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: Honestly wild concept you have like a library to go to
11/25/19, 7:20 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve just been in my apt

11/25/19, 7:44 PM - Caleb: Drew is a common pangloss
11/25/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre gonna have to stop bringing him up in bed
11/25/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: I'd call him a tool, but tools are useful
11/25/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Marc Todd is malicious
11/25/19, 7:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not gonna be able to look him straight in the face
11/25/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Who, Marc or Drew

11/26/19, 9:18 AM - Marianna: Gouda morning
11/26/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: Hi! Good morning
11/26/19, 9:28 AM - Caleb: How are ya
11/26/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: Hi
11/26/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good
11/26/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: I should be up by now
11/26/19, 9:43 AM - Marianna: But my bed caleb it‚Äôs so nice and warm
11/26/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: Ah but it'd be nicer and cozier if I was in it
11/26/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: (see ya in 3 days)
11/26/19, 10:12 AM - Marianna: Yeah but now I‚Äôm not even in it
11/26/19, 10:12 AM - Marianna: Is a bed cozy if there‚Äôs no one to be cozy in it?
11/26/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Like the whole tree paradox
11/26/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: Update
11/26/19, 10:13 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm listening to Christmas music on the way in today because it‚Äôs less than a month till Christmas and thanksgiving doesn‚Äôt exist in Europe
11/26/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: A bed can absolutely be cozy if nothing is in it
11/26/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: No one*
11/26/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: It's got potential cozy energy
11/26/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: And when you climb in, it's converted to kinetic cozy energy
11/26/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: Or maybe static cozy energy
11/26/19, 11:28 AM - Caleb: That might be more accurate
11/26/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I like this metaphor
11/26/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Almost as much as I like you
11/26/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been
11/26/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Aw
11/26/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Thenk ya
11/26/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: And it's been decent
11/26/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: It started with me messing up putting in contexts and it went behind my eye
11/26/19, 12:20 PM - Caleb: Which wasn't super fun
11/26/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: And then I was like 15 minutes to class because I couldn't see out of my left eye while biking in
11/26/19, 12:21 PM - Caleb: BUT HE GOT US PASTRIES IN CLASS!
11/26/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: And then in class I got my project working with like 74% accuracy, and Derek got it up to 94% so I'm pretty happy
11/26/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: And we might expand it because we have a week left to work on it
11/26/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: And then I had a guest lecturer in my history of Copenhagen class, and I thought it was super interesting because we talked about the future
11/26/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: And now I'm hanging out and just doing light work and looking at sweaters
11/26/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: What about you?
11/26/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Uh is your eye okay
11/26/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Are you eye-okay mate?
11/26/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: Hahahahaha
11/26/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm hilarious
11/26/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: We just got out of class and I‚Äôm currently at auchan with robin which is basically the Walmart by school
11/26/19, 1:26 PM - Marianna: I bought Christmas socks
11/26/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: And Christmas candy
11/26/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like a special traditional type in Hungary
11/26/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre coconut flavored
11/26/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: But hey congrats about the project!!!!
11/26/19, 1:27 PM - Marianna: I have to go home and do my paper ah
11/26/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm kind of mad at sarah I am starting to think we don‚Äôt live well together and a little worried about next semester I think our method of planning our schedules and managing our time  and we‚Äôre a little fed up with how the other deals with all that I think
11/26/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: HA
11/26/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Oh and also a part of my fake tooth chipped off yesterday, so you get to see that on Friday
11/26/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: And ahh I'm sorry
11/26/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: Thats stressful
11/26/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: I think that happens to everyone at a certain point though, living with someone is just challenging no matter what
11/26/19, 2:46 PM - Caleb: What about it bothers you?
11/26/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôd you do to chip your fake tooth?
11/26/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just falling apart over there
11/26/19, 2:52 PM - Marianna: Literally
11/26/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Like she prioritizes certain things so when it would be convenient for her to do things it‚Äôs not convenient for me and vice versa
11/26/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: And I cooked over the weekend and she hasn‚Äôt really been in the apartment because her parents have been here but she‚Äôs still gonna eat what I cooked tonight and tomorrow so I was like can you clean the kitchen?  And she was like well idk when I will I have work and it‚Äôs like yeah um and I don‚Äôt?  And I cooked?
11/26/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: So like things like that mostly
11/26/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: And kind of got in a mini fight yesterday but I can tell you about that one another time
11/26/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs just living with your friend for 3 months at some point you‚Äôre gonna get a little tired of each other
11/26/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Or just like insignificant things are gonna annoy the other person
11/26/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: But whatever we‚Äôll be fine
11/26/19, 2:57 PM - Marianna: But i just want to go home more this week than before
11/26/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: Idk
11/26/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: A piece just came off yesterday and I was like "oh hello"
11/26/19, 3:28 PM - Caleb: And yeah my eyes are still having a really rough time
11/26/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: All lights currently have halos around them
11/26/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: And the world looks really hazy
11/26/19, 3:34 PM - Caleb: And I'm really sorry that's happening
11/26/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: Honestly I think roommate relationships have a spot where things just go to shit
11/26/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: But once you get over that, life is good again
11/26/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: I mean hey, look at Matt and I
11/26/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: We were actually friends again at the end of the year
11/26/19, 3:35 PM - Caleb: But you only have to live with her for a few more weeks, and its break
11/26/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: Then after break, I'll let you hang in my room if you guys are still in conflict :)
11/26/19, 3:36 PM - Caleb: And besides, a lot of issues like cooking and cleaning won't be there next semester, so I think it'll get better anyway
11/26/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Oof
11/26/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Stop falling apart then
11/26/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs weird
11/26/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: And hey maybe take the contacts out and just wear glasses the rest of the day?  I know that helps when I mess up my eyes in the morning that‚Äôs the only thing that will allow them to basically reset
11/26/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's the plan
11/26/19, 3:49 PM - Caleb: I just need to go back
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Marianna: Update THe SUN Is sEtTInG I AM NoT OkaY WiTH ThiS
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: I'm at the library working rn
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: Hey hey hey
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: Guess what
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: The sun already set here, welcome to my lovely life
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: But it just means that you have a pretty sunset, then can enjoy some Christmas lights
11/26/19, 3:50 PM - Caleb: (I hope)
11/26/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: Are you  at the black diamond or a dis library?
11/26/19, 3:59 PM - Marianna: And yeah I can‚Äôt really see the sunset with all these gosh darn buildings
11/26/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: They did set up a new ‚Äúboldog kar√°csony‚Äù sign in the square
11/26/19, 4:00 PM - Marianna: That means happy Christmas
11/26/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: They celebrate Christmas like the gift part on December 6 here
11/26/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: St nicks day
11/26/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: Currently we're in a 5th floor lounge of our building
11/26/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: So neither
11/26/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: We couldn't find a spot at the library to all work
11/26/19, 4:03 PM - Caleb: WHAT
11/26/19, 4:04 PM - Caleb: THAT MEANS YOU GET CHRISTMAS PRESENTS!
11/26/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Well no not really
11/26/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: There‚Äôs not really anyone to give presents to me here
11/26/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll get the group to do a secret Santa
11/26/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm gonna give sarah stuff when we get back to davidson
11/26/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: It involves me painting things for her
11/26/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: I like making gifts for people so watch me just painting up a storm
11/26/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: I think she‚Äôll like them
11/26/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Ooo
11/26/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Am I allowed to hang out with you while painting
11/26/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Kinda like the time you mod podged the cooler
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Yay
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: I may end up volunteering to do my littles coolers for their littles this year
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm at least probably gonna offer
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: Wow you like painting, don't you?
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: But that could be up to 4 coolers so it depends
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: And yeah
11/26/19, 4:17 PM - Marianna: Coolers are fun
11/26/19, 4:18 PM - Marianna: I miss my warner fam
11/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: If you need any help let me know!
11/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: I enjoy being handy
11/26/19, 4:24 PM - Caleb: Even if it means just holding the cooler while you mod podge it up
11/26/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: Also oh my gosh
11/26/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: I'm having so much fun on this project
11/26/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: Its fun collaborating with people who actually are so good at what they do
11/26/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: Its been fun just being able to be super creative and worrying about how to do it afterwards
11/26/19, 4:27 PM - Caleb: Like we had to host a 350mb file on github
11/26/19, 4:27 PM - Caleb: But it wasn't working because they have 100 mb file size limit
11/26/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: so what I did was literally split it up into 8 50mb files and wrote a script to just merge them
11/26/19, 4:28 PM - Caleb: And it was so dumb
11/26/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: but it works well
11/26/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: So its the best type of dumb
11/26/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: And also I've been doing all sorts of things that sound so stupid or mundane but I'm enjoying it
11/26/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Hey you'll appreciate this!
11/26/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: Maybe
11/26/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: But things like I made a full 'requirements.txt' file that you can automatically download dependencies from
11/26/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: And created a .gitignore for the notebook checkpoints things don't make conflicts when we merge
11/26/19, 4:32 PM - Caleb: This feels so stupidly professional and I'm loving it
11/26/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs all crazy impressive
11/26/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having fun with your homework
11/26/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: Always nice when that happens
11/26/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: And I will for sure take you up on the being handy offer
11/26/19, 4:41 PM - Marianna: But I might make you hold me up because when I paint on my floor, my posture gets awful so I need someone to remind me to straighten my back every once in a while hahaha
11/26/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: Ahahahaha
11/26/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: I can probably do that
11/26/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: Final result is 94% accuracy with a super low loss
11/26/19, 5:27 PM - Caleb: It's been a good night
11/26/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: Time to head home and get food
11/26/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: How's your night been?
11/26/19, 6:03 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt get admissions fellow
11/26/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: I'm so sorry
11/26/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: How are you doing?
11/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: But hey I‚Äôm proud of your code
11/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs not the best night
11/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm not crying so that fine
11/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm about to go grocery shopping
11/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: It just sucks I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get it
11/26/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs my ego talking because ego thinks we deserve everything
11/26/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: But sarah had a good point they are building a team and I just wasn‚Äôt what they needed whether they liked me or not. It‚Äôs not a bad thing about me if my skill set isn‚Äôt what complements their needs
11/26/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Sarah is spot on
11/26/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: You're more than qualified, even if it's not this exact fit
11/26/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: I'm still really proud of you, as is everyone else
11/26/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: I know we talked last night, but if you want to talk tonight let me known
11/26/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: It's always a pleasure
11/26/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Also sorry I've been MIA, I've been panic cooking for our friends giving
11/26/19, 7:45 PM - Caleb: Hi I miss you and can't wait to give you a massive gosh darn hug
11/26/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: üòä
11/26/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: Thank
11/26/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: Can‚Äôt wait for that hug
11/26/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: AITs throwing a thanksgiving dinner for us Thursday and we‚Äôre bringing Side dishes so I‚Äôm gonna be cooking for that tomorrow
11/26/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt worry I have things to do so i shouldn‚Äôt even be on my phone...
11/26/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: But what are you cooking?
11/26/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôd love to talk but I have an early and long day tomorrow and I need to do much more on my paper so probably won‚Äôt be able to but I‚Äôll let you know if I get it all done early
11/26/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Stuffing and gravy!
11/26/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: THEY TURNED OUT SO WELL AND I WINGED EVERYTHING
11/26/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: I love cooking honestly
11/26/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Also hi I really like you and really miss you
11/26/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: And may or may not be tipsy
11/26/19, 9:07 PM - Caleb: Thank God for Wednesdays

11/26/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Hi I like tipsy Caleb compliments
11/26/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre absolutely what sober marianna needs when writing a paper
11/26/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: But hey soon!
11/26/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm so so jealous of your wednesdays
11/26/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: My wednesdays suck :(

11/26/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Hey you
11/26/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Thanks
11/26/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: This essay is much harder to write than I thought it would be
11/26/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôm pumped about the topic but it‚Äôs so long and I haven‚Äôt written any paper in so long ughhhhh
11/26/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs 10 pages not even double spaced
11/26/19, 10:11 PM - Marianna: Ugh
11/26/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Do you want me to help?
11/26/19, 10:17 PM - Caleb: Freshman year I got rejected from Dr. Heyer and Dr. Campbell's synbio summer research thing
11/26/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: And I cried so hard
11/26/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: But jokes on them
11/26/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Ya boy is published because of it
11/26/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: And if you asked me in the moment, it was an awful fucking night
11/26/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: But looking back, I'm so glad I got shot down for the very thing they told me I should apply for
11/26/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: Hi I'm so excited for you to get your Christmas present
11/26/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: Part of me wants to give it to you in January so I can see you open it, but also that's always awkward for me
11/26/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: The other part wants you to have it for Christmas, but I guess I'm not going to see you before then
11/26/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Anyway
11/26/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Hi cutie
11/26/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/26/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: PUPDATE
11/26/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: hi cutie
11/26/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: (Both to you and Charlie)
11/26/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Bolth
11/26/19, 11:10 PM - Caleb: :)))
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: And hey Sarah got rejected from that freshman year too!
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Apparently char bear and puparoni were let out to run in the field
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: So now they're exhausted
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: And nah I‚Äôm at 6 pages so it‚Äôs bedtime I‚Äôve still got 3 days
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: AND WOAH
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Marianna: Ish
11/26/19, 11:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah I was totally pissed and hurt and cried the whole night
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: But honestly, probably the best thing for me
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Tired pups are good pups
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: If I got accepted I wouldnt have gotten the Penn gig
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Yeah no I totally think you‚Äôve gone farther than you would have been able to there
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: So HA Dr. Heyer and Campbell
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Caleb: In your face
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: You know I‚Äôm a big fan of things happening for a reason
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: And well of it makes you feel better I rejected THEM
11/26/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: how about them apples
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Shows you for literally telling me to apply and id be perfect and then handing me a fat R
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Ha
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: You showed them!
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Dr Heyer was so sad though it was low key hard to do
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Well fuck it
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: Wait they did that?
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs whack
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Who cares
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: No one!
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's the main reason I was pissed
11/26/19, 11:13 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre great!  I had a great summer because of it!
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Because they BOTH TOLD ME TO APPLY
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: IN PERSON
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: That makes no sense
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Sorry
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: BOLTH
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: BOLTH

11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Just keep it at Bolth
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Marianna: Yes

11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: But yeah
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Whack
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: But now I'm living the good life
11/26/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: Anyway

11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: But what else is new
11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh so tired pups
11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Physically or mentally or other
11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Mostly physically
11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: Other?
11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: Both
11/26/19, 11:15 PM - Marianna: What would other be?
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Bolth
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Oh
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: That makes sense
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Marianna: Spiritually maybe
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Or like unpinpointably
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: That's a good one
11/26/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Are you spiritually unwell mar
11/26/19, 11:17 PM - Marianna: No I‚Äôm pretty spiritually well I think
11/26/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Hooray
11/26/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Good to hear
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt go to church last week even though I could have been I‚Äôm done feeling bad about that for this week
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: GOOD
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: I mean good that you're done feeling bad
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: I slept instead and that was better for me mentally so what ya gonna do
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Send me to hell?
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Probably won‚Äôt
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Marianna: Please don‚Äôt
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: You know, I'm sure God forgives you for taking care of yourself
11/26/19, 11:18 PM - Caleb: He's a fan of that thing
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Body is a temple and whatnot
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Ah good point
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: But my man
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Have you even been to a Catholic Church
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: No
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: No I haven't
11/26/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Will I go next semester?
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: They don‚Äôt always seem to think taking care of yourself is what god wants
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Take the abortion thing
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Definitely better for some people to
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Or will I burst into flames since I'm a filthy protestant
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: But not okay according to Catholic Church
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Gee thanks Martin Luther
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: You probably won‚Äôt burst into flames
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: Fun fact
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: Jk ML is my guy
11/26/19, 11:20 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve almost passed out I‚Äôm church like 3 times and I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not gonna take it as a sign
11/26/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Also that abortion thing is whack
11/26/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: I'm so glad I've talked to my dad about it
11/26/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: You and your dad have talking about how Catholics have a whack abortion rule?
11/26/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: No no
11/26/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Or the bursting into fire
11/26/19, 11:21 PM - Caleb: Catholics not involved
11/26/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: Or ML
11/26/19, 11:22 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just confused
11/26/19, 11:22 PM - Caleb: My dad and I talked about abortion a few times
11/26/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Hearing an very religious doctor who was studying embryology say that life begins at around 9 weeks and he could see the rationale was very interesting
11/26/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: I didn't think I'd ever hear my dad support abortion in any form
11/26/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: But the I was
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs interesting
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Good on him
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I have or ever will talk about the catholic church‚Äôs views on abortion or just abortion in general
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: With my parents that is
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'd love to talk with you about it though
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: But they‚Äôre also not doctors so it wouldn‚Äôt be as cool of a convo
11/26/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: If you're okay with that
11/26/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: Yeah I can imagine that's uncomfy
11/26/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: Idk I don‚Äôt have a ton to say about it but sure
11/26/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: How are you on this fine night
11/26/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Well
11/26/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Drunkish and full of turkey
11/26/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: And sweet potatoes
11/26/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: And garlic bread
11/26/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: And I got a bunch of compliments on the stuffing and gravy so I'm happy
11/26/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: So I gotta say I'm petty swell
11/26/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: That does sound pretty swell
11/26/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: I get turkey Thursday
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: But Mar
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: This isn't any turkey
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd better have my paper written before Thursday because I will for sure be catatonic after
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: This is H O M E M A D E turkey
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Uh
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: How do you homemake a turkey
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Don't worry 'bout it
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Got gotta do what you gotta do
11/26/19, 11:28 PM - Caleb: Ya know
11/26/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Also I still have the hot take that 'Farmer Refuted' is the best song
11/26/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: That's some EXCELLENT counterpoint
11/26/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: It reminds me of the songs I used to write
11/26/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Except way way better
11/26/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: You wrote songs?!?!
11/26/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: I did NOT know this
11/26/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: I will request more details
11/26/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Please
11/26/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: And yes it‚Äôs a good song
11/26/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm not gonna accept it the best
11/26/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah I used to write fuges and other duets for violin
11/26/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: I wrote a piano concerto once and it was REALLY good
11/26/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: I called it "Ares" after the god of war
11/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: The idea was that it was a counterpoint where the violin and piano were dueling
11/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: And uh okay Ms. Hamilton what's the best then
11/26/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Oooooh that‚Äôs so cool
11/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Also oh my gosh does this mean I'm dating a Hamilton girl?
11/26/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Oh god
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: And burn or satisfied
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Or maybe guns and ships if I‚Äôm feeling it
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: And yes
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Get over it
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Nope
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: And I wasn‚Äôt even a fan of hamilton before it was cool
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: No way
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: I jumped on the bandwagon
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: I'll take that
11/26/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm a musical gal so it‚Äôs not like the only musical I know is hamilton
11/26/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: I disliked Hamilton before it was cool
11/26/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: I think that gives me some credit
11/26/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Like, I heard about it from Carissa Warren as soon as it came out
11/26/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: And she was like "LISTEN TO THIS"
11/26/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: And I was like "yeah kinda cool I guess, maybe I'll learn about this in apush next year"
11/26/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: And then Nicole Henric couldn't stop talking about it and I hated it
11/26/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Look
11/26/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: My friends tried to get me into it but then I was like no
11/26/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: All I'm saying is that Farmer Refuted has this
11/26/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Idk how I eventually bent to the pressure
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: But once I heard it once I was like this is great
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Nonna loves it too
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: - excellent counterpoint
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: - clever lyrics
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: - consistent melodies with varying lyrics
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: - meta references to the melody having a key change
11/26/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: - synced lyrics on the downbeat
11/26/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: - a traditional baroque styling in reference to Samuel Sabory's loyalties
11/26/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: That's all I got
11/26/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Also congrats, you're the reason I caved to Hamilton
11/26/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: You got me
11/26/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: This is a remarkable point
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: Lin is a genius
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: WAIT A SECOND
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Hey
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Hey you
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: AND AHHAHA I AM SO SORRY FOR YOUR DOWNFALL
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: but I‚Äôm also lowkey proud of myself and happy that you wanted to listen to it
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Did you ever listen to Adventures in Odessey
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: BOOOO
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: But I feel like I didn‚Äôt talk about it that much with you
11/26/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: No
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Like I thought it was out of the blue when you said you were listening to it
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: But you're quite persuasive
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: And no I have not
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: NOOOO
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Wow I‚Äôm _UNKNOWINGLY_ persuasive I like it
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Big part of my childhood right there
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: What is it?
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Yeah congrats
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: You have me wanting to do things to be able to have more to talk about with you
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Okay
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Ya got me
11/26/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: I have to go to sleep
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm flattered though
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: :-(
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: But SLEEP
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: goodnight!!!!
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: That one even had a nose.
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: But okay
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Goodnight
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: I'll talk to you tomorrow
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Miss you
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: And see you in 2 days and 20ish hours
11/26/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: :)
11/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: üòò
11/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: ü¶Ä
11/26/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
11/27/19, 7:31 AM - Marianna: Ow wow I‚Äôm exhausted I hate 9am classes
11/27/19, 8:07 AM - Marianna: Can wait to see ya is 2 days
11/27/19, 8:07 AM - Marianna: And what‚Äôs up with the crabs
11/27/19, 8:07 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt hate them
11/27/19, 8:07 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just curious about them
11/27/19, 8:58 AM - Caleb: It's just something me and my friends do to celebrate something
11/27/19, 8:58 AM - Caleb: It's in reference to something, but I promise it's better explained in person
11/27/19, 8:59 AM - Caleb: Like when Lee got into the Davidson in Washington program, he sent "ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄGOT INTO DAVIDSON IN WASHINGTONü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä"
11/27/19, 8:59 AM - Caleb: And people replied with "ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä"
11/27/19, 9:00 AM - Caleb: Also good morning
11/27/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Is it at all related to the glitch crab
11/27/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: And good morning
11/27/19, 9:02 AM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôve got class now I‚Äôll talk to ya in a bit
11/27/19, 10:46 AM - Caleb: Oh man
11/27/19, 10:47 AM - Caleb: I just got a smell that brought me way back
11/27/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: It's the crisp November air, and it reminded me of when I was a kid and we'd get up early to watch Saturday morning cartoons while our mom made pancakes
11/27/19, 10:48 AM - Caleb: And the door would always be open with a baby gate up so that we could have fresh air and Maggie wouldn't run out
11/27/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Awwww that‚Äôs such a good random memory
11/27/19, 10:56 AM - Marianna: Do you have any field studies today?  Or have your professors taken pity on everyone getting back to their normal groove of things?
11/27/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Also I only have 1(!) more page in my theory section of my notebook and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna make it another 2 weeks
11/27/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: So I think I‚Äôll just have to start writing in my Hungarian section because that‚Äôs the class I write the least in anyway
11/27/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: Yeah
11/27/19, 11:04 AM - Caleb: It's one of those good, entirely wholesome ones
11/27/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: We were also only allowed to play games on weekends, so sometimes we'd get up early and start playing Starfox or Mario or something
11/27/19, 11:05 AM - Caleb: And I've got one! Its to the medical museum though so it'll be fun
11/27/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: And also I think the whole "regular groove" thing is over
11/27/19, 11:06 AM - Caleb: I have a few classes that are just finished
11/27/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Also okay important question
11/27/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: What types of notebooks do you use
11/27/19, 11:10 AM - Caleb: Like, what ruling? Do you use one notebook for all subjects?
11/27/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: Oooh I miss playing mario in my basement
11/27/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: Oooooh I am so jealous
11/27/19, 12:23 PM - Marianna: And college rules if I can find them
11/27/19, 12:24 PM - Marianna: I used to have different notebooks but it‚Äôs much more convenient to me I have realized to only have one and just use a section for each so that‚Äôs what I do not
11/27/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: What about you?  Am I being judged rn?
11/27/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Only a little bit but I forgive you
11/27/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Also, okay, hypothetical question
11/27/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: Say you had a friendsgiving at your place with a bunch of people over
11/27/19, 12:34 PM - Caleb: And you personally do two of the big dishes while most other people brought soda or beer or something pre-made
11/27/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: And afterwards, some people put their dishes in the dishwasher but you and Robin end up washing most of them, as well as of the dishes used for cooking, even by other peoplle
11/27/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Meanwhile, Sarah, Hans, Josh, and a few others are deciding if they want to go to Instant but eventually all just go to bed while you're still doing dishes
11/27/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: And you get up in the morning, make breakfast, and there was one tray in the oven that you didn't do
11/27/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: And Sarah comes out, looks at you, and goes, "hey would you mind cleaning that pan now?"
11/27/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: What would you do
11/27/19, 12:41 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah and Sarah has been complaining in the past about how you don't do dishes
11/27/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Well did sarah use the pan?
11/27/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: The thing that sucks here is if you say ‚Äúwell I actually did most of the stuff last night‚Äîcould you?‚Äù
11/27/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: You look like you‚Äôre calling attention to what you did and wanting praise for it even though it‚Äôs a completely fair point
11/27/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd do it just to not get in a fight at the end of the day but I‚Äôd be ticked off
11/27/19, 12:53 PM - Marianna: Admittedly hosting takes a lot of the cleanup work
11/27/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Like if you offer your place you get stuck with cleaning up the trash as I have noticed
11/27/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: So like even though I didn‚Äôt drink all the bottle of wine or use all the cups, I still take care of them
11/27/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: But idk I‚Äôm sorry
11/27/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Remember you don‚Äôt have to live with these people for much longer
11/27/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: I just was like "oh yeah I can do that in a second" and cleaned it
11/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: Which took like 20 minutes
11/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: But yeah I just wanted to vent
11/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: Sorry
11/27/19, 12:57 PM - Caleb: Like yes I'm aware that hosting requires cleanup
11/27/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: But also she lives here too, and she was trying to decide if she wanted to go out while I was the one cleaning with a friend
11/27/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: It's just
11/27/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Uhh
11/27/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: Nevermind
11/27/19, 12:58 PM - Caleb: How's your day been? How are you?
11/27/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: OH MY LORD AND THEN HER ROOMMATE MADE HER A GRILLED CHEESE AND DIDN'T CLEAN ANYTHING AND SHE DOESN'T SAY A WORD
11/27/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: I'm done
11/27/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: Goodbye
11/27/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: Hey beep bop you‚Äôre awesome
11/27/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: You can always vent
11/27/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm here for ya
11/27/19, 1:28 PM - Marianna: And you are for sure not in the wrong here you literally just kind of got to worst flat mates I‚Äôm sorry
11/27/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt feel great still but it‚Äôs okay I was actually kind of on fire in theory which is great
11/27/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: And by on fire I mean I got some cool things right and still a lot wrong
11/27/19, 1:29 PM - Marianna: And hey you know what you need to do
11/27/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: You have to find her today and be like oh hey would you mind cleaning that pan up???? In your sweetest voice but also make it known you‚Äôre just imitating her pettiness
11/27/19, 1:32 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm gonna plan Brussels during mobile class today
11/27/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: HEY LOOK AT YOU
11/27/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: You were already hot, but now you're on fire?
11/27/19, 1:49 PM - Caleb: Goodness gracious
11/27/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: Also I'm not gonna do that
11/27/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: I'll just be good until she tries to actually start conflict
11/27/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: Then it'll be great
11/27/19, 1:50 PM - Caleb: Fireworks
11/27/19, 1:51 PM - Caleb: Also yay! I know you're super busy though, so if you want me to take some of it let me know
11/27/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: Oh dear you are too sweet kid
11/27/19, 1:55 PM - Marianna: I respect that
11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the smart and mature decisions
11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: Okay almost class time
11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: Drink some tea
11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: Nap
11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Marianna: Or do whatever makes ya happy
11/27/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: See ya in an hour
11/27/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: I'm in a museum actually!
11/27/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: But yeah
11/27/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Tryl
11/27/19, 2:01 PM - Caleb: Ttyl
11/27/19, 2:15 PM - Marianna: Can you‚Äôd send me to address of the Airbnb?
11/27/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: Getting from the airport to the city might be annoying üôÑ
11/27/19, 2:16 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll be happy to not fly Ryanair into airports that are not near the cities they claim to be near anymore
11/27/19, 2:17 PM - Caleb: Chauss√©e de Wavre 1280, 1160 Auderghem, Belgium
11/27/19, 2:19 PM - Caleb: Oof
11/27/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: 40 minute car ride
11/27/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Maybe we could get a train?
11/27/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: I also would be alright with splitting a taxi
11/27/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm looking at a train/bus combo and then metro to our Airbnb which doesn‚Äôt look too bad but ugh I hate spending like 15 dollars just to get from the airport
11/27/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: And I think Bruges makes sense saturday
11/27/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: There are options with that and we should probably buy our tickets sooner so can we call tonight for like 20 minutes?  My friends want me to go out and I still have this paper but this is also important
11/27/19, 3:44 PM - Caleb: Yeah absolutely
11/27/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: Done class yay!
11/27/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Heyooo
11/27/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Very nice
11/27/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Congrats
11/27/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Also I just biked across Copenhagen through all the streets that were filled with decorations and cafes and lights above the streets
11/27/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: And it hit me how much I'm gonna miss this place
11/27/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Awww that‚Äôs sounds like such a nice ride
11/27/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: Also I biked across the city and found a new way without needing to look at a map
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: And I was swerving around pedestrians and looking at lights
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: And just
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Man
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: I love this place
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm surprised how little lights I see everywhere like there are some for the Christmas market but it‚Äôs not as universal as at home I think
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm happy you love it
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good thing to be able to look around you and be happy
11/27/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: You think you‚Äôll visit again?
11/27/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Oh for sure
11/27/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: I want to come for Christmas again some day
11/27/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: I sincerely believe that this place is more excited and decorated for Christmas than NYC
11/27/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: And it's all so cozy and well done
11/27/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: I have never been to nyc for Christmas
11/27/19, 4:38 PM - Marianna: Have you?
11/27/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Well I guess I still know what it looks like it is iconic
11/27/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah I wish we had more in Budapest
11/27/19, 4:39 PM - Marianna: But maybe it just hasn‚Äôt all gone up yet
11/27/19, 4:40 PM - Marianna: Marti said that because advent only starts this weekend, things might only go up soon
11/27/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: I've been up there once or twice
11/27/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: But it was really long ago
11/27/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: And I keep thinking everything is up, and then every time I go through, there's more stuff
11/27/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: I'll try to take some pics for you
11/27/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: You know, if I'm gonna be in a place where the sun sets around 4, I'm glad it's so gosh darn pretty in the dark
11/27/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs such a good point
11/27/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Also
11/27/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm making scalloped potatoes for the potluck thanksgiving
11/27/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs an inside joke that whoever gets that job every year in the ghirardelli household has done something bad recently and had bad karma because they ALWAYS end up cutting themself
11/27/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: And well
11/27/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Another ghirardelli fingertip has fallen prey to the trap of scalloped potatoes
11/27/19, 6:28 PM - Marianna: Alas
11/27/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: Nooo
11/27/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: Don't do that
11/27/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: :(
11/27/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: Are you okay?
11/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Yes yes
11/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôd make a monty python joke here
11/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: Buuuuuut
11/27/19, 6:44 PM - Marianna: üòê
11/27/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: TIS MERELY A FLESH WOUND
11/27/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: There I did it for you
11/27/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Tis but a scratch!
11/27/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just a flesh wound**
11/27/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: Oh wow
11/27/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: I got two quotes in one
11/27/19, 7:00 PM - Caleb: That means bonus points
11/27/19, 7:00 PM - Marianna: But we‚Äôll I‚Äôm glad you at least know what I‚Äôm talking about
11/27/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Well
11/27/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Maybe
11/27/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: But that just sounds like confusing to me
11/27/19, 7:01 PM - Marianna: Confusion**
11/27/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Confusion?
11/27/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Like the proverbs of the old Chinese guy?
11/27/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: No
11/27/19, 7:04 PM - Marianna: Not that one
11/27/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Well shucks

11/27/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: And maybe
11/27/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: People want to go out
11/27/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: Idk why tonight of all nights
11/27/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: Idk if that‚Äôs gonna happen for me
11/27/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: And pumpkin I think what about you
11/27/19, 8:16 PM - Marianna: But like specifically mom moms pumpkin pie

11/27/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: I called my moms mom
11/27/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: Mom-mom
11/27/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: I know it sounds ridiculous
11/27/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs true
11/27/19, 8:22 PM - Caleb: Okay well same but my mom's, not your mom-moms
11/27/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: Also do you still want to call for a few minutes to work out transportation?
11/27/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  But can we in a little bit?
11/27/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: I just got off FaceTime with Cameron and adelle
11/27/19, 8:44 PM - Marianna: Ah I can‚Äôt wait to be back

11/27/19, 8:54 PM - Caleb: Yeah no problem
11/27/19, 8:57 PM - Caleb: What time does your flight arrive on Friday?
11/27/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: 8:40
11/27/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: :(
11/27/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: Ah

11/27/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: I just need to tell the host  when we'll be in
11/27/19, 9:23 PM - Marianna: Oh and we don‚Äôt leave until late Sunday...idk if we‚Äôd be able to store our stuff there or if we‚Äôd want to. I guess it is just backpacks
11/27/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Also...you can‚Äôt read my bio paper
11/27/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: It ruins Illuminae
11/27/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm gonna make you read that
11/27/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: Noooo!
11/27/19, 9:29 PM - Caleb: I really want to read it!

11/27/19, 9:30 PM - Caleb: Also I was just going to take my backpack with my on Sunday
11/27/19, 9:40 PM - Marianna: Ahhhh but honeslty I think you may think it‚Äôs such foolishness this isn‚Äôt my world and I don‚Äôt want criticism of it like I just want it to be my non-bio baby and I‚Äôm sure I messed up some phrase of specification or something
11/27/19, 10:11 PM - Caleb: Ah no worries
11/27/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: I wasn't going to criticise it, I just want to read it honestly
11/27/19, 10:12 PM - Caleb: It sounds really interesting and I'm sure you did a great job
11/27/19, 10:21 PM - Marianna: Ah maybe
11/27/19, 10:22 PM - Marianna: Call now or is later better for you?  It can‚Äôt be too long I need to shower and sleep

11/28/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: Good morning
11/28/19, 8:44 AM - Caleb: How's it going
11/28/19, 8:59 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs going
11/28/19, 8:59 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a rainy day in Budapest
11/28/19, 8:59 AM - Marianna: But I kind of like it
11/28/19, 8:59 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm just gonna be at school all day so that‚Äôs kind of nice I‚Äôll hopefully be able to snag a study room and listen to the rain
11/28/19, 9:00 AM - Marianna: But I brought my potatoes in and realized they have no oven here to warm them up...so we‚Äôll see how that goes
11/28/19, 9:03 AM - Marianna: Wait what‚Äôs your answer to the what kind of notebook do you use for class
11/28/19, 9:04 AM - Marianna: I know about the cool chem notebook paper but in general
11/28/19, 10:11 AM - Caleb: Hey its a rainy day here too!
11/28/19, 10:11 AM - Caleb: Super comfy
11/28/19, 10:12 AM - Caleb: And I know what you mean, but also I'm imaging you brought just whole, raw potatoes in for lunch and are gonna have to eat them like apples and it's cracking me up
11/28/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: And I use dot pads! It's like a grid paper but instead of lines, it's just a dot where every intersection would be
11/28/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: And I use a small one for each class
11/28/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: Oh yeah I think I did see these when we compared notes all that time ago
11/28/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: They‚Äôre cool
11/28/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: They might drive me crazy though
11/28/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôd want each letter to have it down box
11/28/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: Its own**
11/28/19, 10:51 AM - Marianna: And done class!  Now I just try to be productive for the rest of the day
11/28/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Ha
11/28/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Jokes on you I haven't gotten out of bed yet
11/28/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: .... It's probably not going to be a super productive day, is it
11/28/19, 10:52 AM - Caleb: Hey when's your Thanksgiving thing?
11/28/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt do any of the theory homework so I really need to do that by midnight
11/28/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: Awwww I am soooooo jealous
11/28/19, 10:53 AM - Marianna: And 6pm
11/28/19, 1:35 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 2:04 PM - Marianna: Update it‚Äôs nap time
11/28/19, 2:04 PM - Marianna: Paper is pretty much done!  Looks pretty good if I do say so myself
11/28/19, 2:04 PM - Marianna: But now nap and then theory
11/28/19, 3:45 PM - Caleb: hE dOeSnT eVEn gO hERe
11/28/19, 3:46 PM - Caleb: I'm glad I picked the right time to visit in order to get immortalized in AIT history
11/28/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: Also Ulf is defending his thesis right now, and I came to support him
11/28/19, 3:47 PM - Caleb: But now I'm bored to death
11/28/19, 3:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah you did it‚Äôs uncanny
11/28/19, 3:54 PM - Marianna: And what‚Äôs he talking on
11/28/19, 3:55 PM - Marianna: Or is it gonna go right over my head
11/28/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: I just woke up and I feel loopy
11/28/19, 3:56 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna get coffee
11/28/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: Coffee fixes all
11/28/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: And don't worry it's over my head too haha
11/28/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: Part of the reason I'm bored, but in an interested way if that makes sense
11/28/19, 3:59 PM - Caleb: It's about quantifying communities using this network architecture front-end he designed
11/28/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: Also wait a second so is that like painted on the wall? Like a graphic? If so, im so proud
11/28/19, 4:00 PM - Caleb: That basically means I did two study abroad programs in one semester, right?
11/28/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: I have coffee
11/28/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Sarah showed me a life hack of putting hot coco mix in coffee
11/28/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: And now
11/28/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Boy
11/28/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Am I loving it
11/28/19, 4:10 PM - Caleb: Isn't that called a mocha
11/28/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Kind of but not
11/28/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: Oh is it just like a marginal amount
11/28/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Like mocha they don‚Äôt just combine hot chocolate and coffee
11/28/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: It tastes like more chocolate than mocha
11/28/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs a photo on the wall like hung up on a clothes line but I think it‚Äôs fairly permanent they have photos up for like 15 years
11/28/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Hooray
11/28/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Look mom i made it
11/28/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Also hey

11/28/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: Hey random question, does your mom work on NCEP
11/28/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I miss you too
11/28/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: I had a moment today where I was like oh at least it‚Äôs Friday
11/28/19, 6:05 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs not
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Aw
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: That's the worst I'm sorry
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: And she works with ncep but not on it
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: What happened?
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: AH okay
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Caleb: Still cool
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Nothing in particular
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: And why‚Äôd you ask?
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: Ncep has an internship
11/28/19, 6:08 PM - Marianna: I applied to it last year
11/28/19, 6:10 PM - Caleb: At Ulf's reception I was talking with a few professors at UK, and they worked with atmospheric stuff
11/28/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: So I asked what datasets they worked with, and they mentioned NOAA
11/28/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: And then I was like "oh that's awesome, my girlfriends mom works on some reinference stuff for them
11/28/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: "
11/28/19, 6:12 PM - Caleb: And then we just got talking about all sorts of awesome stuff you can do with NOAA's public datasets
11/28/19, 6:13 PM - Caleb: PS your mom sounds awesome
11/28/19, 6:13 PM - Marianna: Yeah so she works for noaa technically and I think ncep is private
11/28/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: She works for the aviation and maybe fisheries wing so does coding for modeling for the graphics you can access online and tools the airports and airlines use when determining flight paths
11/28/19, 6:15 PM - Marianna: She is pretty awesome
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: Sometimes I don‚Äôt think so
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: But at the end of the day she is for so many reasons
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: One of them being her career and success as a mom at the same time
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: And I totally took for granted that I had a strong female in stem raise me
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: Like she‚Äôs the lead of her team
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: She's an absolute inspiration
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: Honest to God
11/28/19, 6:16 PM - Marianna: And was just promoted temporarily
11/28/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll tell her that
11/28/19, 6:17 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôll love you
11/28/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha please don't
11/28/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: I really want to meet her sometime
11/28/19, 6:18 PM - Caleb: (and your dad, but I feel like we might have less to talk about)
11/28/19, 6:19 PM - Marianna: I feel like you‚Äôd get along with my dad too
11/28/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: Well January maybe
11/28/19, 6:20 PM - Marianna: And they will be at davidson next semester hopefully at some point
11/28/19, 6:22 PM - Caleb: Awesome

11/28/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: That horrendously ironic
11/28/19, 6:31 PM - Caleb: Gotta love Devansh

11/28/19, 6:39 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Hey in 24 hours you‚Äôll be in Brussels!  And I‚Äôll be in the air!

11/28/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Done theory
11/28/19, 9:43 PM - Marianna: Devansh and I worked together on a pretty latex of it
11/28/19, 9:44 PM - Marianna: Okay now I gotta pack
11/28/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: I'm struggling to figure out what to pack
11/28/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Whenever I do this, I feel like I'm severely under packing
11/28/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: I'm just bringing some clothes and toiletries though
11/28/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Like ahhgg what else do I bring
11/28/19, 10:07 PM - Caleb: Also I'm still debating just skipping my last class tomorrow
11/28/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm not great at packing either
11/28/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: All I request is you remember saline
11/28/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm brining my little speaker
11/28/19, 10:30 PM - Marianna: And sarah told me not to bother bringing pjs
11/28/19, 10:32 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm leaving mine like an hour early
11/28/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: I've got the saline
11/28/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: They don't sell small bottles here for some reason
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: But what I did for Greece was bought travel spray bottles and put it in there
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: And it worked fine
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: If you're good with that
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: That works
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Also haaaa very nice Sarah
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Marianna: You know saline should also be allowed larger than 3.4 oz
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Also for some reason that genuinely makes me feel better
11/28/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Maybe it's because we both hate cutting class so much
11/28/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: And I'm glad I'm not the only one doing it
11/28/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Also yeah I know that, but sometimes it doesn't pan out like that
11/28/19, 10:35 PM - Marianna: I always travel with my full size saline
11/28/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: So I don't want to chance it
11/28/19, 10:35 PM - Caleb: Also hey hey hey

11/29/19, 8:41 AM - Caleb: Thanks guy I met last night!

11/29/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: SEND PICTURES

11/29/19, 2:03 PM - Marianna: Not really
11/29/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll always be worried about being late
11/29/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very realistic
11/29/19, 2:05 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôll be good
11/29/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: Well that's peachy
11/29/19, 2:08 PM - Caleb: What's your flight number?

11/29/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: I don't know but I really hope it means "zebra stripes"

11/29/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: So Ima go with gyrellokross
11/29/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Or something
11/29/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: Put some accents in there

11/29/19, 2:53 PM - Marianna: Excuse you
11/29/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: We say literally every letter in Hungarian words
11/29/19, 2:54 PM - Marianna: But sz is one letter

11/29/19, 4:01 PM - Caleb: It looks like too many for one bus

11/29/19, 4:03 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs not a fully functioning adult?

11/29/19, 4:06 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the assignment?
11/29/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Update bus has not shown up but there are a ton of BKK people here to chorale us into buses I believe
11/29/19, 4:07 PM - Marianna: Is that how you spell chorale?
11/29/19, 4:08 PM - Marianna: Like in this sense?
11/29/19, 4:08 PM - Caleb: Corral
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: Not the a capella group
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: And I'll explain the assignment to you when I see you
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Frat**

11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: Also not an a capella group
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: More chamber choir
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Caleb: I didn't want to be the one to say it
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: They know it too
11/29/19, 4:09 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs okay we say it
11/29/19, 4:10 PM - Marianna: Marion has some absolutely WHACK stories from chorale events
11/29/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: I don't even want to know man
11/29/19, 4:11 PM - Caleb: As far as I'm concerned it's one big orgy for vocal egos
11/29/19, 4:12 PM - Caleb: I've also heard theatre has literal orgies but that's a different matter
11/29/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: There apparently is an accident between here and the airport so all the buses are late
11/29/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: No drama has the orgys
11/29/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: Ah silly me
11/29/19, 4:13 PM - Caleb: How could I mix it up
11/29/19, 4:13 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre very much a hookup culture of their own though
11/29/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: Oh wait now I see your last text
11/29/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: Yeah
11/29/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: I love my friends
11/29/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: But not like that
11/29/19, 4:14 PM - Marianna: Anyway

11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Had to weasel my way on
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs so packed
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: On the plane!
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: The plain plane
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: So many people got left on the platform
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Oh good!!!!!

11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Wow
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Caleb: I can say with 95% certainty that I'll be in Charleroi soon
11/29/19, 4:15 PM - Marianna: Please just stick with 100
11/29/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Best I can do is 99%
11/29/19, 4:16 PM - Caleb: Maybe I'll thrown in an extra 0.9% if I'm feeling lucky
11/29/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm feeling lucky
11/29/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: So you‚Äôll be fine
11/29/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: Please
11/29/19, 4:19 PM - Marianna: Knock on some wood though
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: Sorry if I do that it might knock a screw loose
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: You know RyanAir...
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Ha love it
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Also
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: Jk, I'll be fine
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Caleb: See ya soon
11/29/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôd be amazed when you see the bag I packed into for this weekend
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: ... As innnnn
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Because technically my north face is too big
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: I won‚Äôt ruin it
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: hWHAT
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Oh gosh
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs too tall
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Also you know they never check backpacks, right
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: No one has ever had an issue
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: But I mean come on RyanAir
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Marianna: Yeah but remember the whole rule following thing
11/29/19, 4:21 PM - Caleb: Those are some realistic standards
11/29/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Ah yes, _that_ rule thing
11/29/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: Okay Javert
11/29/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: üòê
11/29/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: But yeah
11/29/19, 4:22 PM - Caleb: It's okay
11/29/19, 4:22 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm really good at efficiently packing when I need to when I have a bigger bag I just fill it with things I may need but don‚Äôt now if I will so a smaller bag is probably better for me anyway
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: Plus it was a fun puzzle
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: So how much room do you have for taking things back
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: None...
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: ... So I shouldn't have brought you a 8 foot stuffed bear?
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Darn
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: Well darn
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre gonna have to take that back with you
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Kidding kissing
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Kidding*
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: It's a stuffed dog
11/29/19, 4:23 PM - Caleb: Come on now
11/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Well my sweater on Sunday is bigger than the one I‚Äôm wearing now so I‚Äôll maybe have enough to not have to cram everything in here
11/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Sure...
11/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Sure...
11/29/19, 4:24 PM - Marianna: Oh Freud?  Is that you?
11/29/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: Well you know what they say about kissing
11/29/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: It's a slip of the tongue, my bad
11/29/19, 4:25 PM - Marianna: Your jokes truly are awful
11/29/19, 4:25 PM - Caleb: üòÅ

11/29/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: No full sentences
11/29/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: That would give me away
11/29/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: Hungarian**
11/29/19, 6:14 PM - Marianna: Magyarul if you will
11/29/19, 6:14 PM - Caleb: You sly dog

11/29/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: No not really
11/29/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: You do have a special talent at making the guessing game answer sound less cool whatever it is

12/1/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs still nice
12/1/19, 6:49 PM - Marianna: Thanks for sharing it with my hand when they got a little chilly
12/1/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: On the bus. Sitting next to a gal with a Nikon so I figured it was a good spot
12/1/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: Well it's apparently 40 minutes by car which goes straight to the airport
12/1/19, 7:01 PM - Caleb: And security takes about 30 seconds haha
12/1/19, 7:02 PM - Caleb: I think you'll be fine

12/1/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Are you there already?
12/1/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: And now I think it smells like my grandma's unwashed carpet
12/1/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Yeeeep

12/1/19, 7:05 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna watch that when I have wifi
12/1/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Fair
12/1/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: My b
12/1/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: But there's a piano in the airport and this guy is playing a medley of fun show tunes
12/1/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: Including christmas ones!
12/1/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Wait he just finished
12/1/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Hey hey no problem just saying I won‚Äôt be able to comment on it yet
12/1/19, 7:06 PM - Marianna: Also what should I listen to rn?
12/1/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I guess I can listen to my December songs or Christmas carols or sleep playlist or album or cozy playlist
12/1/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not sure what I want rn
12/1/19, 7:07 PM - Marianna: I think December because then I get to find out what‚Äôs on that playlist!
12/1/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt listened to it in a year!  That‚Äôs like part of what I find exciting about these things
12/1/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: DECEMBER!
12/1/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: And woah
12/1/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: I didn't even think about that
12/1/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: It's like a surprise every time it comes around
12/1/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Arabesque No. 1 by Rousseau
https://open.spotify.com/track/3KOSyr9WSD2x4l77k8k7Bo?si=I4ayHIJKRvmEN5OMMSk3Sg
12/1/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Here
12/1/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: That sound bolth one of my favorite piano pieces of all time, and also one that I super heavily associate with Christmas
12/1/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: I used to have a piano by a big windowsill in by basement, and it let me look out over our whole lawn and garden
12/1/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: And so one Christmas when I was a kid I got super fixated on playing this song, so I sat the piano and practiced and practiced for all of break
12/1/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: And by the time I got it decent at the end of break, it was the time of the winter that snow piled up and I had this glistening back yard to play to
12/1/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/track/2oak57hNkCV3GzbGC1LVH6?si=3w9NahP7SbeFAeGlgcAqdg
12/1/19, 7:15 PM - Caleb: Here that's a better one
12/1/19, 7:16 PM - Caleb: What's your December playlist called?
12/1/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: How much did you play piano?  Do you still?  Was it like a hobby or your mom made you take lessons?  Did you start piano and then go violin?  And what made you choose instruments?
12/1/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: And **december jingles
12/1/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: All my monthlies are the ones that start **
12/1/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I also have recently become aware you can make folders on Spotify
12/1/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt know how you can that yet so I group them with the ** so I can always find them easily
12/1/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: And I like this piano
12/1/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs very relaxing
12/1/19, 7:18 PM - Caleb: Wait have I not told you the Little House on the Prairie story
12/1/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: I mean when you say little house on the prairie story it rings a bell like you have but I don‚Äôt remember any details
12/1/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: So let‚Äôs say no
12/1/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Or yes
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: But please feel free to share again
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: You have too much backstory for me to remember all of it
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just too cool
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: And shit at storytelling
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: üòé
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Caleb: But okay
12/1/19, 7:19 PM - Marianna: Idk I like listening to you talk and tell stories
12/1/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: So when I was in 3rd grade, I read Little House on the Prairie with my mom
12/1/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: You know, the Laura Ingles Wilder book
12/1/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: And in the book, every night Pa would play the fiddle for the kids in front of the fireplace
12/1/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: And I absolutely LOVED it
12/1/19, 7:20 PM - Caleb: And I begged my mom to let me get a fiddle
12/1/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: I begged and begged and begged
12/1/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: So eventually she caves, but under the condition that I first take piano lessons to show I'm serious
12/1/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: And so I did
12/1/19, 7:21 PM - Caleb: And I LOVED piano, but still wanted to play the fiddle like Pa
12/1/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: So in fifth grade I picked up violin from the public school (which was kinda late but I caught up quickly), and got a private teacher like two years later
12/1/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: And then played piano throughout high school but stopped in college
12/1/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Sometimes I'll still just go and play around in the practice rooms though
12/1/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: I'm not very good anymore though
12/1/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: PS
12/1/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: 41 days
12/1/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: See ya soon :)
12/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: Oh I think I heard this
12/1/19, 7:27 PM - Marianna: My mom did the same to Joey when he wanted to join band
12/1/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: He started as saxophone but all the cool kids played drums so he wanted to switch and my mom didn‚Äôt really count that as band as saxaphone so she told him he could switch only if he also took piano
12/1/19, 7:28 PM - Marianna: And that boy has never touched a piano in his life
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: Ever played on the union piano?
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: And yay!
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Nonono
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not too many!
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: The union piano terrifies me
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: If you play you WILL be judged
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Or some people will get angry because they forgot it isn't a library
12/1/19, 7:29 PM - Caleb: Besides
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: When we had exciting things we were looking forward to when I was growing up we‚Äôd cut paper strips and staple them in a chain and then cut a link every day until it got shorter and shorter
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: I play for myself
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: I kind of want one now
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: I'm totally going to do that
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll make one when I get back to md
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: Yeah it'll be kinda hard to transport
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Caleb: That's an adorable and awesome idea though
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: And the paper would always be color coordinated
12/1/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: So Christmas was alternating red and green paper links
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Well I meant not Budapest
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: I also don‚Äôt know where to get construction paper in Budapest
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: And okay I respect that
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: But I like people playing in union as long as they‚Äôre not just fucking around and know they sound awful
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Also
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Have you seen mama Mia 2?
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Yes
12/1/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Yes I have
12/1/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Why?
12/1/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/1/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: I've got some unfortunate news though
12/1/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Waterloo by Hugh Skinner
https://open.spotify.com/track/0KGOBUQSvFzufIGbQabIxr?si=dbJ-eX_yQVSanxwo9MIZDQ

12/1/19, 7:32 PM - Marianna: Such a good song too
12/1/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: You may be thinking that's +1 to ```Caleb's movies ‚à© Mar's movies```
12/1/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: But unfortunately I was so intoxicated that I barely rember the plot
12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs you get the intersection character
12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Howd**
12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Oh
12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Don' worry about it
12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Well add that to the list then please

12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: Ah

12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: And yeah! In Cope actually
12/1/19, 7:34 PM - Marianna: And when did you see the second that you were so intoxicated?
12/1/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: It was a sleepover at Jenn and Meredith's
12/1/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Sam and I pulled our mattresses onto their floor and we watched Mama Mia 2 and ate snacks
12/1/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Oh those were the days man
12/1/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: Also
12/1/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

12/1/19, 7:37 PM - Marianna: I love jenn and Meredith
12/1/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: And oh god that makes me even more nervous?
12/1/19, 7:38 PM - Marianna: Can you send the rest of the photos?  Or we can just put them on Dropbox
12/1/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: Do you want me to send them now?
12/1/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Whatever‚Äôs easier for you
12/1/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: I'll put Veev's photos on Dropbox but I can send you the ones on my phone now if you want
12/1/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs easier for me to send you what I have
12/1/19, 7:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah same

12/1/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: And just got to the gate and it‚Äôs delayed
12/1/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: YESSSS
12/1/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: God my heart stopped
12/1/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: I'm so so glad you made it
12/1/19, 8:07 PM - Marianna: But I would not have made it if it was not and I didn‚Äôt do that and ah I‚Äôm like about to cry from ah I didn‚Äôt want to spend the night in Charleroi
12/1/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: Oh so out of breath and my heart rate is probably confusing the heck out of my Fitbit
12/1/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: Ah
12/1/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: Ah
12/1/19, 8:08 PM - Marianna: I was not ready to think about what would happen if I missed this flight

12/1/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: You'll love it
12/1/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: I went against my initial winter instinct
12/1/19, 8:11 PM - Caleb: I wanted to get a winter cologne with a dark rich chord
12/1/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: And it smelled like amber and spices
12/1/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: But then I was like wait
12/1/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: Year round
12/1/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: I need a springtime colone and I really liked how fresh my last one smelled
12/1/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: So I put it on the one arm that didn't have any of the other stuff on
12/1/19, 8:12 PM - Caleb: So now one half of me smells like a musty carpet and the other smells WONDERFUL
12/1/19, 8:13 PM - Caleb: Also I'm boarding right now
12/1/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Okay wait a second the musty carpet one is growing on me
12/1/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: What's going on here
12/1/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: Also yeah that makes sense
12/1/19, 8:20 PM - Caleb: I'd just wait and then pee when you board the plane
12/1/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: Interesting
12/1/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: Sounds good
12/1/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: Don‚Äôt let the musty one grow on you
12/1/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: And well sarah logic-ed me into peeing
12/1/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm good
12/1/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: And back at the gate
12/1/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: Hey
12/1/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna miss not being in the same country
12/1/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: I liked how fresh and also unique your last one smells like it‚Äôs a very caleb scent. There are definitely some people who I‚Äôm like woah you‚Äôre not so-and-so but you still smell like so-and-so and it freaks me out
12/1/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: And like now sarah smells like me because we use all the same shower stuff
12/1/19, 8:26 PM - Marianna: So it‚Äôs a little strange
12/1/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/1/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: That's always a little strange
12/1/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: You don't wear perfume, do you?
12/1/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: Also I think (and hope) you mean the opposite here
12/1/19, 8:29 PM - Caleb: If so
12/1/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: I'm really gonna miss not maybe being in the not same country as not you
12/1/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: ‚ù§Ô∏è
12/1/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: Okay, taking off
12/1/19, 8:30 PM - Caleb: Talk to you later!
12/1/19, 8:33 PM - Caleb: Update, still taxiing
12/1/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: And the lady next to me just asked the stewardess for fresh air
12/1/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Oh boy
12/1/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a loaded question
12/1/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Because there are like 3 answers
12/1/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: I technically own perfume but don‚Äôt wear it all that much like I don‚Äôt think it came to school with me
12/1/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: I have a traveler roll on perfume like it‚Äôs very nice I wish I had more of it I love how it smells
12/1/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: So I use that when I travel
12/1/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: And then at school I usually just have bath and body work body spray stuff
12/1/19, 8:35 PM - Marianna: I like that a lot
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: But I didn‚Äôt bring it with me to Budapest so I bought perfume here that I really like
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: Also we‚Äôre starting boarding!
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: And yes
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: The not not not not
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: I like being in the same country as you
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: Which I guess is a good thing
12/1/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: But safe flight and let me know when you land!
12/1/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: And next time you fly out of the far away airport
12/1/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: My stress levels are still through the roof
12/1/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Also my Fitbit says we slept for like 4 hours last night but I thought it was more
12/1/19, 8:47 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/1/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Also if I don‚Äôt get this GosH DArn BACkpACK off my shoulders one of them is gonna file their 2 weeks notice
12/1/19, 9:02 PM - Marianna: Oh man I just sat down and my butt hurts there is gonna for sure be a bruise man
12/1/19, 9:03 PM - Marianna: On plane!
12/1/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: Hi let me know when you land
12/1/19, 10:03 PM - Caleb: And I didn't realize how tired I was until I passed out on the plane
12/1/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: It's like any time I fly now I can just conk out instantly
12/1/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: It's magical
12/1/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Teleportation some might claim
12/1/19, 10:04 PM - Caleb: Also hey! I took that picture with John!
12/1/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: I was standing just to his right
12/1/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: Also uh yea ima need to keep an eye on that one üòé
12/1/19, 10:05 PM - Caleb: (kidding)
12/1/19, 10:06 PM - Caleb: Anyway, boy oh boy I miss being in the same place as you, but it's great to be back
12/1/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/1/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: It's my little music corner
12/1/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Caleb
12/1/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: I just landed
12/1/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: _IN THE SNOW_
12/1/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs snowing
12/1/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: And I couldn‚Äôt sleep idk what‚Äôs up
12/1/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: But I rested which is also good
12/1/19, 11:04 PM - Marianna: And awwww that looks hygge if I‚Äôve ever seen hygge
12/1/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: No YOU'RE hygge

12/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Ha
12/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Sorry
12/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Well now I have to stand outside and wait for a bus for 17 minutes
12/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: So you may have won
12/1/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Ah
12/1/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm ready to be home
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: And this time I just mean Mad√°ch Imre √∫t home
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Yeah taking the metro for 20 minutes and being home is great
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Gotta say
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: And yeah
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôm gonna dance to keep warm
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: But it sounds like you're ready to be home home too
12/1/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: And if there's a mirror within a 3 mile radius I'm gonna request a dancing selfie
12/1/19, 11:25 PM - Caleb: But I know there's probably not so I'll accept a rain check
12/1/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: No mirrors
12/1/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Plus I‚Äôm in full penguin mode currently
12/1/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: Scarf IN

12/1/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: waddle ENGAGED
12/1/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like those two words next to each other
12/1/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Like they make sense
12/1/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs a no from me champ
12/1/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Marianna WADDLING
12/1/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: is better
12/1/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: boots SHUFFLING
12/1/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: There we go
12/1/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/1/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Also look at this pic I got
12/1/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/1/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Yours in much better
12/1/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: I really do think you have the better phone camera
12/1/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Woah I recognize that!
12/1/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: Margit-sziget!
12/1/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: And honestly it isn't even as good as my old pixel
12/1/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: That thing was AMAZING
12/1/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: But you can see margitsziget, arpad hid, parliament (the really bright thing on the left of the river
12/1/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: Thats wild
12/1/19, 11:33 PM - Caleb: It's so weird that I can visualize the city so well from that
12/1/19, 11:33 PM - Marianna: Yeah I have heard people RAVE about the pixel camera
12/1/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: It's the whole thing we've talked about before where its one thing to hear someone say "oh I got home", but it's another to actually have been there and imagine what that means
12/1/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: And yeah, but wanna know something beautiful?
12/1/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: You have the camera
12/1/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: On your new
12/1/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Somehow
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: I figured out how to port the pixel software to my new phone üòé
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Through some illegal means I don‚Äôt want to know
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Bootleg
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: No k√∏
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: No no legal
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: What
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Really
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Impressive
12/1/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: On metro bus
12/1/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Geez
12/1/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: It's like you assume everything I do is illegal
12/1/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: No
12/1/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Not everything
12/1/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre just better at computer science
12/1/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Which allows you to do some illegal stuff I would only dream of
12/1/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: The only issue is that the pixel has a dedicated image processing chip, but Samsung has their proprietary line instead of Qualcomm
12/1/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: I swear I'm not actually a bad boy
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: üôÑ
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: I just follow my curiousity
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Okay sir
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Following orders
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Following curiousity
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Also I really don't think that's right
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Yeah just go with that
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt know how to port software
12/1/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: You have more practical experience
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah but you could E A S I L Y learn
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Wait let‚Äôs not fight about who‚Äôs better because I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll even come to a consensus
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Yeah you're right
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: :)
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: You're a smart one though
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: And that's attractive as hell
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Maybe
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Oof I just want to pass out
12/1/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: But I prob shouldn‚Äôt on this bus
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Are you home herb
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Yet?
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Yep!
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: I've got a nice cup of Chai tea
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Ah lucky
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Ohhhh
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: And I'm gonna shower and go to bed in a few
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the tea like
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: ... Warm?
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Is earl grey your favorite?
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Sweet
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Tastes like vanilla
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: But also with that lovely Chai twist
12/1/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Good chai it sounds like
12/1/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: And actually nope!
12/1/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: My favorite tea is ginger peach
12/1/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Ooooooh that sounds good
12/1/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: But like most of my favorite stuff, it's got an emotional connection behind it
12/1/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your favorite genre of tea
12/1/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Ah that‚Äôs sweet and good
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Yep
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: It's not that deep, I just used to always drink it with my mom
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: She'd put on a pot when I came home from school
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Or in the mornings
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Marianna: Still sweet and good
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Before I liked coffee
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: And ooooh
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Favorite genre
12/1/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: First off, definitely not herbal tea
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: It's gotta have tea leaves in it to call it tea
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Like actual leaves
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Are you opposed to tea bags
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: From a tea tree
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: No no
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: Herbal tea doesn't actually use tea tree leaves
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: So it's fake
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: This is a hill I'll die on
12/1/19, 11:43 PM - Caleb: It's like making coffee using something other than coffee beans
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: And being like "no its coffee"
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Because I‚Äôve seen something that‚Äôs like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use bags‚Äîit‚Äôs not tea unless you just put the whole leaves in‚Äù
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: Ew what no
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: There's loose leaf tea but that's different
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Hey I am not gonna fight you on this one
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Uh
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: Isn‚Äôt that the leaves
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: I just do loose leaf tea when I can because it's more environmentally conscious and also I can buy it in bulk
12/1/19, 11:44 PM - Caleb: They're not whole leaves though
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: Oh well that‚Äôs what I meant
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: It's just tea that doesn't have a bag
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: Still weird
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Nuh uh
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird I can hear you say your texts better rn than Thursday
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Hahaha not at all
12/1/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôve refamiliarized myself with your mannerisms and speak matters
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Manners**
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: I didn't think about it, but I think the same goes for you too
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Cool
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: We should do that more often
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Yuhuh
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: üòâ
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: I'm SO down
12/1/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: What are you doing January 12-May 20
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Because I think you should visit North Carolina
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: So anyway, long answer, I like black teas that have some interesting flavor behind them
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Much warmer than Copenhagen or pa
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah I sidetracked
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: And WOAH I've heard it's nice there
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: Cool
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: I think herbal teas are just dirty water
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Oh my lord my heart
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: You're too perfect
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Marianna: I also think non strong teas are also like that though so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/1/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Who are you
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm marianna
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Hi
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: üêß
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: I think that‚Äôs technically a pud√≠n
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Puffin
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: LMAO
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: That made me laugh out loud
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Yay good
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Say sorry to Reid for that
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: It's your fault if Hanne comes out and tells me to quiet down
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Nah I'm in the kitchen
12/1/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Oh no
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs worse
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Ah
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Pssh
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Who cares
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: I take it back
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Not me tbh
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Me neither
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: It's the beauty of it
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: I say screw them and live your LIFE
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Apparently she's really been on Reid's ass lately
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Good
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: ....
12/1/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Oh no
12/1/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: He was complaining about it tonight
12/1/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: And also he's got LOVE LIFE updates!
12/1/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: So I got all those when I came back
12/1/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh good stuff for him?
12/1/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs good
12/1/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: But his current girl is not the one that was potentially problematic that he stayed over or same girl?
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Nope
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: That was his ex
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Who visited AFTER they broke up
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Which is a big √∏l yike
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Fun fact, √∏l = beer
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: But anyway
12/1/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: Her name is Cassie
12/1/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Cassie was one of the people I went to Greece with
12/1/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: And she brought her boyfriend who I couldn't stand
12/1/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Wait I‚Äôm confused
12/1/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Reid has love life updates with Cassie who has a boyfriend?
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Is Cassie the girl he stayed over with though?
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Thats Cassie and Dane
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: In Greece
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Who broke up days after
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Oh darn
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Brutal
12/1/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: You know that whole "Instagram is hyper fake bullshit" rant i had a few weeks ago
12/1/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: Well exhibit. Fricking. A.
12/1/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: So Cassie and Reid hung out A LOT in the last month
12/1/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: And there was major tension
12/1/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: And Reid broke it off with his last person because it was a rebound situation and he wasn't comfortable with casually sleeping around because of just who he is
12/1/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: [Enter Cassie]
12/1/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: They hang out a ton together
12/1/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: She comes over all the time
12/1/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: I thought she was a pretty cool person, we got along really well
12/1/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: And Reid is like "ahaa yeah I could see it, but she has a boyfriend"
12/1/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: [Sad faces for our boy Reid]
12/1/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: And then we go to Greece (Reid didn't come)
12/1/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: And Cassie brings her boyfriend who seems and acts perpetually stoned
12/1/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: And they're fighting the whole time, almost ruins Greece trip because she projects all her anger on other people
12/1/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Bad time
12/1/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: They get me to do a couples photo shoot at the beach for them
12/1/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: And then BOOM they break up days later
12/1/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: And apparently Reid had his first official date with her this weekend
12/1/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: But he doesn't know how she acted in Greece, and I'm really not gonna tell him
12/1/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: Reid has the heart of a golden retriever, so pure~
12/1/19, 11:59 PM - Caleb: So anyway thanks for coming to my TED talk
12/2/19, 12:01 AM - Marianna: I would not have pegged Reid as wholesome golden retriever no offense to him
12/2/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: But hey good for him
12/2/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: I just hope he‚Äôs not HER rebound
12/2/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Although you usually don‚Äôt connect with your rebound pre breakup I guess
12/2/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm rooting for them
12/2/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Idk how people are starting full on relationships while abroad
12/2/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Or even just going on dates
12/2/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: I'm just shocked because we're here for 13 says
12/2/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: Days*
12/2/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: Like what the heck man
12/2/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: It's like the time I dated a girl for exactly one week
12/2/19, 12:03 AM - Caleb: But even less foresight
12/2/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: Yeah well to play the devils advocate you asked me out a month before school ended
12/2/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: Yeah
12/2/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: Not exactly the same but a little because at that point it wasn‚Äôt like we knew we‚Äôd see each other again for literally 8 months
12/2/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: But I was fully willing to stick around if it worked out
12/2/19, 12:04 AM - Marianna: Yeah well maybe Reid and Cassie are too
12/2/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: Who knows
12/2/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: I'm split because I don't really like Cassie and Reid genuinely deserves better
12/2/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: But I don't want to spoil something good for him
12/2/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: So I'm just gonna let it roll
12/2/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Also you gave waaaaay less of a reaction than I was hoping to that
12/2/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: I think I've told you the story but I swear it's a lot less bad than it sounds
12/2/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: I thought I‚Äôd heard about her
12/2/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: Yeah
12/2/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: It was like a week later you were like wait we don‚Äôt like each other
12/2/19, 12:06 AM - Marianna: Or something yeah?
12/2/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: This was the girl you stole from your friend and we‚Äôre like well darn now idk what to do
12/2/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: Or was that someone else
12/2/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm telling you
12/2/19, 12:07 AM - Marianna: HeaRtBReaKEr
12/2/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Wait what
12/2/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: No
12/2/19, 12:09 AM - Caleb: Very much no
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: It was my senior year of high school and we hung out a ton and then got really close, and then basically were dating by the summer
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: And then I was like "hey just so you know I don't want to go into college in a relationship"
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Wait are the other stories you or someone else
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: Not me
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Interesting
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt a clue who they are then
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: This one is me
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Caleb: Kinda
12/2/19, 12:10 AM - Marianna: Gosh now I want to know
12/2/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: Okay
12/2/19, 12:11 AM - Caleb: So to finish this story
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: It was a week before I left for Davidson, and I was just like "hey we've basically been going out for like 6 months, so do you want to just make it official and then break up when I leave"
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: And we did
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: And it was a week
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: And then I made the mistake of a rebound
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: üôÉ
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Caleb: This one is a different story
12/2/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Oh okay I was like I remember talking with you about that on my bed in dc on the phone like if that memory wasn‚Äôt real id be confused
12/2/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: I'll save it for another time though, I think I'm gonna go to bed
12/2/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: How close are you to home?
12/2/19, 12:13 AM - Caleb: And I'm sure I've given you my whole dating history at some point
12/2/19, 12:14 AM - Caleb: But I think it was a long time ago
12/2/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: Home!
12/2/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna follow you to bed soon
12/2/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Ah
12/2/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: If only
12/2/19, 12:15 AM - Marianna: I mean I can still use the saying I feel like
12/2/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: Yeah
12/2/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: But it'd be awesome if you actually did
12/2/19, 12:16 AM - Marianna: Yes
12/2/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Goodness gracious I need a snow day tomorrow so I don‚Äôt have to sit in plastic chairs for 4 hours my tush is not happy
12/2/19, 12:17 AM - Marianna: Freaking ice
12/2/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Haa
12/2/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Comedy gold
12/2/19, 12:22 AM - Marianna: Update no bruise on butt but my elbow is starting to bruise and I wonder if this is why my neck hurt like if I hit my elbow hard enough to bruise it might has sent a shock up to that shoulder
12/2/19, 12:23 AM - Caleb: Well if you come back from a weekend with your boyfriend and complain about your butt being sore, you better push that story right away ;)
12/2/19, 12:23 AM - Caleb: Also, sleep album:
12/2/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: https://open.spotify.com/album/0U8DeqqKDgIhIiWOdqiQXE?si=2Gv26wRHSmSekaSLLntHaw
12/2/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: When you first suggested doing the album of the week thing, this one INSTSANTLY came to mind
12/2/19, 12:24 AM - Caleb: I'm amazed it took me so long to remember it
12/2/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: Yeah I told sarah
12/2/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: And I was good to clarify
12/2/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: Ryan was also on FaceTime so he got to see my hickey too
12/2/19, 12:26 AM - Marianna: And yay!

12/2/19, 12:27 AM - Caleb: It's one of my favorite albums of all time
12/2/19, 12:27 AM - Marianna: Not necessarily in that order
12/2/19, 12:27 AM - Caleb: Okay, sounds good
12/2/19, 12:27 AM - Caleb: I think I'm gonna head to bed
12/2/19, 12:27 AM - Caleb: Goodnight!
12/2/19, 12:28 AM - Caleb: Thanks again for coming with me, I had an awesome weekend with you

12/2/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: Like I wish I could say and express more at how great a time I had but I can‚Äôt just because I don‚Äôt know where to start like wow it was an adventure
12/2/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: Goodnight
12/2/19, 12:30 AM - Marianna: Sleep tight

12/2/19, 7:45 AM - Marianna: Update snow turned out o be rain
12/2/19, 7:45 AM - Marianna: Which means I have to get up and I‚Äôm not feeling that

12/2/19, 8:42 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 10:14 AM - Caleb: Ooo

12/2/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: Then I passed out for another hour
12/2/19, 10:15 AM - Caleb: It was delightful
12/2/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm jealous
12/2/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: I still technically slept in
12/2/19, 10:49 AM - Marianna: And then scrambled to get to school
12/2/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: Ah
12/2/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: That sounds like a decent tradeoff honestly
12/2/19, 11:50 AM - Caleb: Oh hey did you like the album last night?
12/2/19, 1:01 PM - Caleb: Haaa
12/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: My Hungarian friend just showed my other friend a picture and was like "ah this is what it looks like at home right now"
12/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: And I was like "oh is this the snow?" and he laughed and was like "yeah its cruel that we're in Scandinavia and it's sunny"
12/2/19, 1:02 PM - Caleb: (he's from Budapest)
12/2/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: Yeah the fact that the train was stopped covered for my sleeping in
12/2/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: And hey!
12/2/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/2/19, 1:16 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs true
12/2/19, 1:17 PM - Marianna: But at least you had sun
12/2/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: And well to be honest I don‚Äôt remember it at all
12/2/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Just about passed out as soon as I was under the cover
12/2/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: And oh my bed and my fuzzy blanket and my pig were saying don‚Äôt get up this morning
12/2/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna go get some lunch (open face warm cheese sandwich) and then nap during my 2-4 class time (we don‚Äôt have class today because he is traveling this week‚Äîin Brussels actually!)
12/2/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: Woah
12/2/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: My med ethics just had its last class
12/2/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: And I didn't realize until we got out
12/2/19, 2:40 PM - Caleb: I'm actually kinda sad

12/2/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: Booo
12/2/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: No fun
12/2/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: I just got back and boy it's been interesting
12/2/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: How are ya
12/2/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: OH MY GOSH
12/2/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: MAR
12/2/19, 6:33 PM - Caleb: I JUST LEARNED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING
12/2/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: See that island in the middle?
12/2/19, 6:34 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: It's called "Saltholm"
12/2/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: It's a natural island, been there for a long long time
12/2/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: However, when a bridge was being built between Copenhagen and Malm√∂, there needed to be an intermediary point
12/2/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: So we built another island
12/2/19, 6:35 PM - Caleb: That island's name you ask?
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Peberholm
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Marianna
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: _PEPPER HOLM_
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: _SALT AND PEPPER_
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: üò±
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: IT'S BEAUTIFUL
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: So cute
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Making islands have friends
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre clever those danish Swedes
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Or Swedish Danes
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Caleb: Indeed
12/2/19, 6:36 PM - Marianna: Or whoever did it
12/2/19, 6:37 PM - Marianna: Did you learn this in history of Copenhagen?
12/2/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: Sorta
12/2/19, 6:37 PM - Caleb: I'm writing this scifi story and wanted to do something with the island, so I looked it up on the map and noticed it
12/2/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs cool
12/2/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Random q
12/2/19, 7:03 PM - Marianna: Does your camera collect gps info
12/2/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: It gives me the option to do it through my phone
12/2/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: I said yes while I'm abroad, but I turn it off at home
12/2/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: I don't want my address in the EXIF tags
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Ah you see so your camera is better than mine. I‚Äôm trying to solve a mystery currently because about half of the photos from my and my moms d7100s have location info that‚Äôs pretty detailed
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt see a pattern of which ones are
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Besides before August 2017
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Which seems really arbitrary
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: Unless that was when I switched laptops
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: But idk
12/2/19, 7:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm jealous of you and your app
12/2/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Well I'm jealous of you and Andiamos full frame CMOS so HA
12/2/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
12/2/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: But that's weird
12/2/19, 7:14 PM - Caleb: Sounds like you should write custom firmware for him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/2/19, 7:25 PM - Marianna: Okay
12/2/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: It doesn‚Äôt have it built in so we don‚Äôt know the gps data got associated
12/2/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: But whatever
12/2/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: How are you?  What have you been up to today?
12/2/19, 7:31 PM - Caleb: Is the GPS specifically from where you took the Pic? Or is it usually your house
12/2/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: And I'm good! I'm gonna cook with Hannah in a bit
12/2/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: Love some tacos
12/2/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: And I had a beer while I was writing, and boy I forgot I hadn't eaten a whole lot so I'm surprisingly buzzed
12/2/19, 7:32 PM - Caleb: But it's comfy and writing has been fun
12/2/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: Oh and I had a really interesting lecture today
12/2/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: But I'll tell you in a bit
12/2/19, 7:33 PM - Caleb: I'm shopping rn
12/2/19, 8:17 PM - Caleb: Okay so it was a lecture by Anders, my history of cope professor
12/2/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Which wouldn't usually be odd, but it was in my cancer class
12/2/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Apparently he had a lymphoma back in 2013 and talked about his experience today
12/2/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: No it‚Äôs mostly in my travel photos that I notice it
12/2/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: How was shopping?
12/2/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: And woah cool crossover I guess
12/2/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: How many different classes are there?  Like it is as many offered as davidson?
12/2/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: Definitely not as many as Davidson
12/2/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: But it's a good amount
12/2/19, 9:12 PM - Caleb: Probably like 150 or so
12/2/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: Woah
12/2/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: We had like 20
12/2/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: If that
12/2/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: How are/were the tacos!
12/2/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah it's nice to have options
12/2/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: And shopping was okay
12/2/19, 9:16 PM - Caleb: It was just groceries
12/2/19, 9:16 PM - Marianna: Ah
12/2/19, 9:17 PM - Marianna: Eggs?
12/2/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: Taco stuff!
12/2/19, 9:19 PM - Caleb: The tacos were pretty good actually
12/2/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Also I've figured it out
12/2/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: I don't like to have a beard if I have short hair
12/2/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Or at least not a full beard
12/2/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Stubble or trimmed is the way to go
12/2/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Also I'm procrastinating by cleaning the bathroom
12/2/19, 9:20 PM - Caleb: Help
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Call me dumb but I don‚Äôt know what the difference between trimmed and full
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: Well like I know full is more
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: But like what would you say you had this past weekend?
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: And well
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs not the worst form of procrastination
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt done anything today
12/2/19, 9:29 PM - Marianna: (Also if you need to procrastinate feel free to send me those Belgium photos on veev)
12/2/19, 9:35 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Trimmed is kept short and neat
12/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: Full is just let it grow and it gets a little fluffy
12/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: It wasn't like a full full beard, but it wasn't trimmed
12/2/19, 9:39 PM - Caleb: I'd say it was closer to trimmed last weekend, but it definitely had hairs sticking out
12/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: Also yeah! I'll do that now
12/2/19, 9:40 PM - Caleb: Or at least start the upload
12/2/19, 9:42 PM - Caleb: And hey that looks pretty good!
12/2/19, 9:46 PM - Marianna: Cool
12/2/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: I think I probably like it when you have it more trimmed but I also don‚Äôt know and you also shouldn‚Äôt care what I think you can look how you like!
12/2/19, 9:47 PM - Marianna: (You also didn‚Äôt ask but yeah that‚Äôs it)
12/2/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 9:48 PM - Marianna: If I do say so myself
12/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah well I've decided that I don't like to be completely clean shaven because I look so young
12/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: And I don't like having a scraggly beard at all
12/2/19, 9:51 PM - Caleb: So lucky you, trimmed is what ya get
12/2/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: And oooooo
12/2/19, 9:52 PM - Caleb: I love stir-fry

12/2/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: And an oven
12/2/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: Does little have kitchens?  I feel like someone said they do on every floor
12/2/19, 10:25 PM - Marianna: But that seems like too much for too little people
12/2/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: I know duke does on the first floor
12/2/19, 10:27 PM - Marianna: Idk about an oven
12/2/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: First floor has a community kitchen
12/2/19, 10:28 PM - Marianna: But new dorm does

12/2/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: I'm really going on this essay
12/2/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Story
12/2/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Story is a better word for it
12/2/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Want to read what I have?
12/2/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: As long as you promise not to judge me too hard
12/2/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: It's the first time I wrote fiction
12/2/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: And it's also weird because I'm writing it as an entertaining story I hope I'd want to read, but also it needs to be an expos√© of Reffen
12/2/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah!  I want to read it!
12/2/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: üòØüòØüòØ

12/2/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: Now I'm nervous
12/2/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: It's not good sci-fi
12/2/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: It's just kind of an assignment
12/2/19, 11:17 PM - Caleb: You've got high standards
12/2/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôll send ya my bio paper

12/2/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: But if you have any ideas let me know
12/2/19, 11:32 PM - Caleb: It's _approximately_ 1000 words but I'm feeling that's flexible
12/2/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: Hey
12/2/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: I just wanna let you know
12/2/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: You're so wonderful

12/3/19, 12:56 AM - Marianna: Never have I had a scarf so tight around my neck during FaceTime
12/3/19, 12:56 AM - Marianna: Vanguard got back with dates so I was asking his opinion on how to ask questions back to the lady
12/3/19, 12:57 AM - Marianna: Hey you‚Äôre wonderful
12/3/19, 12:58 AM - Marianna: Goodnight!!

12/3/19, 8:49 AM - Caleb: Also I just saw John Leiner's snap story about room assignment and ohohohooo
12/3/19, 8:49 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/3/19, 9:26 AM - Marianna: All the interview dates are after we start the semester (of course)
12/3/19, 9:26 AM - Marianna: So not yet it depends on some things but I asked the lady a bunch of questions last night to try to figure it all out
12/3/19, 9:26 AM - Marianna: And I don‚Äôt have him on snap. What was the story saying?
12/3/19, 9:27 AM - Marianna: Where is Meredith a hall counselor this year?
12/3/19, 9:27 AM - Marianna: and good morning!
12/3/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: WHAT THE HELL
12/3/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: I JUST LEARNED ANDERS ALSO DOES STAND UP COMEDY
12/3/19, 10:03 AM - Caleb: HE HAS THREE SOLD OUT SHOWS THIS MONTH

12/3/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: MOVIES
12/3/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: WHY DID HE WAIT UNTIL THE LAST CLASS TO TELL US
12/3/19, 10:04 AM - Caleb: I've learned so much about this man in the last 24 hours
12/3/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: He might not want his students to know you know?
12/3/19, 10:07 AM - Marianna: Is he funny in lecture though?
12/3/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: HE JUST TOLD US
12/3/19, 10:13 AM - Caleb: Also class is starting ttyl
12/3/19, 10:18 AM - Marianna: Yeah but like if you knew at the beginning of the semester you might go to a show or might ask him to do standup in class or something
12/3/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: Also idk it‚Äôs a fun thing to all of a sudden know about your prof
12/3/19, 10:19 AM - Marianna: Chartier is a mime. If you‚Äôre lucky he‚Äôll show some mime videos. He‚Äôs also kind of funny in an egotistical kind of way
12/3/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: WHAT
12/3/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: People are interesting man
12/3/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: What the heck
12/3/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: And yeah, we were grilling him about his stand up routine
12/3/19, 11:27 AM - Caleb: Apparently he does it in drag
12/3/19, 11:29 AM - Caleb: There have been some days where he came into class with painted nails and other days where he was like "ah I got a little too wild last night, so if I'm a little dull today I'm sorry"
12/3/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: Yeah
12/3/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: My advisors are cool
12/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: But wow this man sounds legendary
12/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I relate though
12/3/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I wish I could tell profs that
12/3/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: And wait wait what did John say about rooming?
12/3/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Oh I didn't finish this
12/3/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: We just thought it was part of his energy
12/3/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: But it turns out he'd have a sold out show the night before and things got wild during the after party
12/3/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: And he just posted something where he got the roommate he wanted
12/3/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: And I was like "yeet no roommate"
12/3/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/3/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: Oh well
12/3/19, 12:38 PM - Caleb: What happens happen
12/3/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: Also THERE ARE SNOW FLURRIES!
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah well that‚Äôs still a pretty sick prof
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: How old is he?
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Or like around I don‚Äôt expect you to know exactly
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: And oh I wonder if everyone got their assignments
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: And well I mean they are put 3 people in ‚Äúdouble‚Äù all the time
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm holding out some home
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: Hope**
12/3/19, 1:10 PM - Marianna: AND YAY
12/3/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: Also I got my viking essay back
12/3/19, 2:00 PM - Caleb: 92!
12/3/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: I really thought you were answering my question as to how old he was and I was so confused for a minute
12/3/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: But congrats!!!
12/3/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre welcome
12/3/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure the proper commas helped you
12/3/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: (No I‚Äôm kidding it was great before I touched it)
12/3/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Also I‚Äôm going and assigning locations to my photos and wow I missed when you were here for a week that was such a great week
12/3/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha
12/3/19, 2:37 PM - Caleb: I think he's like 35
12/3/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: Hang on
12/3/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: He was 28 in 2013
12/3/19, 2:38 PM - Caleb: So yeah about
12/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Also I just had a 60 year old 6'8" Danish man with a big fluffy beard lecture me about anime for an hour
12/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: Is this real life
12/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: And it was my last class for Nordic Mythology! It's all ending sorta unceremoniously
12/3/19, 2:44 PM - Caleb: But hey
12/3/19, 2:45 PM - Caleb: It beats hard goodbyes sometimes
12/3/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: Good
12/3/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: Good
12/3/19, 2:45 PM - Marianna: And good
12/3/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: Was the anime for Nordic mythology?
12/3/19, 2:46 PM - Marianna: How is that at all related?
12/3/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: It was our last class so it was all about modern Nordic religion
12/3/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: And part of it was pop culture worship
12/3/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: And apparently there's a TON of Japanese takes on the vikings
12/3/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: None of which are remotely accurate
12/3/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: Except for like one apparently
12/3/19, 2:51 PM - Caleb: It's basically just names that get used
12/3/19, 2:52 PM - Caleb: Also that reminds me that you had an anime phase
12/3/19, 3:06 PM - Marianna: I did not
12/3/19, 3:07 PM - Marianna: And this class sounded so cool
12/3/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: Uh
12/3/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: Hey I believe you did
12/3/19, 3:10 PM - Caleb: Ms. I-joined-anime-club
12/3/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: Nem nem nem nem
12/3/19, 3:10 PM - Marianna: I _went_ to an anime club which was just nerds at a library because my friends wanted to
12/3/19, 3:11 PM - Marianna: I have never read or watched or whatever you do with anime
12/3/19, 3:11 PM - Marianna: But I genuinely had no interest and didn‚Äôt actually love that my friends did like it seemed very cult like
12/3/19, 3:21 PM - Caleb: Nope
12/3/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: Sorry
12/3/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: I've already got you a Anime subscription for Christmas
12/3/19, 3:22 PM - Caleb: Too late you're committed
12/3/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: Ah I'm sorry I don't mean to embarass you
12/3/19, 3:23 PM - Caleb: To be fair, there was one show that my friends and I used to all watch
12/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: We lived so far from each other, so we figured out this one service called cytube which let's people watch YouTube videos together in sync
12/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: So we would all get in a Skype call and hang out and watch a movie together, and one time we watched an anime
12/3/19, 3:24 PM - Caleb: And my gosh, it was actually so much fun
12/3/19, 3:25 PM - Marianna: Yeah I seriously don‚Äôt like that I went it‚Äôs kind of embarrassing not that it should be but it‚Äôs not really a community I see myself in
12/3/19, 3:26 PM - Caleb: Oh yeah
12/3/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: Gotta love it when communities ruin something for everyone else
12/3/19, 3:27 PM - Caleb: This is why we can't have nice things
12/3/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: Also hey hey
12/3/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: On a less embarrassing topic
12/3/19, 3:29 PM - Caleb: Tonight do you want to see the Medium post for the project I did?
12/3/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: What is a medium post?
12/3/19, 3:57 PM - Marianna: But sure!
12/3/19, 3:58 PM - Marianna: (Also sorry I haven‚Äôt been sending my usual verbose messages I‚Äôm working on crypto and hating it but trying to contribute
12/3/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: No worries!
12/3/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: I'll just talk to you after you're done
12/3/19, 4:14 PM - Caleb: I've got my own work anyway
12/3/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm getting sooooo tired
12/3/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Uhhhhhhhhhhh
12/3/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: Me want sleep
12/3/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: And me have other homework
12/3/19, 4:36 PM - Marianna: I hate this project
12/3/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: Okay so I'm guessing that you don't have time to read my scifi thing tonight?
12/3/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: It's totally no worry if you don't
12/3/19, 4:42 PM - Caleb: The word limit was _approximately 1000 words_ and I'm sitting at 1890 right now, but I emailed him and he said it was all good
12/3/19, 4:43 PM - Caleb: And I absolutely understand you've got a lot going on tonight
12/3/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Alright heading hope
12/3/19, 5:07 PM - Marianna: Home
12/3/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll still try to give it a read!  I might not be able to edit but I can certainly just read your story!
12/3/19, 5:08 PM - Marianna: Hey how are you doing?
12/3/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: Good!
12/3/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: I'm running out of steam though
12/3/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: I've written about 7 pages in 24 hours, and it's fun but still taxing
12/3/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: And I forgot I rode my bike here, so that's how I'm getting home
12/3/19, 5:28 PM - Caleb: What about you?
12/3/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: Running out of steam too
12/3/19, 5:44 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôm gonna eat dinner and rally and do work
12/3/19, 5:45 PM - Marianna: Kind of excited but kind of scared now that I realize just how close the semester is to being over
12/3/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: I totally feel that
12/3/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: It's like woah
12/3/19, 6:02 PM - Caleb: I have only two more classes
12/3/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: Tonight I submit two finals
12/3/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: And then it's so so little
12/3/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: I mean hell I'm home in 11 days
12/3/19, 6:03 PM - Caleb: Also, on an unrelated note I've rediscovered something wonderful about project management
12/3/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: You actually need to do so little of the legwork as long as you come up with ideas, deligate work, and coordinate between people
12/3/19, 6:04 PM - Caleb: It's honestly so much fun
12/3/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: And before you think I haven't done any of this, I have done a sizable chunk
12/3/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: But it's so much fun to lead a project
12/3/19, 6:05 PM - Caleb: I forgot about this feeling
12/3/19, 6:31 PM - Marianna: üò±
12/3/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt remember that feeling but I think I miss it
12/3/19, 6:32 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôll be home so soon!
12/3/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs so nice!
12/3/19, 6:33 PM - Marianna: Yeah that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm kind of handling it rn
12/3/19, 6:35 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm usually comfy leading but I‚Äôm taking a backseat on this one
12/3/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: Well that's good
12/3/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: We all need a break
12/3/19, 6:51 PM - Caleb: And as long as it's going well, there's no need to struggle for leadership
12/3/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Yeah I think it‚Äôs fine
12/3/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Hans is actually doing great
12/3/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: He‚Äôs kind of carryi it
12/3/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: Carrying
12/3/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: He has stopped annoying me so much
12/3/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Although yesterday he asked me like a really upsetting question on the bus and I was like dude you don‚Äôt just ask people that and he kind of explained why he was curious because he had a friend going through some stuff and I was like yeah but you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve gone through so don‚Äôt assume people are willing to play this game and answer your questions
12/3/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: But he was better today
12/3/19, 7:03 PM - Caleb: Can I ask what the question was?
12/3/19, 7:04 PM - Caleb: And I'm glad to hear he's getting better! It still sucks to have to work with him in general, people like that are never fun to be around but at least it's not as taxing as it could be

12/3/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: ((And I have to conserve my energy))
12/3/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Good stuff
12/3/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Usually I just stay in during sisterhoods, either that or I'll hang with my guy friends

12/3/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Idk
12/3/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: It's just some tense feeling I had
12/3/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Can't pinpoint it
12/3/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: I guess I'm not totally sure what my social life is gonna look like next semester
12/3/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: It's what happens when your friengroup has a major issue rigjt before abroad
12/3/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: Also why am I dating someone 1000x more frat than me
12/3/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: What is this
12/3/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: Am I gonna be the lame one here
12/3/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: ü§î

12/3/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry about your friends again
12/3/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt really know exactly what happened and I‚Äôm here if you ever want to talk about it
12/3/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: But also I get if not
12/3/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: And because I‚Äôll bring dumb funness into your life!  I promise you will love drunk marianna she has like no filter and very little inhibition at doing fun spontaneous things like stargazing!
12/3/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: That was for sure her best decision last semester I‚Äôm proud of her
12/3/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Haha I'm proud of her too
12/3/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: And also jk there's no way I'm the lame one
12/3/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Maybe in comparison to my former self I'm lame
12/3/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: But also last semester was an off semester for me
12/3/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: I just realized my schedule sorta murdered my social life for the whole year
12/3/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: But when I did go out? Ho lord
12/3/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: I still think you haven't seen drunk Caleb yet
12/3/19, 8:02 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt wait to see this
12/3/19, 8:02 PM - Caleb: God help you
12/3/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: As long as he doesn‚Äôt puke on me I think I‚Äôll be fine
12/3/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: Yeah the most was maybe wine night here?
12/3/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/3/19, 8:03 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôve seen drunk marianna few times
12/3/19, 8:03 PM - Caleb: Well no to the throwing up on you thing
12/3/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: I can give you a pretty good guarantee of that not happening
12/3/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: And yeah
12/3/19, 8:04 PM - Caleb: But wine-drunk-cozy-Caleb is VERY different than hammering-shots-and-clubbing Caleb
12/3/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: And you DEFINITELY haven't seen that
12/3/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: There are many different drunk Calebs
12/3/19, 8:05 PM - Caleb: Most are gems
12/3/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: Also I made hot chocolate
12/3/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: But like proper hot chocolate
12/3/19, 8:06 PM - Caleb: And I'm so content
12/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: You see Marianna
12/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: This is the problem with being so damn cool
12/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: You pale in comparison to yourself
12/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: It's a tough life üòé
12/3/19, 8:07 PM - Caleb: _(kidding)_
12/3/19, 8:08 PM - Caleb: _(okay maybe not totally kidding but mostly)_
12/3/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: I want both calebs
12/3/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: Especially the wine and cozy one
12/3/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: I think I kind of have seen him a few times
12/3/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: And I like him a lot
12/3/19, 8:18 PM - Marianna: Man Saturday night was the best night I‚Äôve had in a while like just ah very nice and relaxing :)

12/4/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: I want to be there it looks so peaceful
12/4/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm currently sitting in front of a heater and I‚Äôm happy but I have to go back to class eventually
12/4/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Yeah Nick's sorta the same way
12/4/19, 12:42 PM - Caleb: Very much one of the girls
12/4/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: Hi
12/4/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre cool
12/4/19, 12:54 PM - Marianna: What have you been up to today
12/4/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: Update our mobile class has turned into a gigantic meme
12/4/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: Like people make memes in class and then share them in the AIT group chat
12/4/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs great
12/4/19, 4:01 PM - Marianna: They are all hilarious
12/4/19, 4:29 PM - Caleb: Hello!
12/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Sorry it's been a busy day
12/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: I just got out of presentations and the closing dinner for Neural Nets
12/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: That's awesome
12/4/19, 4:30 PM - Caleb: Those classes are the best but at a certain point you learn SO little sometimes
12/4/19, 4:31 PM - Caleb: How are you?
12/4/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay how were the presentations and dinner?
12/4/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: And yeah we‚Äôve kind of reached that point
12/4/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: I need to figure out the 3rd homework assignment for the class but don‚Äôt really get what I am supposed to do yet because the class has been so full of jokes recently
12/4/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good
12/4/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: Cold and I really don‚Äôt feel great but whatever
12/4/19, 4:49 PM - Marianna: Home now to do laundry, nap, rally, and do homework
12/4/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: Dinner was overpriced but not on my bill so heyo
12/4/19, 4:56 PM - Caleb: It was still good
12/4/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: And the presentations went well!
12/4/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: It was fun just hanging out and getting dinner with Ulf
12/4/19, 4:57 PM - Caleb: At the beginning of the semester a lot of people thought he didn't really have his suit together and wasn't putting a lot of effort into the class, but now I can see that it actually really mattered to him and he knew what he was doing
12/4/19, 4:58 PM - Caleb: And hey that sounds like an awesome plan
12/4/19, 4:59 PM - Marianna: You all are so lucky dis takes you out to eat so often
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: All we get is weird hungarian pizza
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: And like 2x this entire semester
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Including today
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: Because we did course evals and they bribed us with pizza
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: And said it was mandatory
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: Hey Hungarian pizza sounds fun
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Marianna: But it was during lunch so they kind of had to feed us
12/4/19, 5:00 PM - Caleb: In Denmark they like to put bananas on it
12/4/19, 5:02 PM - Caleb: And also
12/4/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: I feel like I should clarify something from earlier
12/4/19, 5:03 PM - Caleb: I know I joked about this being fake school the other day, but honestly it's still something I take seriously and have taken a lot away from
12/4/19, 5:04 PM - Caleb: I said it was fake because there was no busy work and the tests weren't incredibly hard, but it's still made me learn so much
12/4/19, 5:06 PM - Caleb: And not only that, but it's giving me real experience and freedom to make what I want of some awesome resources. I'm coming out of this with a new appreciation and curiosity about so many things, and it's crazy to see how far we've come during the semester with so little stress
12/4/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: So idk, I guess I just want you to know that it's not all traveling and dinners and partying
12/4/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: And I know some people come out of DIS with that as their experience, but I guess I just lucked out with my classes
12/4/19, 5:07 PM - Caleb: Sorry, that's a lot
12/4/19, 5:08 PM - Caleb: It's just been bothering me a little
12/4/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Nah it‚Äôs fine I never thought ‚Äúoh caleb has easy school‚Äù like there certainly are some programs like that but from what you‚Äôve told me all of your stuff seems legit and educaitonal
12/4/19, 5:15 PM - Marianna: Marion however has done literally no homework and skips class a lot
12/4/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Actually idk how much she‚Äôs skipped this semester in particular but she‚Äôs really good at not going to class
12/4/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Most of the time she and mitch literally just hooked up instead of going to class
12/4/19, 5:16 PM - Marianna: Yet she‚Äôs still doin pretty great grade wise somehow
12/4/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: But everything you have been able to do while there sounds so awesome
12/4/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: Also‚ÄîI was gonna post photos from this weekend on insta. Do you oppose to me posting a pic with you in it?  I know you‚Äôre particular about Instagram and may be trying to not be on it as much so if you don‚Äôt want me to I totally understand and will just post pictures of me and the artsy ones I took!
12/4/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/4/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: I have no idea how some people do it man
12/4/19, 5:23 PM - Caleb: This is why stem majors give people shit
12/4/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: I personally try not to, but gosh it's like come on, how do you get away with that
12/4/19, 5:24 PM - Caleb: And sure! I'm all good with that
12/4/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: As long as it's a good one üòâ
12/4/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: My main qualm with Instagram is that it's usually pure fiction about how perfect people's lives can be, and I was believing in it too much
12/4/19, 5:26 PM - Caleb: But I was there for that weekend, so I know it was _actually_ just about perfect :)
12/4/19, 5:37 PM - Marianna: I have been called out for ‚Äúmistreating‚Äù humanities majors
12/4/19, 5:37 PM - Marianna: So now I try not to talk about my English major friends being English majors because it always comes off rude apparently
12/4/19, 5:37 PM - Marianna: And it is!
12/4/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: ‚ÄúJust about perfect‚Äù?!?!
12/4/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: Okay well I guess that means we can only go up from here I‚Äôm okay with that
12/4/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: I did almost miss my flight
12/4/19, 5:38 PM - Marianna: I thought about making the caption about that but that‚Äôs not as funny it‚Äôs just scary
12/4/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: I was for sure thinking I‚Äôd be sleeping in the Charleroi airport
12/4/19, 5:39 PM - Marianna: I am very glad I slept in my own bed
12/4/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Yeah between me not being able to find my booking and you almost missing your flight, Sunday had some stress but honestly still 100% worth it
12/4/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: Also I'm guessing yes, but is it good if I post a pic with you in it then?
12/4/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: Also oh geez I always feel like I need a clever comment
12/4/19, 5:51 PM - Caleb: I'll throw you a like for now and get back to you when inspiration strikes me
12/4/19, 5:53 PM - Marianna: Oh gosh wow we BOTH almost didn‚Äôt make it home
12/4/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: And yeah as long as it‚Äôs not the one of us kissing or where I look like a phantom with teeth when I was jumping up and down
12/4/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: And that is a okay with me
12/4/19, 5:54 PM - Marianna: You don‚Äôt need to comment I won‚Äôt take offense haha
12/4/19, 5:56 PM - Marianna: Oh my gosh ben so warm. Goodnight for an hour or so
12/4/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: DARN IT
12/4/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: The blur picture is pure gold
12/4/19, 6:01 PM - Caleb: There goes that
12/4/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: Oh gosh
12/4/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: Posting in general feels weird now
12/4/19, 6:24 PM - Caleb: I don't know if I like it
12/4/19, 6:25 PM - Caleb: If I still feel like this in an hour or two, I'll probably delete my posts again
12/4/19, 6:46 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sorry
12/4/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm shocked that you at least recognize how upset it makes you
12/4/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: Or like recognize it‚Äôs bad for you
12/4/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: Not bad shocked like impressed shocked
12/4/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: Update I tried to sleep but alas
12/4/19, 6:47 PM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm just gonna lie in bed for another few minutes and then get up and do stuff
12/4/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: Ah that's rough
12/4/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
12/4/19, 6:48 PM - Caleb: And idk if it makes me upset
12/4/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: It's just uncomfortable
12/4/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: And hey know whars more fun than hearing me complain about social media
12/4/19, 6:49 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Whars more fun
12/4/19, 6:55 PM - Marianna: Are you saying Icelandic hot chocolate
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Marianna: How did you get Icelandic hot chocolate
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Yep
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Icelandic hot chocolate is more fun than hearing me complain
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: Obviously
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: And well the chocolate was in the shared food pile
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: And I had milk
12/4/19, 6:56 PM - Caleb: So I made it!
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Shared food like?
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Sarah and I just call that a fridge
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: Nope
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Man I love living with a best friend
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: We've got a specific spot for food that's up for grabs
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: I just sneezed and a car alarm went off
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: AWWWW
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Do I have special powers
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: I'm so happy to hear that
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Caleb: The best friend thing
12/4/19, 6:57 PM - Marianna: Oh that‚Äôs actually such a good idea
12/4/19, 6:58 PM - Caleb: Not that you sneeze so loud that you set off car alarms
12/4/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: Maybe I‚Äôll text molly to try to implement that next time she lives with someone
12/4/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: :)
12/4/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: At least it wasn‚Äôt a burp
12/4/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: But I think my sneezes are quite loud
12/4/19, 6:58 PM - Marianna: That literally shake my whole body
12/4/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: But people usually laugh and say I sneeze like a mouse or a cat
12/4/19, 6:59 PM - Marianna: Anytime during the summer when Id sneeze, the guy that called me Godiva would be like YO GUYS DID YOU HEAR A MOUSE DO WE HAVE A MOUSE IN THE SQUAD ROOM
12/4/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: I really don't think they are
12/4/19, 7:05 PM - Caleb: There are some people that have SUPER loud sneezes like Lee
12/4/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: And some that basically exhale quickly
12/4/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: And you're in the comfy middle
12/4/19, 7:06 PM - Caleb: Also this hot chocolate is so gosh darn good
12/4/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: It's Icelandic, so it's like the ones Odin used to drink with fallen warriors in the halls of Valhalla
12/4/19, 7:07 PM - Caleb: Except those had mini marshmallows
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Thanks I like being in the comfy middle
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good place to be no matter that the scale is
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: Yea if it's in the middle of some SHEETS
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Caleb: Haaaa
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: üôÑ
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: Ah yes me
12/4/19, 7:10 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs the saying
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Fool me once
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Beast in the sheets or something
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Shame on you
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: No?
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: But teach a man to fool me
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm just confused or soemthing
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: And I'll be fooled for the rest of my life
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: You fooled me!
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Woah there partner
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: I was talking about some comfy sheets
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: And I don‚Äôt believe that Od√≠n Gad marshmallow
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Had
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Oh
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Marianna: Can one not be a beast in comfy sheets?
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Well
12/4/19, 7:11 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Because that‚Äôs just unfortunate
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: But genuinely I was talking about your napping habits
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: For the record
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Haaaa
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: I thought you were just making fun of me
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: Yeah you got me
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: Whatever
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: It was whipped cream
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: üôÑ
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre getting so many eye rolls tonight
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Caleb: TWO EYE ROLLS!
12/4/19, 7:12 PM - Marianna: So many!!!!
12/4/19, 7:13 PM - Marianna: And the night isn‚Äôt even over yet!!!
12/4/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: Sounds like I'm on a roll
12/4/19, 7:13 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: No
12/4/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: Stop
12/4/19, 8:20 PM - Marianna: I beg of you
12/4/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: Fine fine
12/4/19, 8:26 PM - Caleb: But you know Magic School Bus was amazing
12/4/19, 8:27 PM - Marianna: I did love it
12/4/19, 8:31 PM - Caleb: Have you ever done an Advent of Code?
12/4/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: No what‚Äôs that?
12/4/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Also hi
12/4/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm in such a big I miss davidson mood tonight and sarah hates it like I‚Äôm talking too much about being excited to be back but ah!  I want!  My home!
12/4/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs also seen her parents though like I am missing everything that is comforting like I usually get a trip home or to Hilton Head and I haven‚Äôt had a relaxing weekend I guess
12/4/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: Sorry now I‚Äôm complaining
12/4/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Hey hey
12/4/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: You're okay
12/4/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: If you ever want to complain I'm here to listen
12/4/19, 9:04 PM - Marianna: Okay
12/4/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: I hate complaining but I also hate apologizing for complaining because I never care if people complain to me but I also know some people don‚Äôt like it because it makes them sad or angry or something so I may stop apologizing but you are always able to say you don‚Äôt want me to complain and I will understand
12/4/19, 9:05 PM - Marianna: And you don‚Äôt ever have to apologize about complaining
12/4/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs like how I see into my friends lives
12/4/19, 9:06 PM - Marianna: And learn DraMA
12/4/19, 9:21 PM - Caleb: Well thank you but I'll still keep it at a minimum
12/4/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: How are you doing?
12/4/19, 9:22 PM - Caleb: What are you up to tonight?
12/4/19, 9:23 PM - Caleb: Also how do you feel that there is no such thing as software, only internal states of hardware
12/4/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Working on mobile with robin
12/4/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Josh May come hang
12/4/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: And well
12/4/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt like it
12/4/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: But like you write software win hardware
12/4/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: On**
12/4/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: And the hardware saves it and lets you use it
12/4/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Idk
12/4/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: I think we can still differentiate
12/4/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Yeah totally
12/4/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: I just think it's a weird reminder
12/4/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Also I hate C++ so much
12/4/19, 10:33 PM - Caleb: Why am I not using Golang
12/4/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: Hi
12/4/19, 10:34 PM - Caleb: I miss you
12/4/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Why are you using c++
12/4/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I have never had to use c++
12/4/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: C yes but not c++
12/4/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I miss you too
12/4/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Hate it tbh
12/4/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: I don't have to use it, I just figured I'd brush up on a language I'm not as good at because python has made me super lazy
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: And here I am, fighting to declare a vector
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: C might be the right call here
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - Marianna: C is entertaining to fight with
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: I love python
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: And also dangerous
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: I didn‚Äôt realize how nice it was
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: You have to be the Steve Irwin of coding to enjoy it
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: Like after java and c it‚Äôs so great
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: You know what I should brush up on
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Pascal
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Bingo
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Marianna: I loved Steve Irwin
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Caleb: Maximum utility
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: Okay
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: Is that like python
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: No
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: I remember you mentioning it
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Marianna: Oh darn
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: Its like Fortran
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: You know so many more languages
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Marianna: But do you know power shell
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: That's a blatant lie
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: And also oh lord no
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: And I refuse to learn
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: Right now I'm on zshell and it's changed my life
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: I'm never crawling back to windows again
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah no would not recommend power she‚Äôll
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Shell **
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: You learned it in like a day, right?
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: But I did enjoy just playing with it for 8 hours on uncle sams dime
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Two 4 hours shifts but yeah
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Marianna: Like I went to work Tuesday and Thursday
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - Caleb: That's gotta be fun if you don't have anything else you have hanging over your head
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: It was after the shutdown so I had to do a lot of hours to make sure I got my monthly stuff in
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Well I mean I had school
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Was that your only work thing at the moment though?
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: I was working like 10-2 Tuesday and Thursday
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Oh lord
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: They didn‚Äôt have a ton for me to do independently
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: That's the drama
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Dream
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Marianna: No I would reject that
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: I would reject your rejection
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I worked thursday 8-12 which meant leaving campus before 7 in the fall
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Which was admittedly worse
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Oh not the hours thing
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: That sounds awful
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Oh the lack of work
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: No
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I would rather have been doing filing than have nothing
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: The dream is just getting paid to do one thing leisurely and have fun with it
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: But often they didn‚Äôt have anything that was interesting
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Ah yeah that sucks
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: This was the only project I got to code for
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: I was fortunate enough to have total creative license
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: wHAT
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: No I guess I got to do some sql
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Do they know who you are?!?!
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Because they don‚Äôt just let you write scripts on government computers apparently
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: ... You know that makes sense
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: Also I wasn‚Äôt a computer scientist
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Bless private industry bb üòéüòé
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: But that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say about that for now
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: And yeah
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I want to try the private industry!!!
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: I mean technically I wasn't private industry
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: Oh!  Did I tell you vanguard is gonna fly me to philly in January?
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: Research is it's own shtick I guess
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Caleb: And yeah! The 14th, right?
12/4/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: Also hey how's your work coming
12/4/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: 15th is interview but I‚Äôd have to spend the 14th up there

12/4/19, 11:15 PM - Caleb: I hope it goes well
12/4/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: I was wondering if maybe you wanted to call for like 15 minutes, but my eyes are sagging petty hard right now so I think I'd be the one to pass out
12/4/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: You got all your stuff turned in?
12/4/19, 11:25 PM - Marianna: Do you have finals or just projects?  What‚Äôs the timeline for all of them?
12/4/19, 11:26 PM - Marianna: And well I‚Äôm hanging with people so I don‚Äôt think I can I‚Äôm sorry :(

12/4/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Whyyyyyy
12/4/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôd you do last night that stopped sleep?  Or did you just wake up super early
12/4/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Update audrey says our photos from the weekend are adorable

12/5/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: Also ahaha that's awesome
12/5/19, 9:53 AM - Caleb: Yours didn't make it into mine, but you can REALLY see my music change when I started hanging out with you because of the things you sent and probably my mood
12/5/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/5/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: Also I've woken up to pupdates
12/5/19, 9:54 AM - Caleb: Wanna see them?
12/5/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: Really?  Cool
12/5/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôll take that as a compliment
12/5/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: And yes yes yes
12/5/19, 9:57 AM - Marianna: Is that even a question
12/5/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: The music changing when I started hanging out with you is just kind of a fact, and also that you were sending me a lot of stuff to listen to
12/5/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: The Boy thing definitely is a compliment though
12/5/19, 9:59 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/5/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: And ask and ye shall receive
12/5/19, 10:00 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/5/19, 10:01 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>

12/5/19, 10:05 AM - Caleb: Fun fact

12/5/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Well Charlie's
12/5/19, 10:06 AM - Caleb: Parker is a bunch of things but still 100% ours
12/5/19, 10:07 AM - Caleb: Also: Charlie gives GREAT hugs
12/5/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Parker is still a pretty boy even if he‚Äôs a lot of things
12/5/19, 11:00 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm bundled in a blanket
12/5/19, 11:01 AM - Marianna: And have to sit through working on crypto üôÑ
12/5/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: Ahhhh that's a rough morning
12/5/19, 11:36 AM - Caleb: I'm sorry
12/5/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: Holy shit
12/5/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: 9 days and I fly home

12/5/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm not one to give up but I just don‚Äôt want to do this
12/5/19, 12:07 PM - Caleb: What's the project?
12/5/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: File transfer protocol design
12/5/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: Blah
12/5/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: Blah
12/5/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: Blah
12/5/19, 12:22 PM - Marianna: Just use Dropbox
12/5/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: That sounds awful
12/5/19, 12:23 PM - Caleb: But also super impressive
12/5/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: But we haven‚Äôt actually run ours
12/5/19, 12:32 PM - Marianna: And we‚Äôve spent like 7 hours in it
12/5/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Ahhhh
12/5/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: That's frustrating
12/5/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just like none of us have done anything like this and it seems so advanced and we don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre making it more complicated than it needs to be
12/5/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: But what‚Äôs
12/5/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: Whatever **
12/5/19, 1:13 PM - Marianna: How‚Äôs your day been?
12/5/19, 1:14 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm on my way home now
12/5/19, 1:17 PM - Caleb: Are you writing a homerolled version of actual FTP? Or is it another type like UDP or TCP
12/5/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Ha
12/5/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: You think I kn
12/5/19, 1:19 PM - Marianna: Know
12/5/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôre using open source network communication code but we have to customize it so it‚Äôs a secure transfer of messages and then the server character has to parse code and create files or things
12/5/19, 1:20 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs my best understanding of what we are doing
12/5/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: Oh lord that sounds hellish
12/5/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: I'm sorry
12/5/19, 1:19 PM - Caleb: My days been alright though
12/5/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: I'm doing my final project for medical ethics and part of it is coming up with cases and how different ethical approaches would treat them
12/5/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: And currently we're sitting at about 3500 words
12/5/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: And there's no end in sight
12/5/19, 1:20 PM - Caleb: Also I got my history of Copenhagen assignment back and it was a 95
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Hey good job!!!
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Again
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre welcome
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: **bows with a flourish**
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: And wow that‚Äôs a lot of words. How many pages is that
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Marianna: Oh I have to read your dystopian paper
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: Wait a second what am I welcome for
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: And currently it's 7 pages with 1.15 spacing and 12 point font
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: And it's with only one other person
12/5/19, 1:33 PM - Caleb: I'm just happy they're also putting in the work
12/5/19, 1:34 PM - Caleb: And aaaahhhh noooo that's alright it really honestly wasn't great
12/5/19, 2:18 PM - Marianna: Didn‚Äôt I help proofread it
12/5/19, 2:19 PM - Marianna: Oh gosh I have never written a paper with other people
12/5/19, 2:19 PM - Marianna: Hey I‚Äôve read a lot in my time
12/5/19, 2:20 PM - Marianna: And I seriously doubt it can be worse than some things I‚Äôve read
12/5/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Nope
12/5/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: This one was just me
12/5/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: You were pretty busy so I figured you didn't have time
12/5/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Also oh gosh
12/5/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Out of curiosity what's the worst
12/5/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: Oh
12/5/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: Well than good job
12/5/19, 2:24 PM - Marianna: Then
12/5/19, 2:25 PM - Marianna: Hmm
12/5/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm honestly not sure
12/5/19, 2:26 PM - Marianna: I forget what it‚Äôs called but i know what the cover looks like
12/5/19, 2:27 PM - Marianna: But when books aren‚Äôt good I tend to not remember them
12/5/19, 2:28 PM - Marianna: And it‚Äôs been a few years
12/5/19, 2:28 PM - Caleb: Well that's a shame
12/5/19, 2:29 PM - Caleb: I'm always up for a book that's so horrendously bad that it comes full circle and is good again
12/5/19, 2:29 PM - Caleb: Kinda like troll 2
12/5/19, 2:29 PM - Caleb: Also, I'm debating something
12/5/19, 2:29 PM - Caleb: Even if I manage to keep the spin/yoga class
12/5/19, 2:29 PM - Caleb: I'm thinking about dropping it and doing Jiu Jitsu
12/5/19, 2:29 PM - Caleb: I've watched a bunch of clips and it looks super fun
12/5/19, 2:30 PM - Caleb: And it makes me miss my tournament days
12/5/19, 2:32 PM - Marianna: But these books aren‚Äôt even like that they just stay bad
12/5/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: Well I‚Äôm gonna keep the spin yoga
12/5/19, 2:33 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve never done jiu jitsu but sounds cool!
12/5/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Although as someone who‚Äôs did tai chi at davidson those martial arts classes are not like dogo classes
12/5/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: Well yeah
12/5/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: I'd do it at a studio in Cornelius
12/5/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: I miss the competitive aspect of fitness a lot
12/5/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: There's nooooo way Davidson would offer Jiu Jitsu
12/5/19, 2:36 PM - Caleb: It's all about actual contact and that's the exact opposite of what Davidson wants
12/5/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: Ooooh gotcha
12/5/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: Yeah I debated doing yoga off campus but I‚Äôm opposed to paying when I can do yoga on campus and also having to commute more than a walk to baker
12/5/19, 2:43 PM - Marianna: But hey if there is something off campus that you would rather do I say go for it
12/5/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm about to nap and I can‚Äôt wait until we‚Äôre together again and we can nap together
12/5/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Unless you want to pop on over for a quick nap rn
12/5/19, 2:44 PM - Marianna: Also I really think it is colder here in Budapest than Copenhagen now
12/5/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: Ahhhhh
12/5/19, 2:53 PM - Caleb: I would but I have class in an hour
12/5/19, 2:54 PM - Caleb: Sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/5/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: It'll be awesome in a month though
12/5/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: SO many naps
12/5/19, 2:57 PM - Caleb: Also yeah I honestly think I'd want to get off campus a little
12/5/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: The main deal for me was not having a car, but once I got one I was always hiking or doing something
12/5/19, 2:58 PM - Caleb: It's just so much ~freedom ~
12/5/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Why is freedom crossed out
12/5/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: And yeah I‚Äôm or as much of a person to get off campus
12/5/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: Actually I did more my sophomore year
12/5/19, 5:02 PM - Marianna: I like going to target and I do like driving just not 77 driving
12/5/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: I think this was longer of a nap than I had planned
12/5/19, 5:03 PM - Marianna: Oh well
12/5/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Yeah wasn't that like 2 hours
12/5/19, 5:16 PM - Caleb: Kinda impressive tbh
12/5/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Also it isn't crossed out on my screen
12/5/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: I wanted to do a "~~~~~~" thing
12/5/19, 5:17 PM - Caleb: Put some emphasis on it
12/5/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah i like that think I miss being able to do it
12/5/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: Because if I do on WhatsApp it crosses it out
12/5/19, 5:17 PM - Marianna: :(
12/5/19, 5:18 PM - Marianna: And yeah I need to get out of bed
12/5/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm out!
12/5/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: AND I got my laundry out of the machine
12/5/19, 5:35 PM - Marianna: It is kind of nice having it in my apartment so I don‚Äôt have to worry if it sits there for an hour
12/5/19, 5:36 PM - Marianna: Not too long so it gets musty but still
12/5/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: Ahaha yeah
12/5/19, 5:48 PM - Caleb: If you let mine sit for like 10 minutes after your reservation is over, it'll be in a basket
12/5/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: Also it just dawned on me
12/5/19, 5:49 PM - Caleb: I'll be the only one of my friends not living with my other friends this semester
12/5/19, 5:50 PM - Caleb: Kinda spooky
12/5/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: Oof that‚Äôs rough
12/5/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I have some snaps of how awesome belk laundry room got
12/5/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: And well you didn‚Äôt last year
12/5/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: But I feel bad you won‚Äôt have a roommate
12/5/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: Like I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd do well without a roommate
12/5/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: But again
12/5/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a crazy extrovert thing
12/5/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: And part of me is gonna feel bad if I‚Äôm not always in sarah and my room but also I think she genuinely might prefer that
12/5/19, 7:18 PM - Marianna: But whatever
12/5/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Yeah that's fair
12/5/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: I have an open invitation to their pod
12/5/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: So maybe I'll try to get a key or just some sort of guest access
12/5/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: Idk how Tommy access works
12/5/19, 7:22 PM - Caleb: And yeaaaaah
12/5/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: I like being around people
12/5/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: But not having to work around their schedule
12/5/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Or have them come in super late
12/5/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: Or not keep their side clean
12/5/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: But hey, I'm sure you'll have no complaints next year :)
12/5/19, 7:26 PM - Marianna: I mean it‚Äôs davidson no one locks their pods
12/5/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Yeah I liked when audrey had a boyfriend
12/5/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: Like I still had a roommate but she wasn‚Äôt there all the time and rarely at night
12/5/19, 7:30 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt mind about the mess on someone else‚Äôs side
12/5/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm more understanding about it I think because I know sometimes I get messy
12/5/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Well SOMEONE didn't room with Matt singleton
12/5/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: I'm messy too but good lord there's not mold growing from my stuff
12/5/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: I think you need a bad roommate experience
12/5/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: It's a mandatory college experience
12/5/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: You should see marions room
12/5/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: Mold everywhere
12/5/19, 7:42 PM - Marianna: She has so many old pizzas and baked potatoes on her desk
12/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: And well I had molly!
12/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Ah
12/5/19, 7:44 PM - Marianna: Molly still upsets me
12/5/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/5/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: But Molly was just an obnoxious person
12/5/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: She wasn't absolutely detrimental to your life
12/5/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: But imagine being Marion's roommate
12/5/19, 7:49 PM - Caleb: Except add that she also intentionally locked you out a few times, and any time you had friends over she acts like an asshole to them
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: He intentionally locked you out??
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs aw fil
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Awful
12/5/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: And yeah
12/5/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Yuperoni
12/5/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: I probably wouldn‚Äôt want to be
12/5/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: Marions roommate
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: He wasn't just bad to live with
12/5/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: I mean she‚Äôs sleeping with me for the next 4 days but whatever
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: He was actively an asshole
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: FOUR DAYS
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: What
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: That's awesome
12/5/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: And I'm a little jealous üòâ
12/5/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: Was it like when he brought someone back to the room?  Or just like randomly without telling you?
12/5/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: RANDOMLY!
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: He was jacking off
12/5/19, 7:54 PM - Caleb: ....
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: That has to be the explanation
12/5/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: I can in fact confirm that's not what he did
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Oh
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Well
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Darn
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Okay
12/5/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: And I dont know if I want to tell you how I know that
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: Idk what other reason there would be
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Marianna: And I think I want to know
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: Unless I don‚Äôt
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs your call
12/5/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: How often do you use the bathroom in Rich
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Marianna: First not often
12/5/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: And well not often anymore at all
12/5/19, 7:58 PM - Marianna: I have a funny story about this to follow up
12/5/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Well
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: He told me he just went to a bathroom stall
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: So don't use the one closest to the wall in first rich
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: And also
12/5/19, 7:57 PM - Caleb: He told me at the end of the year that a few times were out of spite
12/5/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: But now that I think about it, he probably just said that because it was less embarrassing than saying he was jacking off
12/5/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: Why would you tell your roommate that
12/5/19, 7:58 PM - Caleb: Which part
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: Like I feel like it‚Äôs weird to be like yo this is where I jack off
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: I have a liam story
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: He went into the bathroom in sentelle to and only after did he realize HE WAS ON THE WRONG FLOOR
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: HE HAD GONE UP TO 4th
12/5/19, 7:59 PM - Caleb: We got drunk in the beginning of sophomore year and he said it like "ahhh Cale remeber the good times"
12/5/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: SO WE HAS IN THE WRONG BATHROOM
12/5/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: he felt very bad about it
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: And then all the times that I went to the bathroom and saw his flip-flops and pants around his ankles just flashed into my head
12/5/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Did he call you cake?
12/5/19, 8:01 PM - Marianna: Cale**
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Cale
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Yep
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Which is why I have a veto on it
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Also I feel like Liam's story isn't terrible
12/5/19, 8:00 PM - Caleb: Unless someone is showering I totally don't see an issue
12/5/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Although having urinals in a bathroom without women is super nice
12/5/19, 8:01 PM - Caleb: Gotta say
12/5/19, 8:22 PM - Marianna: Oh now I don‚Äôt like him for that I like cale but I won‚Äôt I promise
12/5/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: I once had a guy called me mari like mahri which isn‚Äôt even the start of marianna like how I say it and I was like you know that‚Äôs not right right and he was like well I still get to call you whatever I want
12/5/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: So I get it
12/5/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: But the davidson bathrooms are gender neutral because of the swapping so there‚Äôs not much to help you with that
12/5/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/5/19, 8:24 PM - Marianna: At a coffee shop with sarah now until marion gets here!
12/5/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/5/19, 8:27 PM - Caleb: Matt ruined Cale and Pat ruined 'Leb
12/5/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: So if you can get creative with the remaining letter let me know
12/5/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: Ale? %
12/5/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: AND WOAH
12/5/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: SO EXCITING
12/5/19, 8:28 PM - Caleb: Say hi to Sarah for me
12/5/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Well I don‚Äôt like Leb so that‚Äôs fine
12/5/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: But yeah not a lot to work with
12/5/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: Darn you for having a short name
12/5/19, 8:33 PM - Marianna: I will
12/5/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: But she‚Äôs hard grinding rn
12/5/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: And I should too
12/5/19, 8:34 PM - Marianna: Talk to ya in a bit
12/5/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: Ooo
12/5/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: I think I actually have a good one that I like
12/5/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: You've gotta come up with it though
12/5/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: And okay! Good luck, keep me updated
12/5/19, 9:57 PM - Marianna: WHAT
12/5/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: and you won‚Äôt tell meeeeee
12/5/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: Whyyyyyy
12/5/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: ü•∫
12/5/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: You got lucky sar already had a nickname for me
12/5/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: And you‚Äôve heard of my high school nick name yeah?
12/5/19, 9:58 PM - Marianna: And well
12/5/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Do you off the top of your head know the percentage of dna mutations that are deletions vs insertions vs transitions/transversions?
12/5/19, 9:59 PM - Marianna: Because the internet has been no help and I need that
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: Because it's gotta be your nickname
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: I just thought of one that I like, but I don't think anyone's called me it before
12/5/19, 10:09 PM - Caleb: But again
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Its gotta be yours
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: And no I don't think I have!
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: It varies per species
12/5/19, 10:10 PM - Caleb: Are we talking about in humans?
12/5/19, 10:12 PM - Marianna: Ahah!
12/5/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: Well that would make sense
12/5/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: I was finding a lot of formulas and research on how to calculate it
12/5/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: But don‚Äôt have data to do that
12/5/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: And well it depends
12/5/19, 10:13 PM - Marianna: For now I‚Äôm looking at verebrates
12/5/19, 10:14 PM - Marianna: Not entirely sure what I am looking at but whatever
12/5/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Yeah I don't think there's much out there on that
12/5/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Vertebrages is also a huge umbrella
12/5/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Vertebrates*
12/5/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Have you ever heard of Peto's Paradox?
12/5/19, 10:15 PM - Caleb: Also called the Whale Paradox I think
12/5/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Yeah it‚Äôs supposed to be a huge umbrella
12/5/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm trying to align dna from all vertebrates to see the evolution tree
12/5/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Or something
12/5/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: And no I have not
12/5/19, 10:17 PM - Marianna: Do educate me please
12/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Woah
12/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: That's absolutely wild
12/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Okay so basically
12/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: You know how cancer starts, right?
12/5/19, 10:27 PM - Caleb: Mutations
12/5/19, 10:28 PM - Caleb: Well if you have more cells, it means that there's a higher chance one of them mutates and you get cancer
12/5/19, 10:29 PM - Caleb: So why do humans get cancer SO MUCH more frequently than whales?
12/5/19, 10:30 PM - Caleb: Or mice
12/5/19, 10:31 PM - Caleb: "A man has 1000 times as many cells as a mouse and we usually live at least 30 times as long as mice. Exposure of two similar organisms to risk of carcinoma, one for 30 times as long as the other, would give 30^4 or 30^6 times the risk of carcinoma induction per epithelial cell. However, it seems that, in the wild, the probabilities of carcinoma induction in mice and in men are not vastly different. Are our stem cells really, then, a billion or a trillion times more "cancerproof" than murine stem cells? This is biologically pretty implausible; if human DNA is no more resistant to mutagenesis in vitro than mouse DNA, why don't we all die of multiple carcinomas at an early age?"
12/5/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: Woah
12/5/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs cool
12/5/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: I think I understand
12/5/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: I feel like I‚Äôve never really thought of animals getting cancer
12/5/19, 10:37 PM - Marianna: Like I know dogs do but I‚Äôve never thought about whales getting cancer
12/5/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/5/19, 10:40 PM - Caleb: It's wild
12/5/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: You might already know this because of bio or compbio, but basically DNA has methods of "spellchecking" itself
12/5/19, 10:41 PM - Caleb: And one of the reasons cancer happens is because there's a mutation in the very spell checker
12/5/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: And there's TONS of theories about these spell checkers and all sorts of other reasons
12/5/19, 10:42 PM - Caleb: Genetics are wild
12/5/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Mmb Or mbb or soemthing
12/5/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Or maybe thats something else but it did know that he‚Äôs
12/5/19, 10:44 PM - Marianna: Yes
12/5/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: My phone is not typing well
12/5/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Genetics are wild
12/5/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to worry about them
12/5/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll take my 1s and 0s anyway
12/5/19, 10:45 PM - Marianna: Any day**
12/5/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: At least when they do things I didn‚Äôt expect them to do, it‚Äôs because I made a bug somewhere they don‚Äôt just decide to flip bits randomly
12/5/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: Well thats the fun part
12/5/19, 10:49 PM - Caleb: I get 1s, 0s, and the whole "ACGT" thing
12/5/19, 10:50 PM - Caleb: And its crazy because you can go down the rabbit hole and weird things start happening
12/5/19, 10:51 PM - Caleb: Like T's and A's chemically have a weaker bond, so it's super easy for the DNA telomerase to open the DNA and start reading at things called Tata boxes
12/5/19, 10:52 PM - Caleb: Or how C's can lose an amine group and spontaneously turn into a U
12/5/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: Sorry that's all probably kinda boring
12/5/19, 10:57 PM - Caleb: I just think it's fun that there's so many levels of complexity and it just sorta happened naturally
12/5/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Anyway
12/5/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: How's your night?
12/5/19, 11:01 PM - Marianna: Well aren‚Äôt you a lucky ducky
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: And woah that‚Äôs cool who allowed dna to do that
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: MARIANNA
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: And well
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: EMERGENCY
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm stressed
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Marianna: Yeah?
12/5/19, 11:03 PM - Caleb: MY DAD JUST SENT ME A VIDEO MESSAGE OF MY GRANDMA
12/5/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: IT'S ADORABLE
12/5/19, 11:04 PM - Caleb: And aw I'm sorry why are you stressed
12/5/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Just thinking about all I have to do
12/5/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: And not wanting to fail any classes this semester
12/5/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: And while I love that marion is coming it‚Äôs really not a great weekend
12/5/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: But she gets that so she‚Äôll have some adventure on her own time
12/5/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: And oh my I‚Äôm tired
12/5/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: But I gotta stay up until she gets here
12/5/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: What time does she come in?
12/5/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Are yall still in the coffee shop?
12/5/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Also hey
12/5/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: You're spectacular
12/5/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Don't forget it
12/5/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: You got this
12/5/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Lands at 11:50 so 12:30 or so she‚Äôll be here hopefully
12/5/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: And then we‚Äôre gonna drink wine and then sleep
12/5/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: And hey
12/5/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Thanks
12/5/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: And no I‚Äôm in bed
12/5/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Which I‚Äôm not good for the I need to stay up thing
12/5/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/5/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: That sounds counterproductive
12/5/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Would you want to call for a bit then?
12/5/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: I totally get if you're just trying to work
12/5/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Yeah sure!
12/5/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to do work
12/5/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: I did some today
12/5/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll make myself do some tomorrow
12/5/19, 11:39 PM - Marianna: Before getting ‚Äúlitty titty‚Äù as marion requested
12/6/19, 12:45 AM - Caleb: Goodnight! Have fun with wine and Marion
12/6/19, 12:46 AM - Caleb: Thanks for hanging with me even if I was getting loopy-tired
12/6/19, 12:47 AM - Caleb: I miss you, and see you soon :)
12/6/19, 1:50 AM - Marianna: Hey miss ya too
12/6/19, 2:11 AM - Marianna: I have no idea how I‚Äôm still up
12/6/19, 2:24 AM - Marianna: Okay in bed
12/6/19, 2:25 AM - Marianna: Only have to be up in 7 hours
12/6/19, 2:25 AM - Marianna: No problem
12/6/19, 7:36 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm awake now
12/6/19, 8:36 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 9:48 AM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 9:48 AM - Caleb: Brahaim found the wine

12/6/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: Haha no worries, I'm sure it won't get in the way of future reservations
12/6/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: Maybe
12/6/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/6/19, 9:52 AM - Marianna: Ah I feel bad
12/6/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: It's my Davidson email so worst case scenario is I turn it into a burner
12/6/19, 9:52 AM - Caleb: It's really no problem
12/6/19, 9:53 AM - Caleb: Anyway
12/6/19, 9:53 AM - Caleb: How are ya
12/6/19, 10:01 AM - Marianna: Oh okay that‚Äôs at least good
12/6/19, 10:02 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm exhausted
12/6/19, 10:02 AM - Marianna: And like I need to work this weekend but I don‚Äôt want marions time here to be a bummer
12/6/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Ahhhhh
12/6/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: That's stressf
12/6/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: Stressful*
12/6/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: I'm sorry
12/6/19, 10:28 AM - Caleb: I'm sure she'll have an awesome weekend anyway
12/6/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: Idk I just don‚Äôt feel like being adventurous and taking her to see stuff
12/6/19, 10:50 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs also actually frozen here

12/6/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good stuff
12/6/19, 10:57 AM - Marianna: Greg‚Äôs the best
12/6/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: Wait
12/6/19, 11:39 AM - Caleb: I think I have a picture of the last time I sat on Santa's lap
12/6/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 12:22 PM - Caleb: Wonderful times
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: ADORable
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: Yes I do believe I‚Äôve seen this
12/6/19, 12:46 PM - Marianna: On a certain app
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs shall not be named
12/6/19, 12:47 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Ah yes
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: The Zombie game groupchat
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: Of course
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: And OOOOOO good luck and have fun
12/6/19, 1:08 PM - Caleb: I'm fully expecting some top shelf drunk texts now
12/6/19, 1:09 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Ah yes
12/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Good times
12/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm pumped
12/6/19, 1:23 PM - Marianna: Kind of bummed most of my friends are gone
12/6/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna look so LANE
12/6/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: LAME
12/6/19, 1:24 PM - Marianna: Marions gotta know I‚Äôm cool

12/6/19, 1:31 PM - Marianna: A pigeon can do what you do
12/6/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: I
12/6/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: Uh
12/6/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: I swear I can explain
12/6/19, 1:38 PM - Caleb: I'm actually a pigeon
12/6/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: I don't think I've ever received a text that bruised my ego this much
12/6/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: Damn
12/6/19, 1:39 PM - Caleb: At least their just saying "yes" or "no"
12/6/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: The second that they distinguish between Ductal Carcinoma in Situ and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, I'm donezo
12/6/19, 1:40 PM - Caleb: I'm also sending this to my dad
12/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: No dont hurt ego
12/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: I like Caleb ego
12/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: But I guess you tell me not to hype up your ego
12/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: So this is just balancing it out
12/6/19, 1:51 PM - Marianna: Hey how are you
12/6/19, 1:53 PM - Caleb: Hahaha I was kidding I still have a massive ego
12/6/19, 1:53 PM - Caleb: No worries üòò
12/6/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: But when pigeons start figuring out the hormone receptor chemistry from the raw appearance of a slide let me know :)
12/6/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: I'm pretty peachy
12/6/19, 1:54 PM - Caleb: I've just got a bunch of work to do
12/6/19, 1:55 PM - Caleb: And I'm going to a board game bar tonight with some people
12/6/19, 1:55 PM - Caleb: Including Cassie and Reid and CASSIES EX BOYFRIEND HOLY SHIT I DIDN'T REFISRER THIS
12/6/19, 1:55 PM - Caleb: GET READY FOR SEXUAL TENSION: BOARDGAME EDITION
12/6/19, 1:56 PM - Caleb: Reid and Cassie and Dane all in the same room? I need to bring some popcorn
12/6/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: Good
12/6/19, 1:57 PM - Marianna: Wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way
12/6/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: Idk
12/6/19, 2:04 PM - Caleb: I think I'm a mixed bag on my ego
12/6/19, 2:06 PM - Caleb: Unless you're talking about the sexual-tension board game night
12/6/19, 2:06 PM - Marianna: I will monitor the pigeon situation
12/6/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: And well I mean that‚Äôs probably how all those people felt in Daniels room that last night...
12/6/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm not sure that is gonna start sexual tension
12/6/19, 2:07 PM - Marianna: More like awkwardness
12/6/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/6/19, 2:20 PM - Caleb: Awkward indeed
12/6/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: It's either gonna be really uncomfortable, or it's gonna be an episode of jersey shore
12/6/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: And oh my gosh
12/6/19, 2:21 PM - Caleb: That night is still mind boggling
12/6/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: I hope episode of jersey shore
12/6/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: But I genuinely feel bad for Dane
12/6/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: Like he‚Äôs gonna have to see that
12/6/19, 2:55 PM - Marianna: It hasn‚Äôt been a long time
12/6/19, 2:56 PM - Marianna: Update I‚Äôve had more class today than sleep last night
12/6/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/6/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: But Dane is electing to come here
12/6/19, 3:08 PM - Caleb: So idk what's going on there
12/6/19, 3:09 PM - Caleb: I feel kinda bad for Reid honestly
12/6/19, 3:09 PM - Caleb: And oh no
12/6/19, 3:09 PM - Caleb: There's an awful realization
12/6/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: Is he a dsi student?
12/6/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: dis **
12/6/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: Or is he a...sane
12/6/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: Dane **
12/6/19, 3:13 PM - Marianna: And why just the rebound thing?
12/6/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: First off, excellent pun
12/6/19, 3:14 PM - Marianna: And yeah I think it‚Äôs happened more than not this semester
12/6/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: Second off, I think he graduated last year and has just been putting around Europe
12/6/19, 3:14 PM - Marianna: Because I have class 6hrs a day for 3 days so yeah
12/6/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: Goodness
12/6/19, 3:14 PM - Caleb: I still don't know how we survived high-school man
12/6/19, 3:15 PM - Marianna: Me neither
12/6/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: That happened way too often at Davidson last semester
12/6/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: Well
12/6/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: Not just class, but if you include labs and responsibilities
12/6/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: It's alright though
12/6/19, 3:18 PM - Caleb: We made it
12/6/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: Look at us
12/6/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: Yay
12/6/19, 3:19 PM - Caleb: Also I'm in the middle of doing laundry probably for the last time, and it's making me feel melancholy
12/6/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: Hey look ma I made it
12/6/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: And awww
12/6/19, 4:37 PM - Marianna: I realized I may only do laundry once more
12/6/19, 4:38 PM - Caleb: Have I told you how I kinda do countdowns in laundry days?
12/6/19, 4:43 PM - Marianna: No!  What?
12/6/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: Okay so it's kind of weird, but :
12/6/19, 4:44 PM - Caleb: Basically I count down to events in how many times I'll do laundry until that thing happens
12/6/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: Like when I came back from Greece, I realized I'm going to do laundry three times until I'm home
12/6/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: Or like when I was going Brussels, I was like "okay I need to do laundry twice until then"
12/6/19, 4:45 PM - Caleb: It's something that's just routine and super tangible that I have to do, and it feels way more real than saying weeks or months or something
12/6/19, 4:46 PM - Caleb: Idk, it's just something that makes sense to me
12/6/19, 4:47 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs interesting
12/6/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt think I do laundry that regularly
12/6/19, 4:48 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs kind of whenever I realize I‚Äôm out of something or I have 1 left of something
12/6/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: I guess I don't either
12/6/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: Usually it's when I'm out of something, or if I'm going somewhere and need to pack clean clothes
12/6/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: So it's kind of just a proxy for whatever is between me and that event
12/6/19, 4:49 PM - Caleb: And usually I can give it an estimate
12/6/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Update
12/6/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: I'm wiped
12/6/19, 5:14 PM - Caleb: Nap time

12/6/19, 9:51 PM - Marianna: Oooooh I still want to go to a board game bar
12/6/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: People I worked with this summer did that often
12/6/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: But of course I couldn‚Äôt go with them
12/6/19, 9:52 PM - Marianna: And Woah be careful

12/6/19, 10:46 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs weird but nice man
12/6/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Oh?
12/6/19, 10:58 PM - Caleb: Yeah I can see that
12/6/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: It's just so seasonal
12/6/19, 10:59 PM - Caleb: Kinda like apple cider
12/6/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: How insensitive Caleb
12/6/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: I Can‚Äôt DRINK apple cider
12/6/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: Actually I probably could it‚Äôs pretty cooked
12/6/19, 11:12 PM - Marianna: But whatever
12/6/19, 11:14 PM - Caleb: You need to take risks Mar
12/6/19, 11:16 PM - Caleb: Except ones that will kill you
12/6/19, 11:45 PM - Marianna: No Caleb do you know me at all
12/6/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: I am like the last person to take a risk
12/6/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs great

12/7/19, 1:08 AM - Marianna: Let me be not spontaneous
12/7/19, 1:09 AM - Marianna: Actually well I can be spontaneous
12/7/19, 1:10 AM - Marianna: But my level of spontaneity that I want is HEY LETS GO STARGAZING OR SKINNING DIPPING AT LAKE CAMPUS OR BOTH and not let‚Äôs get blackout and drive golf carts drunk around campus
12/7/19, 1:10 AM - Marianna: But anyway
12/7/19, 1:10 AM - Marianna: Well I am very very glad to hear you think that
12/7/19, 1:10 AM - Marianna: Genuinely makes me happy
12/7/19, 1:10 AM - Marianna: (as long as I get to be hot AND smart)
12/7/19, 1:11 AM - Marianna: But you should look in a mirror you are such a wonderful looking person like wow
12/7/19, 1:11 AM - Marianna: So very attractive can‚Äôt wait until I see you again
12/7/19, 1:11 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm like falling asleep
12/7/19, 1:11 AM - Marianna: We never made it out to the jaegerbomb party or the club...
12/7/19, 1:37 AM - Marianna: Hi I‚Äôd like to issue a complaint my bed is too cold I would request the presence of my personal furnace
12/7/19, 1:37 AM - Marianna: ‚ù§
12/7/19, 1:37 AM - Marianna: Okay sleep time for drunk marianna. Goodnight!
12/7/19, 1:41 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/7/19, 1:42 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/7/19, 1:42 AM - Marianna: Spot the difference
12/7/19, 11:00 AM - Caleb: Awesome, looking forward to being spontaneous with you in a month :)
12/7/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: But the not-in-huge-trouble type
12/7/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: Calculated risks and all that
12/7/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: And NOOOOOOO
12/7/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: THE CLUB!
12/7/19, 11:01 AM - Caleb: I feel like this happens more than I expected
12/7/19, 11:02 AM - Caleb: When I was at your place, I just thought I was probably the main reason for wanting to stay in but hey I guess not
12/7/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: also AWWWWWW THAT'S SO CUTE
12/7/19, 11:03 AM - Caleb: And good morning!
12/7/19, 11:15 AM - Marianna: Gooood morning
12/7/19, 11:15 AM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed
12/7/19, 11:16 AM - Marianna: Yeah I thought I‚Äôd want to go out a ton because I do at davidson but I think I don‚Äôt like being drunk in unfamiliar places and not surrounded by people that I know and as crazy as it is I‚Äôm comfortable at F usually
12/7/19, 11:17 AM - Marianna: But how are you today!  Got plans?  Homework?  Hanging out?  Sleeping?
12/7/19, 11:37 AM - Marianna: Update we‚Äôre gonna go thrift shopping we think
12/7/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: Yeah that makes sense
12/7/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: I enjoy stumbling up the hill and being in bed
12/7/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: At least Copenhagen is nice because of our 24 metro, so you always know how to get home
12/7/19, 11:48 AM - Caleb: But when I leave Woo and Derek's at 2:15, it means I'm probably gonna be in bed at like 3 and that's kinda just a sad feeling
12/7/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: And I'm just working during the day, doing some studying, and once more trying to go to Tivoli tonight
12/7/19, 11:49 AM - Caleb: What about you? Thrift shopping sounds awesome, anything after that?
12/7/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: Where do woo and Derek live?
12/7/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: And ooooh send tivoli pictures!
12/7/19, 12:15 PM - Marianna: And then we‚Äôre going to another one of the baths
12/7/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: They live in Amager which is a separate island
12/7/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: So it's a bit of a hike
12/7/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: And oh that sounds like SO much fun
12/7/19, 12:16 PM - Caleb: Probably perfect in the cold
12/7/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: Woah I didn‚Äôt realize that. Are they at a home stay?
12/7/19, 12:38 PM - Marianna: I know!  I hope it‚Äôs gonna feel nice. Like immediately getting out of the pool is gonna be brutal but the warmth is gonna be so nice
12/7/19, 12:44 PM - Caleb: Haaaa
12/7/19, 12:44 PM - Caleb: They were
12/7/19, 12:44 PM - Caleb: And then they moved outb
12/7/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: Well she kinda embezzled their food money and kicked them out tbh
12/7/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: But it's fine
12/7/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: They got more money from the school and awesome housing
12/7/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: And OH my gosh
12/7/19, 12:45 PM - Caleb: That reminds me
12/7/19, 12:46 PM - Caleb: In Oregon we used to have a hot tub, and when it would snow we'd all go hang out in their and play some game where if you lost, you'd have to get out and run around the tennis court
12/7/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: Oh darn that sounds aweful
12/7/19, 12:51 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad that got it figured out
12/7/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: But I think that would be so stressful in a foreign country to be like wait where do I live now
12/7/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: And oooh that sounds so fun
12/7/19, 12:52 PM - Marianna: Yeah I feel like hot tub in the snow is definitely on my bucket list
12/7/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'd highly recommend it
12/7/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: It's ultra comfy
12/7/19, 12:56 PM - Caleb: Especially if it's ACTUALLY snowing while you're in there
12/7/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Sounds like a winter wonderland
12/7/19, 12:58 PM - Marianna: Hey
12/7/19, 12:59 PM - Marianna: What‚Äôs your favorite Christmas song
12/7/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Okay
12/7/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Son
12/7/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: So*
12/7/19, 1:04 PM - Caleb: Overall, it's gotta be the First Noel
12/7/19, 1:05 PM - Caleb: If it's a good choral arrangement, when they hit that last "noellllll noooooELLLLLLLl" it's absolutely splendid
12/7/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: But there's this one song I play every year in the Christmas orchestra at church that gives me chills but I can never rember it
12/7/19, 1:06 PM - Caleb: Carol of the Bells is also WAY up there
12/7/19, 1:10 PM - Caleb: I don't know if you count the Ave Maria a Christmas Carol, but if it is, then that's also way way up there
12/7/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: All good one
12/7/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Ones**
12/7/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: I think my overall is carol of the bells
12/7/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: Also really like Santa baby
12/7/19, 3:48 PM - Marianna: White Christmas and baby it‚Äôs cold outside are good as well
12/7/19, 3:49 PM - Marianna: They‚Äôre all so good I think because I have memories of associating them with this time of the year
12/7/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Nah
12/7/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Best Christmas carols:
12/7/19, 3:52 PM - Caleb: Whatever we're listening to if you're cuddled up with me
12/7/19, 3:53 PM - Caleb: Hands down
12/7/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: üòä
12/7/19, 4:11 PM - Marianna: Such a good night
12/7/19, 4:12 PM - Marianna: Like genuinely it felt so nice if you‚Äôd have added a fireplace it would have been ultimate cozy but it was already sooooooo good
12/7/19, 4:20 PM - Marianna: Hey miss you

12/7/19, 5:01 PM - Marianna: And ‚Äúis Budapest a country?  Is hungary a country?  Are they the same country?‚Äù
12/7/19, 5:56 PM - Caleb: Marion

12/7/19, 5:57 PM - Caleb: What
12/7/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/7/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: She‚Äôs so smart
12/7/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: That sometimes she‚Äôs so not
12/7/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Also!
12/7/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Thrift shopping was a success!
12/7/19, 6:10 PM - Marianna: Very fun I really never do it but now I want to it‚Äôs so satisfying getting cute things for low prices
12/7/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: I LOVE THRIFT SHOPPING!
12/7/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: We should go next semester!
12/7/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: Also I honestly think you'd like some parts of Christiania
12/7/19, 6:16 PM - Caleb: It's grown on me
12/7/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: Not the drug part
12/7/19, 6:17 PM - Caleb: But once you're away from the drugs it's super cozy and fun
12/7/19, 6:20 PM - Caleb: Like right now we're in this adorable candlelit market
12/7/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: And everything is so cheap because they refuse to pay taxes
12/7/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: And it's run by super friendly volunteers
12/7/19, 6:21 PM - Caleb: And there's live volunteer music
12/7/19, 6:23 PM - Caleb: This place is the wet dream of John Lennon
12/7/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: I haven‚Äôt really done it a lot!
12/7/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: But okay!
12/7/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: And okay that sounds nice
12/7/19, 6:25 PM - Marianna: Well not the wet dream part
12/7/19, 6:26 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs an awful way to describe anything
12/7/19, 6:27 PM - Marianna: Eugh
12/7/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: ... John Lennon reincarnated?
12/7/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: Yeah there we go
12/7/19, 6:27 PM - Caleb: More palatable
12/7/19, 6:28 PM - Caleb: Huh, I guess I never really gave thought to that phrase
12/7/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Better
12/7/19, 6:41 PM - Marianna: Much better
12/7/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: I don‚Äôt want to ever hear a wet dream of John Lennon ever again
12/7/19, 6:42 PM - Marianna: Makes me ask the question if anyone has ever actually had one and I don‚Äôt want to think about that or know the answer
12/7/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: My bad
12/7/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: Oh well
12/7/19, 6:54 PM - Caleb: Hey how's your night going?
12/7/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs okay
12/7/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: I will forgive you
12/7/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: But only because you‚Äôre so handsome
12/7/19, 7:02 PM - Marianna: (And smart and kind and funny)

12/7/19, 10:06 PM - Marianna: No

12/7/19, 10:36 PM - Caleb: But fiiiine
12/7/19, 10:36 PM - Marianna: When I wear outfits for the first time it‚Äôs a big deal because you get to do it only once!

12/7/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Well that settles it
12/7/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: It's happening

12/7/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: Please
12/7/19, 11:02 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm a curious fellow
12/7/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: ^
12/7/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Question: do you have a song (or songs) that just speak to your soul
12/7/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Probably
12/7/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Idk what it is though
12/7/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Oh
12/7/19, 11:19 PM - Marianna: Might not like me
12/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: Good song though
12/7/19, 11:21 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs been my jam for a while
12/7/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: No no
12/7/19, 11:23 PM - Caleb: Not just a jam
12/7/19, 11:24 PM - Caleb: Something that your soul stares into, and it stares back
12/7/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: I want to say it does
12/7/19, 11:28 PM - Marianna: Listen to it
12/7/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: My dad heard it on the radio and thought of me and then told me and cried because he thought it sounded like how I am
12/7/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Why is that adorable, wholesome, and heartbreaking all at the same time
12/7/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: I'll give it a listen
12/7/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: I really identify as it
12/7/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Or maybe my ego does
12/7/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: Idk
12/7/19, 11:46 PM - Marianna: How are you doing
12/7/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Mar
12/7/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: You'd be so proud of me
12/7/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: First off
12/7/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: I'm eating almost a straight block of cheese
12/7/19, 11:47 PM - Caleb: Second off
12/7/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: My ego is in full swing
12/7/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Third off
12/7/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: We're having an intervention with Derek for an awful love interest he's being spineless over
12/7/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: It's a good night
12/7/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: I think sober Caleb would not like be being proud of any of those things
12/7/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm glad about the cheese and the ego though
12/7/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: What has caused this for your ego?
12/7/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: And wait what is this about Derek?
12/7/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: But overall I‚Äôm glad you are having a goodnight
12/8/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: Because it just is
12/8/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: It's one of those nights that I feel socially in control
12/8/19, 12:04 AM - Caleb: And I swear not in a creepy way
12/8/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: It just feels like I have full reign over the group and I'm in control of discussion and it's just glowing
12/8/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Flowing
12/8/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: It's great
12/8/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: I just got them to watch a 14 minute video on making cloth banded cheddar cheese and they LOVED it
12/8/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: It's a good time
12/8/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: And why wouldn't sober me like that?
12/8/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: Like
12/8/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: Jokes are landing
12/8/19, 12:08 AM - Caleb: Things are fresh and interesting

12/8/19, 12:48 AM - Marianna: But yeah
12/8/19, 12:48 AM - Marianna: We went to show marion and the lights were all out and the door was closed with a closed sign
12/8/19, 12:48 AM - Marianna: :(
12/8/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: Aw

12/8/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: Also
12/8/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: Getting hit on in a bar is quite the interesting experience
12/8/19, 12:57 AM - Caleb: How do you deal with this all the time
12/8/19, 1:08 AM - Caleb: I've never been more hype than the second I heard "it's Britney bitch"
12/8/19, 1:44 AM - Caleb: Derek found his girl
12/8/19, 1:44 AM - Caleb: And is now refusing to talk to get

12/8/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: But seriously only I get to hit on you
12/8/19, 2:03 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a good start to a song you know the next few minutes are gonna be great

12/8/19, 2:56 AM - Marianna: But re: the whiskey: you all good over there?
12/8/19, 2:56 AM - Marianna: I know babe is out of the questions but drunk me has defaulted to calling you lover boy in my head when I‚Äôm typing texts. Thoughts on this?
12/8/19, 2:57 AM - Marianna: Like think dirty dancing
12/8/19, 2:57 AM - Marianna: That‚Äôs the kind of vibe
12/8/19, 2:58 AM - Caleb: Mar
12/8/19, 2:58 AM - Caleb: Oh L√òBER BOYYY
12/8/19, 2:58 AM - Caleb: I'm okay with this
12/8/19, 2:58 AM - Caleb: Any sign of affection from you  makes me smile cheek to cheek
12/8/19, 2:59 AM - Caleb: So don't worrub
12/8/19, 2:59 AM - Caleb: I'll be peachy
12/8/19, 2:59 AM - Caleb: I'm also tastefully shitfaced for 3AM
12/8/19, 2:59 AM - Caleb: Okay slightly beyond tastefully
12/8/19, 2:59 AM - Caleb: And I hope you're drunk too or this will be embarrassing
12/8/19, 3:02 AM - Marianna: Me is
12/8/19, 3:02 AM - Marianna: En is
12/8/19, 3:02 AM - Marianna: (Means I am in Hungarian)
12/8/19, 3:03 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an accent in there somewhere t
12/8/19, 3:03 AM - Marianna: Okay lover boy
12/8/19, 3:03 AM - Marianna: Let‚Äôs hope drunk marianna uses this power wisely
12/8/19, 3:03 AM - Marianna: Hi I will give you all the affection so you are always smiling I‚Äôd be happy with that arrangement
12/8/19, 3:04 AM - Marianna: Okay. Sleep time. Goodnight!
12/8/19, 3:25 AM - Caleb: SOMEONE STOLE MY BIKE AGAIN
12/8/19, 3:25 AM - Caleb: WHAT IS THIS BULLSHIT
12/8/19, 3:26 AM - Caleb: IT WAS LOCKED THIS TIME
12/8/19, 3:41 AM - Caleb: Who steals a bike with TWO FUCKING LOCKS
12/8/19, 3:46 AM - Caleb: Oh my gosh
12/8/19, 3:46 AM - Caleb: I'm so excited to sleep with your next semester
12/8/19, 3:46 AM - Caleb: Not even sex
12/8/19, 3:47 AM - Caleb: Literally just coming back and drunk cuddling with you
12/8/19, 3:47 AM - Caleb: It'll be so amazing
12/8/19, 3:47 AM - Caleb: I mean yeah I'm looking forward to that too
12/8/19, 3:47 AM - Caleb: But oh my gosh
12/8/19, 3:47 AM - Caleb: You're just so incredibly comfortable to be around
12/8/19, 3:48 AM - Caleb: I'm just so relaxed and happy around your
12/8/19, 3:48 AM - Caleb: And I'm in bed now so goodnight!
12/8/19, 3:49 AM - Caleb: Ps 35 days
12/8/19, 3:49 AM - Caleb: Night :)
12/8/19, 11:25 AM - Marianna: Did you get home okay even without your bike?
12/8/19, 11:26 AM - Marianna: At least it happened at the end of the semester
12/8/19, 11:26 AM - Marianna: I think you‚Äôre cursed
12/8/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: But yes you can hang around me and maybe you‚Äôll be less cursed!
12/8/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: Yeah I‚Äôm very excited for cuddles
12/8/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: I like cuddles
12/8/19, 11:27 AM - Marianna: And good morning!
12/8/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: Goooooooood morning
12/8/19, 11:30 AM - Caleb: I'm so tired
12/8/19, 11:31 AM - Caleb: And yeah I just ended up walking back
12/8/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: I'll probably head over to the station today to look around for it
12/8/19, 11:32 AM - Caleb: It had to locks on it, and it wasn't particularly nice, so I'm guessing a drunk person saw it and started carrying it but put it down nearby when they got bored
12/8/19, 11:40 AM - Marianna: It wasn‚Äôt locked to something?
12/8/19, 11:41 AM - Marianna: And didn‚Äôt you just rent it?  What happens if it got stolen with them?
12/8/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: Nah it has a lock that goes through the back wheel
12/8/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: So you can pick it up and move it but it doesn't make a very good bike then
12/8/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: Idk
12/8/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: I'll figure it out
12/8/19, 11:47 AM - Caleb: How are you? How was your night?
12/8/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: Yeah don‚Äôt stress about it I guess there‚Äôs not exactly anything to be done about it now
12/8/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: And I‚Äôm good!
12/8/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: Last night was good
12/8/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: We didn‚Äôt dance for too long at instant
12/8/19, 11:49 AM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm just really over the club thing
12/8/19, 11:50 AM - Marianna: Did get a new instant cup though!

12/8/19, 11:51 AM - Marianna: But we left because we were like yeah not feeling it we‚Äôre not sober and ready for bed

12/8/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: And now 2 again
12/8/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: So I‚Äôm tired
12/8/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: That's awesome
12/8/19, 11:52 AM - Caleb: But not for your sleep schedule
12/8/19, 11:52 AM - Marianna: I think Sarahs still asleep
12/8/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: But we gotta get crakalacking to breakfast and the baths
12/8/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: I was up until 4 last night and that's the first time in a LONG time
12/8/19, 11:53 AM - Caleb: I'm telling ya, Jager bombs do it to me
12/8/19, 11:53 AM - Marianna: I mean they are Red Bull
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Yeah
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Yeah they are
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: I'm sure we'll do some next semester
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Noooooo
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: Sleep is precious
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: My PReCIOUs
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: I was about to finish
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: Geez
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Caleb: We'll just do them early in the night
12/8/19, 11:54 AM - Marianna: I like getting drunk and then hard sleeping
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Okay but still if I have caffeine after 4pm I‚Äôm up until 4am
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: .... Jager bombs when class gets out?
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Jkjk
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Until frolics
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: But I guess that wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing in the world if we can find something to fill the time
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Marianna: Ohhhh frolics might be the move
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Than it's a pre-class Jager bomb
12/8/19, 11:55 AM - Caleb: Then*
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Marianna: No no more drinking I‚Äôm class for this one
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: My dad would be so disappointed in me
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Not for joking about drinking before class
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: But then -> than
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: Ooooohoho
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: I like where this is going
12/8/19, 11:56 AM - Caleb: We can debug
12/8/19, 11:57 AM - Caleb: Or watch a movie if we're really feeling WiLd
12/8/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Haha than/then is a very important distinction
12/8/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: My last class Friday with be chartiers math modeling
12/8/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Oh!  Yes!  Debugging!
12/8/19, 11:59 AM - Marianna: Exactly what I was thinking!
12/8/19, 11:59 AM - Caleb: Woah mE tOo
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: I mean we‚Äôll have time why not debugg and THEN movie?
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Marianna: Wouldn‚Äôt discrete be after?
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Only if we can make a pillow fort
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: And at the moment I don't have discrete
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: So no
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: But if I get it
12/8/19, 12:00 PM - Caleb: Then yes
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: I think as soon as you fill out the ceiling exemption thing you‚Äôll be good
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: Idk how where or when to do that
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Marianna: OH PILLOW FORT I have so many pillows
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: I literally filled it out on the first day of add drop
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: And OH MY GOSH
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: Can we actually
12/8/19, 12:01 PM - Caleb: It would be so much fun
12/8/19, 12:02 PM - Caleb: I'm not even joking Mar
12/8/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: I thought that was the waitlist thing
12/8/19, 12:02 PM - Marianna: Idk
12/8/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: And yes
12/8/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: We can fully do this
12/8/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: If we ever find time
12/8/19, 12:03 PM - Marianna: Sarahs gonna come back and be like what the heck
12/8/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I mean
12/8/19, 12:03 PM - Caleb: I've always got a room
12/8/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: We could just carry them over and make Fort Awesome at my place
12/8/19, 12:04 PM - Caleb: And then have people look at us like we're insane as we carry huge armfuls of pillows across campus
12/8/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: Wait a second
12/8/19, 12:06 PM - Caleb: If I have a dingle does that mean I have two mattresses
12/8/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Oh really don‚Äôt want to carry all my pillows across campus
12/8/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: But I did freshman year
12/8/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: We always all hung out on Marions floor in watts and I‚Äôd bring my pillows so people could be comfy
12/8/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: And idk that‚Äôs a good question
12/8/19, 12:07 PM - Marianna: Like what would they do with the extra bed if they didn‚Äôt just keep it in there?
12/8/19, 12:08 PM - Marianna: But also if that room is always the ra maybe there‚Äôs only 1 bed to begin with
12/8/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: Throwback to when Sam and I pulled our mattresses across Belk and had a sleepover in Jenn and Meredith's room
12/8/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: That was so so so much fun
12/8/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/8/19, 12:08 PM - Caleb: That would imply RLO knows what they're doing
12/8/19, 12:09 PM - Caleb: Maybe I should hold out on buying bed sheets until I have an answer
12/8/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh I hope I can have a double bed
12/8/19, 12:12 PM - Caleb: That'd be heaven
12/8/19, 12:25 PM - Marianna: I think you all were the power dream team of hallcounselors
12/8/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Mostly because you‚Äôre all great people in my mind
12/8/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: Oh true sorry to give rlo more credit than it deserves
12/8/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: And well my little did that and says it‚Äôs not actually as awesome as it sounds because there a gap between the two beds
12/8/19, 12:26 PM - Marianna: And wait don‚Äôt you already have sheets?
12/8/19, 12:27 PM - Marianna: But you‚Äôre a davidson student I‚Äôm sure if you do you could rig something up to fill the gap
12/8/19, 12:28 PM - Marianna: Oh also I realized it too late last night but happy 2 months!
12/8/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs most remarkable because I can‚Äôt believe you were here 2 MONTHS ago like it felt like a week ago
12/8/19, 12:29 PM - Marianna: Time has flown abroad
12/8/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: I have sheets but they're cheap target ones
12/8/19, 12:30 PM - Caleb: And it's for a twin XL
12/8/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: But in Scandinavia it's pretty common to use a fitted mattress cover that keeps both of them together
12/8/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: And WOAH
12/8/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/8/19, 12:36 PM - Caleb: Happy two months
12/8/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: It's been nice talking to you every day
12/8/19, 12:37 PM - Caleb: Can't wait to actually be with you again :)
12/8/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Hey don‚Äôt hate on target
12/8/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: It has been nice
12/8/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: Thanks for dealing with me and my craziness for 2 months
12/8/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: And honeslty more of you count over the summer
12/8/19, 2:34 PM - Marianna: At the baths now!  We went to a different one than last time so I‚Äôm excited!
12/8/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: That sounds awesome!
12/8/19, 4:17 PM - Caleb: How is/was it?
12/8/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Oh soooo nice
12/8/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: I like the other one better but whatever
12/8/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: Still nice
12/8/19, 5:06 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll send pictures later if you want!
12/8/19, 5:09 PM - Marianna: Oh my hair is so curly and low key looks more red
12/8/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Oooooo
12/8/19, 5:09 PM - Caleb: Sounds super fun
12/8/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: I'd love pictures! Of the place and now your hair
12/8/19, 5:10 PM - Caleb: I saw the picture on your snap and it may or may not have made me Google how much a flight from Philly is
12/8/19, 5:13 PM - Marianna: From philly?  You‚Äôre not back yet
12/8/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Just change your return flight through here ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/8/19, 5:14 PM - Marianna: Kidding I have to do homework I‚Äôd be no fun and don‚Äôt need a caleb to distract me and I don‚Äôt want to know how much changing it would cost
12/8/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: You know
12/8/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Doesn't sound that bad
12/8/19, 5:20 PM - Caleb: Maybe if you weren't in the middle of finals and had actual free time I'd consider it haha
12/8/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Besides I'm just really looking forward to home
12/8/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: But GOSH DARN
12/8/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: One day

12/8/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: Idk you just are
12/8/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: If I recall correctly I just asked you one day
12/8/19, 7:16 PM - Marianna: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/8/19, 7:17 PM - Marianna: I really want to post the gif to insta
12/8/19, 7:17 PM - Caleb: Why wouldn't you?
12/8/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Idk I usually don‚Äôt post pictures in swimsuits ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ but I think it‚Äôs cute but I dont want to be that girl who posts a ton of bikini pictures
12/8/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But like I shouldn‚Äôt not want to be that girl
12/8/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: But I do
12/8/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Idk
12/8/19, 7:23 PM - Caleb: I vote you should
12/8/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: It's one thing to post a "hahaha went to the beach look at meeeeee"
12/8/19, 7:24 PM - Caleb: And it's an ENTIRELY different thing to post "hey look at this really cool thing I did"
12/8/19, 7:25 PM - Caleb: I mean honestly I don't like to post pictures of me in swimsuits either, probably for different reasons, but I still made an exception because Greece was super cool
12/8/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk
12/8/19, 7:31 PM - Marianna: I want to but ah
12/8/19, 7:33 PM - Marianna: How has your day been?
12/8/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Well
12/8/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: Do what you're comfortable with
12/8/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: And my days been less eventful than yours
12/8/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: I've just been studying for finals
12/8/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: That's pretty much it
12/8/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: I hung out with Signe, Eskil, and Hannah and watched an incredibly cheesy Christmas sitcom
12/8/19, 7:39 PM - Caleb: And we're gonna see a movie at 9
12/8/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: I will probably post
12/8/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: THEYRE ALL SO GOOD
12/8/19, 7:43 PM - Marianna: want another cute one

12/8/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: ...
12/8/19, 7:47 PM - Caleb: Why do I have the overwhelming urge to give you a big hug right now
12/8/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: I think it‚Äôs cute
12/8/19, 7:47 PM - Marianna: I usually don‚Äôt like my profile but I do here
12/8/19, 7:48 PM - Caleb: It's an elegant pose
12/8/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 7:48 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 7:50 PM - Marianna: What movie are you seeing tonight?
12/8/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: It's apparently called Knives Out
12/8/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: I'm guessing from the name that it's horror
12/8/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Ooooh
12/8/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: right
12/8/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: ?
12/8/19, 7:55 PM - Marianna: You‚Äôre a psycho and like horror
12/8/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha
12/8/19, 7:55 PM - Caleb: I'm glad you have such a high opinion
12/8/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: I don't think I ever said that though
12/8/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Yes
12/8/19, 8:12 PM - Marianna: Because you wanted to make me watch one
12/8/19, 8:17 PM - Marianna: Okay AH IM GONNA POST

12/8/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Well shoot
12/8/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: I gotta think of a clever comment
12/8/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: I've already slacked on one post
12/8/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: How do people do this man
12/8/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: BUT YAY that's awesome
12/8/19, 8:18 PM - Caleb: Also yeah but I'm not wanting to watch a scary movie with you for the scary movie
12/8/19, 8:19 PM - Caleb: I feel like you'd be really fun to watch one with
12/8/19, 8:22 PM - Marianna: Hey you don‚Äôt have to
12/8/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 8:23 PM - Caleb: It's _kinda_ clever
12/8/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: Nooooo
12/8/19, 8:23 PM - Marianna: Haha sarah had that same comment last time I posted at the baths
12/8/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: DAMNIT
12/8/19, 8:24 PM - Caleb: Oh well
12/8/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: Hey

12/8/19, 8:25 PM - Marianna: And yeah okay I‚Äôll watch a horror movie with you but only if we can be under my heated blanket and have snackies
12/8/19, 8:25 PM - Caleb: Dealio

12/8/19, 8:34 PM - Caleb: Really twisted my arm for that one
12/8/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/8/19, 8:36 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a skill
12/8/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: Hey
12/8/19, 8:36 PM - Caleb: I spent about five minutes trying to think of a clever and original comment
12/8/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: And then just decided I'd rather just tell you it because that's more my style
12/8/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: I think you look really really great in your Instagram picture
12/8/19, 8:37 PM - Caleb: It's really awesome seeing pictures of you because its just fun being reminded of you, and also I can show you off a little ;)
12/8/19, 8:37 PM - Marianna: Alright
12/8/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: But yeah, not comment worthy
12/8/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: Sorry
12/8/19, 8:38 PM - Caleb: You'll just have to deal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/8/19, 8:38 PM - Marianna: Odd to phrase it as ‚Äúa Instagram comment‚Äù later but alright
12/8/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: Well thank you
12/8/19, 8:39 PM - Marianna: I may take it down

12/8/19, 8:42 PM - Caleb: My question
12/8/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: If you could ask the Dalai lama one question
12/8/19, 8:43 PM - Caleb: What would it be
12/8/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: Caleb
12/8/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: Who is the Dalai Lama
12/8/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: I like know he‚Äôs an important person
12/8/19, 8:46 PM - Marianna: But I‚Äôve never actually known what for
12/8/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: Who ARE you?????
12/8/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: And you give me shit for not having seen a bunch of movies???
12/8/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: He's that guy
12/8/19, 8:49 PM - Caleb: The leader of Tibetan Buddhism
12/8/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: Okay
12/8/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: But like what would I ask him
12/8/19, 8:50 PM - Marianna: Is he all knowing or something
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: He's like the pope of Eastern religion
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: Probably more important actually
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: Okay
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: So kinda?
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: But like I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily have a question to ask the pope
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Marianna: What would you ask him?
12/8/19, 8:51 PM - Caleb: But it's all very earthly
12/8/19, 8:52 PM - Caleb: I think I'd ask him if there is one piece of advice people should remind themselves of in tough times
12/8/19, 8:55 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs a good one
12/8/19, 8:55 PM - Marianna: Idk
12/8/19, 8:55 PM - Marianna: You know I‚Äôm awful at questions
12/8/19, 8:55 PM - Marianna: Although I recently did come up with one to ask when you next do the whole ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù thing
12/8/19, 8:55 PM - Marianna: But I don‚Äôt remember what it is now
12/8/19, 8:56 PM - Marianna: Hopefully it will come back to me
12/8/19, 8:58 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôll think on what I‚Äôd ask him though
12/8/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Oh wow
12/8/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: I haven't done that in a while
12/8/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: I'll be sure to ask next time
12/8/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: Hey
12/8/19, 9:05 PM - Caleb: How are ya
12/8/19, 9:13 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm good

12/8/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: But I think I‚Äôm gonna FaceTime my mom which will be fun
12/8/19, 9:14 PM - Marianna: And more procrastination but whatever
12/8/19, 9:15 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm jealous and not that Marions going home so soon like she only has 4 more days in Europe but ah it‚Äôs gonna be nice to land in philly and see my parents and go home
12/8/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh
12/8/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: That movie was incredible
12/8/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: You would have LOVED it
12/8/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Wasn't a horror movie
12/8/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: It was a whodubnnit movie
12/8/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: I GOT MY BIKE BACK

12/8/19, 11:46 PM - Caleb: Idk why they invited me but I'm glad they did
12/8/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Who is eskil ?!?!
12/8/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: This is hannah who got broken up with this semester?
12/8/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: She found a Dane!
12/8/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: Or another dis kid!
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Yay!
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Hannah's Norwegian flatmate/rebound/boyfriendish
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Oh right the flat mate!
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: I do love whodunnits
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: But would not want to third wheel
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: But hey at least the movie was good
12/8/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: AND YAY WHERE WAS THE BIKE
12/8/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: It was lying in the grass a good bit away from the metro
12/8/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Well fairly close but still it was raining so it felt far
12/8/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: But hey!
12/8/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: How has your night been?
12/8/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Good
12/8/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: We made mulled wine
12/8/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Or well warmed up a bottle of it
12/8/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: And did some work
12/8/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Hung out
12/8/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Now I‚Äôm in bed

12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: And kind of annoyed marion isn‚Äôt yet because she napped for 2 hours and messed up her sleep schedule but she‚Äôs sleeping in my room so she needs to get in here so I can get up in 7 hours
12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Gl√ºhwein
12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Marianna: Yes
12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Good stuff good stuff
12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Ah the w -> v
12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Classic blunder
12/8/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Ahhhh that's frustrating
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Classic
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: Is she in your flat?
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Almost like you don‚Äôt speak german
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: Or is she out
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Or Hungarian for that matter
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: Caught me
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Nah she‚Äôs here
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: Hey wait you don't either
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: She may be showering
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Hungarian!
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Caleb: ... May be?
12/8/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Does the same thing!
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: Hungarian is SO not German!
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: But they do the w and v thing
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: !
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: IT'S LITERALLY NOT EVEN INDO-EUROPEAN MAR
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: No it‚Äôs not
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: Which makes it hella impressive you're learning it
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Caleb: Good jorb
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: But there is no w sound in Hungarian so they read w as a v
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: Thanks
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: Good stuff
12/8/19, 11:56 PM - Marianna: Hopefully I pass the final for it
12/8/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: Well there's no w sound in Danish
12/8/19, 11:57 PM - Marianna: Yay!
12/8/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: It's pronounced "uugudysgsjdb"
12/8/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: Hey you got this
12/8/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: I believe in you
12/8/19, 11:57 PM - Caleb: Partially because you don't shut up about things you know in Hungarian so I'm constantly impressed
12/8/19, 11:58 PM - Caleb: (I'm not saying you do it in order to make me impressed, that's just a byproduct)
12/9/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: No what‚Äôs the use of knowing a language if you don‚Äôt use it to pick up boys!
12/9/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Like oooooh I know Hungarian
12/9/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Aka the SEXIEST language on the early
12/9/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: Earth**
12/9/19, 12:02 AM - Marianna: But I do genuinely like it
12/9/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Idk
12/9/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: I think there are sexier but I might be bias
12/9/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Wait a second
12/9/19, 12:05 AM - Caleb: Just re-read that first text
12/9/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: I'm gonna backtrack and say nevermind
12/9/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: Maybe if I learn Dutch with my mom I can practice on you
12/9/19, 12:06 AM - Caleb: My grandma would be so proud
12/9/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: Yeah okay but when you bring in the fact you‚Äôre learning it with you mom for your grandma I think it loses all sex appeal
12/9/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: But this weird strain of joke aside that would be pretty cool for you and your mom and your grandma if you did
12/9/19, 12:12 AM - Marianna: But also
12/9/19, 12:13 AM - Marianna: You‚Äôre a busy boy who doesn‚Äôt exactly have time
12/9/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Yeah I thought about that after I sent the text and decided against mentioning it
12/9/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: But gee it looks like I didn't need to
12/9/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Thaaanks
12/9/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Also Dutch is NOT a sexy language
12/9/19, 12:15 AM - Caleb: Idk if you noticed that when you were in Amsterdam
12/9/19, 12:16 AM - Caleb: I think I'd have more luck if I hit you with some Swedish
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: I think we heard dutch in the sauna today
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Not entirely sure
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Hey
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: Like minds and all that...
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Marianna: And okay I‚Äôll let you sometime
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Caleb: Like minds think great üòò
12/9/19, 12:18 AM - Caleb: And cool
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: But only if you do it in the Swedish chef voice
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: I can hit you with some
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: hahahaaha
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Oh my gosh that's so much better than what I was about to type
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: (Kidding‚Äîif you ever sexualize the muppets I will leave and this k am not kidding about)
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: You win
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: You win
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: You win
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: YAY
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: I WIN
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Oh gosh
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: That's actually spooking me
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Caleb: Because it sounds like something I would have done jokingly
12/9/19, 12:19 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs a serious threat
12/9/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: It‚Äôs too much of a childhood memory
12/9/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: Sorry
12/9/19, 12:20 AM - Caleb: I dont like serious threats
12/9/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: I know I‚Äôm stunting your creative license here
12/9/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: But please this is like the one thing I ask
12/9/19, 12:20 AM - Marianna: Also this might come off as very serious on text and I‚Äôm not like uber serious about this but yeah no it would not work if you did sorry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
12/9/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: Yeah
12/9/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: I think something isn't translating well here
12/9/19, 12:21 AM - Caleb: Let's just move on please
12/9/19, 12:23 AM - Marianna: Okay
12/9/19, 12:23 AM - Marianna: Well
12/9/19, 12:23 AM - Marianna: I‚Äôm gonna go to bed...
12/9/19, 12:23 AM - Caleb: Noooooo

12/9/19, 4:05 PM - Marianna: What have you been up to today?  How has your day been?
12/9/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: Quote from class:
12/9/19, 4:48 PM - Caleb: "if they're already a corpse, you can't fuck it up more"
12/9/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: What
12/9/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: Uh
12/9/19, 5:12 PM - Marianna: I mean they‚Äôre not wrong
12/9/19, 5:12 PM - Caleb: We're getting CPR certified!
12/9/19, 5:13 PM - Caleb: And also that was from my professor!
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Uh okay random but cool!
12/9/19, 5:19 PM - Marianna: Is cpr certified an international thing?
12/9/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: Well our professors wife is a cardiologist
12/9/19, 5:21 PM - Caleb: So she came in for a short class and it's good
12/9/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: And I don't think so, but certification really means nothing anyway
12/9/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: If you know how to do it, you can do it
12/9/19, 5:22 PM - Caleb: If you don't, still try
12/9/19, 5:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah I don‚Äôt
12/9/19, 5:24 PM - Marianna: Except to the beat of stayin alive
12/9/19, 5:25 PM - Caleb: You really should!

12/9/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: Ohhh that might be fun
12/9/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: Idk your hall scares me
12/9/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: Like I don‚Äôt know anyone on it
12/9/19, 5:33 PM - Marianna: But like I don‚Äôt want to be that weird girl who‚Äôs always around or something
12/9/19, 5:34 PM - Marianna: Like I‚Äôll gladly be always around
12/9/19, 5:37 PM - Marianna: But i don‚Äôt want to make it weird for them
12/9/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: What
12/9/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Why does my hall scare you
12/9/19, 6:11 PM - Caleb: Okay then I'm personally requesting they be there

12/9/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: Unless you‚Äôre there but idk that seems sketch
12/9/19, 7:23 PM - Marianna: AND WHAT NO CALEB THINK ABOUT RUDOLF
12/9/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Well
12/9/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: If you have a private shower, maybe not üòâ
12/9/19, 7:34 PM - Caleb: Unless you're uncomfy with that
12/9/19, 7:35 PM - Caleb: But hey we'll take things as they come
12/9/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: I mean heck if you have a private shower maybe I'll keep a towel in YOUR room
12/9/19, 7:38 PM - Caleb: _kidding kidding_
12/9/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Yeah I want to see how it‚Äôs like
12/9/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: Because I do share it with 3 friends
12/9/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: And idk I wouldn‚Äôt care if they did as long as I didn‚Äôt know
12/9/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: But idk if I can lock both doors the the bathroom or what
12/9/19, 7:40 PM - Marianna: We‚Äôll see is all I will say
12/9/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Maybe we can do it but I wouldn‚Äôt want to make it a routine thing (for their sake) but we‚Äôll test the waters
12/9/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Haha
12/9/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Test the waters
12/9/19, 7:41 PM - Marianna: Ba dum ts
12/9/19, 7:50 PM - Caleb: Yeah I gotcha
12/9/19, 7:51 PM - Caleb: Also how would you feel about taking 1-2 weekend trips next semester
12/9/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Idk it depends
12/9/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: I usually stay on campus
12/9/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm honestly not sure how my parents would like that
12/9/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: Yeah I gotcha
12/9/19, 7:52 PM - Marianna: Like I think while in Europe is one thing but they might think it‚Äôs weird if I go on a trip or whatever with you while at davidson
12/9/19, 7:52 PM - Caleb: It was just super fun going on a few adventures with you in Europe
12/9/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: Ahaha yeah I gotcha no worries
12/9/19, 7:53 PM - Marianna: And I said I had wanted to go to Hilton Head to see nonna like once a month and they were like THATS SO MUCH
12/9/19, 7:53 PM - Caleb: I think it would be really fun but I totally totally get it
12/9/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: Yeah idk
12/9/19, 7:54 PM - Marianna: We can certainly talk about it and see how life next semester is like

12/9/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: Would it help if you didn't text me
12/9/19, 7:56 PM - Caleb: And I'm not saying that facetiously
12/9/19, 7:59 PM - Marianna: No
12/9/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôve done what I was asked to for now
12/9/19, 8:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm helping them

12/9/19, 8:21 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs an anti procrastination pact
12/9/19, 9:18 PM - Marianna: ALRIGHT CRYPTO IS SUBMITTED YEEEEEEEEET
12/9/19, 9:56 PM - Marianna: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 10:18 PM - Caleb: Doooooooooone

12/9/19, 10:54 PM - Caleb: But hey remeber how you said you wished you could help me unpack
12/9/19, 10:55 PM - Caleb: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: Oh yay!
12/9/19, 10:58 PM - Marianna: I mean that sucks that you have to store your stuff
12/9/19, 10:59 PM - Marianna: But I will for sure help you carry heavy boxes up 4 flights fo stairs!
12/9/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm pumped for move in
12/9/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: And davidson
12/9/19, 11:00 PM - Marianna: Oh also can I find an album and send it to you?
12/9/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: Yeah I'm not too happy
12/9/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: I'll leave most of my stuff in my car, but I'm worried about my computer
12/9/19, 11:01 PM - Caleb: So I need to figure that one out
12/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: But if you do want to help and are around, that would be awesome
12/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: And yeah! I was going to ask for one last night but I figured Marion was still there so you could get one today
12/9/19, 11:02 PM - Caleb: How did you like the last one?
12/9/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Yeah well I‚Äôm sure you know some friends who are in music groups that you can put stuff in
12/9/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: But uh where are you gonna sleep for that night?
12/9/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: Marion and a ton of chorale people are in the same boat and all crashing at an off campus house
12/9/19, 11:05 PM - Marianna: But it won‚Äôt hold all of chorale so idk if there is a plan in place
12/9/19, 11:05 PM - Caleb: Wow, look at you asking all the questions that Mary Anne should have
12/9/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Well she should have all the answers
12/9/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs no help if she has the questions
12/9/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: I'm probably just gonna crash with Lee the night before
12/9/19, 11:06 PM - Caleb: It's only like 2 hours to Davidson from his house
12/9/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: Well if Elena can let you into my half of the suite you‚Äôre welcome to crash in my room
12/9/19, 11:06 PM - Marianna: But idk if that would work
12/9/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: I actually might take you up on that
12/9/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: Maybe just for my computer though
12/9/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: And Sufjan is always a good call
12/9/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: That‚Äôs cool
12/9/19, 11:07 PM - Caleb: If she could just keep my computer, I'll just keep the rest of my stuff in my car
12/9/19, 11:07 PM - Marianna: I will probably try to text or FaceTime her before she leaves because I want to ask like are they gonna have all their stuff out of our side before we get back?  I feel like they‚Äôd have to
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah they're required to
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: And if not
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Looks like you'll get some new stuff
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Okay but it‚Äôs Elena
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Jk RLO clears it out and just fines them
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: OHHHHHH that's right
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: I forgot they're just switching rooms aren't they
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Caleb: Yeah I think she's still requires to have her stuff, and RLO still does a room condition report
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: But sarah and I do have an assigned room
12/9/19, 11:08 PM - Marianna: Idk which one
12/9/19, 11:09 PM - Caleb: So it'll still be cleaned out
12/9/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/9/19, 11:09 PM - Marianna: PUMPED
12/9/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: I can‚Äôt wait to move in
12/9/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Well I can
12/9/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: First home
12/9/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: And then davidson
12/9/19, 11:10 PM - Marianna: Which my mom refuses to let me call home
12/9/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: Aw
12/9/19, 11:19 PM - Caleb: :(
12/9/19, 11:20 PM - Caleb: That's kinda sad and kinda sweet
12/9/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Yeah
12/9/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: But I also call hotel rooms home when on vacation
12/9/19, 11:23 PM - Marianna: Like home is where I am gonna sleep that night I think
12/9/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Huh
12/9/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Well it makes sense I guess
12/9/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Maybe people put too much value into the word home
12/9/19, 11:26 PM - Caleb: Or maybe it's just whoever you're with
12/9/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: Sappy ALERT
12/9/19, 11:27 PM - Marianna: maybe
12/9/19, 11:27 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha sorry I'll calm down üòÅ
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: Good
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: No I‚Äôm kidding it‚Äôs fine
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: I can be sappy
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: *can* be
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Marianna: But it‚Äôs weird I generally keep my sap to myself I think
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: Aw
12/9/19, 11:29 PM - Caleb: So cute
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: I tend to do that too
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Sometimes I'll write it out for myself though
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: Or I'll just write something
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: How is that cute
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: It‚Äôs just me
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: .
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: And yeah
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Caleb: ^^^
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: I write stuff in my notes
12/9/19, 11:30 PM - Marianna: Did more over the summer
12/9/19, 11:31 PM - Marianna: Oh man now I‚Äôm gonna look at the list of things I liked when you were in dc when I realized I liked you
12/9/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: Oh geez
12/9/19, 11:31 PM - Caleb: I don't even know whats on there and I'm probably not yet somehow I'm still blushing
12/9/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Okay I‚Äôm back
12/9/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Things I wrote seem so much less crazy to me now
12/9/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: Like I read it and I was like yeah that‚Äôs just caleb
12/9/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: Ah
12/9/19, 11:34 PM - Caleb: Sorry boot that
12/9/19, 11:34 PM - Marianna: But it was so like woah!  New!  Person!  When I I wrote it
12/9/19, 11:35 PM - Caleb: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/9/19, 11:35 PM - Marianna: Capitalization there is a mess but whatever
12/9/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Dontcha hate it when the magic wears off
12/9/19, 11:36 PM - Caleb: Gosh darn
12/9/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: No no not that
12/9/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: Certainly not that
12/9/19, 11:36 PM - Marianna: More like wow it‚Äôs been 5 months since dc
12/9/19, 11:37 PM - Marianna: Right?
12/9/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: Yeah, late July I think?
12/9/19, 11:37 PM - Caleb: It's been a hot second
12/9/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: Still retrospectively hilarious and weird to me, but I'm very glad I did it
12/9/19, 11:38 PM - Caleb: _very_
12/9/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah it was after I got back from California
12/9/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: Hilarious and weird??
12/9/19, 11:38 PM - Marianna: What makes you say that?
12/9/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: Just the situation
12/9/19, 11:39 PM - Caleb: I barely know this girl but think she's pretty cool, and she barely knows me but kicked me out like a month and a half prior, and here I am staying with her for a weekend
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: If that's not absurd I don't know what is
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: Okay fair
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: When you put it like THAT
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Hehehhe
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Marianna: who knows what we were doing
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: It honestly had no right to be as amazing as it was
12/9/19, 11:40 PM - Caleb: Like who are you
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: Me?
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Yup
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: What has that got to do with me?
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Well
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: Honestly
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Marianna: It was just a great weekend
12/9/19, 11:41 PM - Caleb: I think if it were anyone else it wouldn't have been nearly that fun
12/9/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: That was the weekend that confirmed that we had really great chemistry
12/9/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: Oh my gosh you should have seen me and Elise's trip to Charleston
12/9/19, 11:42 PM - Caleb: It was one day and an _absolute_ disaster
12/9/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: Well I am glad we can travel together and see things fun in the world well
12/9/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: And well I probably wouldn‚Äôt have but yeah I get the idea
12/9/19, 11:43 PM - Marianna: When‚Äôd you go to charleston?
12/9/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: I feel like I‚Äôve only driven though it or flown into it
12/9/19, 11:44 PM - Marianna: But I may have been there I don‚Äôt remember
12/9/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: It was Easter break freshman year
12/9/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: I went and stayed with her family for it, and then we took a day trip to Charleston
12/9/19, 11:45 PM - Caleb: Honestly me too
12/9/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: Gotta say it's a nice thing to know that I can spend almost a full week with you and still not be tired of you
12/9/19, 11:48 PM - Caleb: I'm no relationship expert but I'd call that a good sign
12/9/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Oh I went to harvard Easter break freshman year!
12/9/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Well yeah I know news for you kid we may have to spend more than a well together next semester
12/9/19, 11:48 PM - Marianna: Although it won‚Äôt be as constant as your time here was
12/9/19, 11:49 PM - Marianna: But that was quite nice too
12/9/19, 11:49 PM - Caleb: Indeed
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Gloria Duplex by Henry Jamison

12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: We'll see what my schedule looks like
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: I think I‚Äôm gonna try this one
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Haven‚Äôt listened to it all
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: I'm debating picking up a 5th class
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: But good vibes
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Marianna: Caleb hi don‚Äôt kill yourself you admitted last semester was crazy
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/9/19, 11:50 PM - Caleb: But you've got something to learn about me
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: And as someone who‚Äôs currently taking 5 it‚Äôs not always great
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Oh I'm aware
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Marianna: Very much regret it currently
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Ahahaha
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Yeah
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: But for some reason it's kind of addicting to me
12/9/19, 11:51 PM - Caleb: Like if I have a boring semester, I'm gonna go insane
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Caleb: I ALWAYS want something to do
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Hi
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Me
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Kidding
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: Do your class first
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: I guess
12/9/19, 11:52 PM - Marianna: I‚Äôm that way too but I feel like there always is something to do on campus
12/9/19, 11:53 PM - Caleb: Well
12/9/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Like i found I didn‚Äôt read as much or have time to watch movies as much in college because if I had free time I‚Äôd nap or just hang out with friends
12/9/19, 11:53 PM - Marianna: Those are great ways to fill time in my opimion
12/9/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: So what I'm hearing is that I should get some naps with you?
12/9/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Oof tough sell but I think I'm in
12/9/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: But honestly I think I'd have time still
12/9/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: I mean and I won't even be working 3 jobs
12/9/19, 11:54 PM - Caleb: Just 2
12/9/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Oh yeah what am I talking about SOOO much more time
12/9/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Alright
12/9/19, 11:55 PM - Marianna: Sleep time
